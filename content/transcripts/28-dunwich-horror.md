## Transcript

**[00:00]** Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of horror all the

**[00:06]** signboards pointing towards it have been taken down.

**[00:10]** The scenery, judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful, yet

**[00:15]** there's no influx of artists or summer tourists.

**[00:20]** Two centuries ago, when talk of witch blood, Satan worship, and strange forest presences

**[00:25]** was not laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality.

**[00:31]** In our sensible age, since that Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the

**[00:36]** towns and the world's welfare at heart, people shun it without knowing exactly why.

**[00:42]** Perhaps one reason, though it cannot apply to uninformed strangers, is that the natives

**[00:46]** are now repellently decadent, having gone far along that path of retro-aggression so

**[00:52]** common in many New England backwaters.

**[00:55]** They have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-defined mental and physical

**[00:59]** stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding.

**[01:03]** The average of their intelligence is woefully low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness

**[01:09]** and of half-hidden murders, incest, and deeds of almost unnameable violence and perversity.

**[01:16]** The old gentry, representing the two or three armigerous families which came from Salem

**[01:20]** in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay, though many branches are sunk

**[01:26]** into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin

**[01:32]** they disgrace.

**[01:34]** Some of the Whateleys and bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and Miskatonic,

**[01:39]** though those sons seldom return to the moldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors

**[01:43]** were born.

**[01:50]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[02:07]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[02:11]** I hope you're doing well wherever you are.

**[02:14]** I'm sitting around trying to bask in the spooky season for as long as possible.

**[02:19]** I don't have a lot of small talk for today's episode because I've been recording before

**[02:24]** work.

**[02:25]** I'm very excited to make this one, maybe my favorite episode I've made so far, and that's

**[02:30]** because we are covering the Dunwich Horror Neutral Expansion.

**[02:36]** I read a little bit in the intro there from this story, and I'm going to be not shy about

**[02:41]** doing that throughout the episode.

**[02:44]** This expansion is based on the story of the same name by H.P.

**[02:48]** Lovecraft that was published in 1928.

**[02:52]** Definitely my favorite of all of his stories, and it's not particularly close.

**[02:58]** This is a story about a family, the Waitleys, and their doings in the town of Dunwich, and

**[03:06]** some of the really bad stuff that ended up happening in 1928.

**[03:11]** The story's great.

**[03:13]** I'll take some time in the intro to tell you why, maybe instead of doing a little bit of

**[03:15]** small talk.

**[03:17]** If you've read a lot of Lovecraft's other stories, they tend to be kind of cryptic,

**[03:24]** and maybe there are things that are really bad that are being hinted at, and they're

**[03:28]** not actually being directly seen or referenced.

**[03:33]** One example would be Call of Cthulhu, maybe his most famous story.

**[03:38]** Not until the end of the story does stuff actually seem to be happening.

**[03:43]** A lot of it is reading articles that are collected.

**[03:48]** It's not so with Dunwich.

**[03:50]** Right from the beginning of the story, you get the sense that this family is doing some

**[03:54]** really bad stuff, and in particular, Wilbur Waitley, you know right from the beginning

**[04:00]** is not human, something is very off about him, and it just gets worse and worse as the

**[04:06]** story goes on.

**[04:07]** If you haven't read this story, maybe take a break, pause this episode, and go give it

**[04:13]** a read and come back, or listen to it, because there's definitely multiple videos of the

**[04:17]** entirety of it on YouTube, and I've also seen it in podcast form, though I can't remember

**[04:23]** offhand which podcast that was.

**[04:28]** Let's talk about the expansion itself.

**[04:30]** This expansion contains the whole Waitley clan.

**[04:35]** We've got Lavinia Waitley, we've got Wilbur Waitley, her son, we've got Old Wizard Waitley,

**[04:41]** Lavinia's dad, Wilbur's grandfather, we've got Junior Waitley, which spoilers, probably

**[04:47]** read the end of Dunwich Horror, I did tell you to do that if you hadn't done it already,

**[04:51]** and we've also got an independent Great Old One, the Dire Yogg Sototh.

**[04:59]** This is Cthulhu Wars' first clan, that's a new concept.

**[05:03]** Let me read you the exact rules on clans and how they're used.

**[05:09]** Clan is a group of unique beings, which may be of any type, but are added to the game

**[05:12]** as a group.

**[05:14]** In this case, we've got three Cultists and a terror with the Waitleys and Junior.

**[05:20]** How do you recruit people from the clan?

**[05:22]** In the Doom phase, in player order, each faction can choose to recruit one Waitley member.

**[05:28]** To do so, they must pay that Waitley's cost.

**[05:30]** They all cost Power and not Doom in this case.

**[05:34]** If the recruited Waitley is not in play, place it on the map as the new owner wishes.

**[05:40]** You can recruit a Waitley that's already in play.

**[05:43]** In this case, the former owner hands over the relevant loyalty card, but the miniature

**[05:48]** remains in play at its current location.

**[05:51]** That Waitley is now yours until possibly the next Doom phase.

**[05:54]** So I'm going to be doing something a little bit different with this episode.

**[05:58]** Typically, I have had multiple reps in with anything that I've talked about on the podcast.

**[06:05]** In this case, I actually haven't played with the Dunwich Horror expansion at all.

**[06:10]** I have some people in my group trying to get them to play with this expansion, and

**[06:16]** I'm going to try to do a bit of a before and after, a little bit of a time skip, in the

**[06:20]** middle of this episode.

**[06:24]** Right away, that way of recruiting the Waitleys in the Doom phase, that's different from how

**[06:28]** the other neutral, at least the neutral monsters work.

**[06:33]** You can only buy one at a time, that's the same.

**[06:36]** The Waitleys don't cost any Doom, notably, that's important.

**[06:41]** And you can kind of like, steal them out from under somebody in the following Doom phase,

**[06:45]** if you feel like it.

**[06:47]** That is a big wrinkle in how these can work.

**[06:51]** And I think, as I'm doing my initial kind of evaluation of these, I also need to keep

**[06:56]** in mind like, using them in combination with each other, because that seems like a lot

**[07:01]** more of a possibility that that can happen versus like, just playing with a pile of neutrals.

**[07:06]** I'm probably not buying more than two neutral monsters at the absolute most, because they're

**[07:12]** going to cost me two Doom apiece, that's four Doom.

**[07:15]** That's almost one-sixth of my total to win the game, that's a lot.

**[07:20]** These don't cost Doom, they only cost Power.

**[07:22]** And the other thing to keep in mind is, everybody except Junior is also a Cultist, so yes they

**[07:28]** cost Power to buy and to steal from people, but they are also, three of them, are providing

**[07:35]** you with Power during Gather Power, and that's pretty unique, and we shouldn't forget that

**[07:40]** as we start to talk about these.

**[07:44]** Not too much else more to say, I will just get into it starting with our first Cultist.

**[07:51]** She was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying

**[07:55]** to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries

**[07:59]** of Waitleys, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and wormholes.

**[08:05]** She had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that

**[08:09]** old Waitley had taught her.

**[08:12]** The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of old Waitley's reputation for black

**[08:16]** magic, and the unexplained death by violence of Mrs. Waitley when Lavinia was twelve years

**[08:21]** old had not helped make the place popular.

**[08:24]** Isolated among strange influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose daydreams and

**[08:30]** singular occupations, nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home

**[08:36]** from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared.

**[08:41]** Yes, our first clan member to discuss, our first Cultist to discuss is Lavinia Waitley.

**[08:49]** She costs two Power to recruit, and she's got a combat of zero.

**[08:55]** I know in the last episode I said I would credit everybody for their sculpts going forward.

**[08:59]** I actually still don't know who made these because it was not in the crazy super omega

**[09:04]** final rulebook.

**[09:06]** Whoever the individuals were that sculpted these, or person, great job, these are all

**[09:11]** amazing.

**[09:12]** Yeah, Lavinia, she just looks like a pretty normal looking lady.

**[09:18]** Can't tell that she's, in the story she's an albino, she just looks purple here.

**[09:23]** Looks like she's holding some big crystal above her head, that's kind of cool.

**[09:28]** Not wearing a shirt, a little risque here actually, but the wind is blowing just the

**[09:32]** right way, so it's PG-13.

**[09:36]** The ability on Lavinia is Bride of the Old Ones.

**[09:40]** It's an ongoing ability.

**[09:41]** If Lavinia shares an area with any great old one of any faction at the start of an action,

**[09:47]** she's immune to kills, pains, or eliminations until after that action ends.

**[09:53]** She also has a second ability, Mother of Monsters, which is in the doom phase.

**[09:58]** If you control Lavinia, pay half as much Power and or doom for any independent great old

**[10:03]** one, neutral monster, terror, Cultist, or clan member you acquire, rounded up.

**[10:11]** So the first thing that jumps out to me about Lavinia, she does cost only two Power, so

**[10:16]** that's only one more than a normal Cultist, and she is going to be providing you Power.

**[10:20]** herself, that's nice, so pretty cheap. Bride of the Great Old One seems pretty

**[10:26]** nice to me on the surface. It seems like as long as you're hanging out with your

**[10:29]** Great Old One, she can pretty much soak up a kill. Note that it says she's immune

**[10:34]** to kills, it doesn't say like Lavinia can't be assigned a kill, so if she's in

**[10:39]** a battle with your Great Old One and someone rolls exactly one kill, these are

**[10:43]** the only units you have in the area, you can just stick it on Lavinia and your

**[10:46]** Great Old One can survive. That seems pretty handy. I would be careful about

**[10:51]** assigning her a pain though, especially if Madness is in the game. If you end up

**[10:56]** separating her from a Great Old One, she seems kind of unremarkable when she's

**[11:01]** not next to one. Another thing to keep in mind about all these clan members that

**[11:06]** are Cultists, if you don't have monsters or Great Old Ones protecting them, they

**[11:10]** can just be captured, so you really don't want that to happen, especially if you're

**[11:14]** paying a little bit extra for these special Cultists here. The Mother of

**[11:21]** Monsters ability is pretty interesting. I think it makes it a lot easier to get

**[11:26]** more clan members, but also buying neutrals at half the cost seems pretty

**[11:31]** appealing, especially the Doom. It makes it a lot more enticing to buy more

**[11:37]** monsters than you normally would. When I play with this expansion with my group, I

**[11:43]** definitely plan on including a handful of other neutrals too, because I do

**[11:47]** think the gameplay with these is going to be enhanced by having more neutrals

**[11:52]** in the game. If you do have Lavinia already and nobody steals her from you

**[11:59]** in the following Doom phase, buying another clan member at half cost is

**[12:03]** going to be nice too. So yeah, like I said, I'm gonna try to keep in mind buying

**[12:07]** more of these and how they will interact with each other.

**[12:10]** Wilbur only costs 3 Power and Old Man Whately only costs 2 Power, but Junior

**[12:16]** costs 4, so getting Junior at a discount of 2 instead of 4 seems like a great

**[12:22]** deal if you've already got Junior's mom in play. What factions like Lavinia? I

**[12:29]** think this one's just gonna be generally useful. Probably the defensive factions I

**[12:34]** would think get the most mileage out of this. If you're just hunkering down with

**[12:38]** Ubo, Sothla, and you have Lavinia, they're gonna have to try really hard to

**[12:43]** actually kill your Great Old One, because as long as you keep her with Ubo, for

**[12:47]** example, or I don't know, maybe Hastur, as long as they get Payne together and

**[12:51]** they're in the same area, you're gonna have to roll multiple kills to really

**[12:55]** get the job done. Generally useful to all factions, I would say. That's my guess

**[13:00]** anyway. That's all for Lavinia. I'll move on to our next clan member. Old Whately

**[13:09]** drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village and discoursed

**[13:12]** incoherently to a group of loungers at Osborne's General Store. There seemed to

**[13:17]** be a change in the Old Man, an added element of furtiveness in the clouded

**[13:21]** brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear, though he

**[13:26]** was not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all, he

**[13:32]** showed some trace of pride, later noticed in his daughter, and what he said of the

**[13:36]** child's paternity was remembered by many hearers years afterwards. Our second

**[13:44]** Cultist that we have to discuss is Old Man Whately. The sculpt for this one is

**[13:49]** super cool. If you saw the teaser for this expansion from Peterson Games, it

**[13:54]** was kind of the back of this one, facing away. But yeah, looking at the front, you've

**[14:00]** got Old Man Whately sitting in a chair. He looks very much like one game

**[14:05]** designer who designed this game, Sandy Peterson. He's holding a skull, Last Port

**[14:11]** Yorick style. No, not really. It looks a little bit more threatening than that.

**[14:15]** And he's got a big, nasty, crawling, I don't even know, centipede-looking thing

**[14:21]** behind him. It doesn't really have any legs except for two big talon-looking

**[14:26]** claws in front of it. I really like this one. I love the pose that he's given. He's

**[14:30]** just kind of making a menacing, scary old man pose. So this may be my favorite

**[14:35]** one, but I'm sure I'll go back on that multiple times. Old Wizard Whately costs

**[14:41]** two Power to recruit and has a combat of zero. His ability is Clan Patriarch. This

**[14:47]** is the Recruit Cultist action. When you recruit a Cultist in Wizard Whately's

**[14:52]** area, it costs one fewer Power. That means a zero-cost Cultist gains you one Power.

**[14:58]** He also has another ability, Magician. It's a pre-battle. If Wizard Whately is

**[15:03]** involved in the battle, you can immediately muster an independent Great

**[15:07]** Old One, Neutral Monster, Terror, Cultist, or Clan Member as if it were the Doom

**[15:12]** phase, as long as other requirements are met. You pay normal costs unless you

**[15:18]** control Lavinia. So the first ability, Clan Patriarch, I'm rereading the rules

**[15:25]** on recruiting the Whatleys. We're in the Doom phase. You're not taking action, so I

**[15:30]** don't believe you're recruiting Lavinia, for example, for one fewer Power. However,

**[15:36]** if you have any Cultists in your pool for whatever reason, they got captured,

**[15:40]** maybe it's another Clan Member that got captured, when you go to recruit them

**[15:44]** again, they are getting the discount. So your normal acolytes of one cost, they

**[15:50]** now cost zero Power to recruit. That seems amazing to me. There's also a line

**[15:56]** about zero-cost Cultists. The only ones I know of here are Brain Cylinders. I'm not

**[16:01]** totally sure what's going on with that line in text, but if somebody does know,

**[16:04]** write me in. Not totally sure about the zero-cost offhand. Second ability,

**[16:11]** Magician, seems pretty spicy. It's using this word, muster, which we've not seen

**[16:17]** before in this game. I'm assuming this is just kind of a catch-all for the

**[16:21]** different methods of getting any of these things, like neutral monsters, you're

**[16:24]** summoning them. Clan Members, you're recruiting them. Neutral Great Old Ones,

**[16:29]** you're awakening them. Just a catch-all for all those different things. So yeah,

**[16:34]** this is a really nice way of getting things out of the pool and into play

**[16:39]** outside of the doom phase. I think that's actually very Powerful, especially if

**[16:43]** there's a bunch of neutrals in the pool. Your opponents are not gonna really know

**[16:48]** until they battle you which one you're gonna grab, so I like the

**[16:52]** uncertainty around this one. I also think this ability becomes extremely dangerous

**[16:57]** if you also happen to have Lavinia because of that Mother of Monsters

**[17:01]** ability. Not only will you get to grab something out of the pool, but you're

**[17:05]** gonna be paying half as much for it, which is pretty spicy. Most Neutral Great

**[17:11]** Old Ones cost, on average, four Power. You're getting that maybe for two. Getting a

**[17:17]** terror or a monster, maybe for one doom and one Power as a pre-battle, that seems

**[17:23]** incredibly Powerful. What factions are gonna like Old Wizard Waitly? Again,

**[17:31]** seems like all pretty nice ability. I mean, the Clan Patriarch, if you're not

**[17:36]** playing with other neutrals, I think that's still generally useful. Maybe

**[17:40]** nicer in factions that tend to put Cultists in their pool, like Black Goat

**[17:45]** comes to mind. Maybe a Great Cthulhu who might be devolving their Cultists into

**[17:49]** Deep Ones. Notably, I don't believe this works with Demon Salt and Psychosis

**[17:55]** ability because it's not a recruit action. Also, you can only do it in areas

**[18:00]** without other units, and you need to have Wizard Waitly in the area that

**[18:04]** you're planning to recruit in. I'm looking forward to seeing this one in

**[18:09]** play. I'm definitely gonna have some spicy neutrals to include because I

**[18:13]** really want to see them pop up by surprise. Can you imagine Elder

**[18:18]** Things showing up in the pre-battle? That seems disgusting and like a disaster for

**[18:23]** anybody that's trying to plan an attack. If they don't know if that's gonna come

**[18:26]** or not, that seems very fun and chaotic.

**[18:31]** All right, let's move on to our third clan member.

**[18:36]** Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his

**[18:41]** one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondents to many librarians in

**[18:45]** distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept. He was more

**[18:51]** and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because of certain youthful

**[18:55]** disappearances, which suspicion laid vaguely at his door, but was always able

**[19:00]** to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of old-time

**[19:04]** gold, which still, as in his grandfather's time, went forth regularly and

**[19:09]** increasingly for cattle buying. He was now tremendously mature of aspect, and

**[19:14]** his height, having reached the normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax

**[19:19]** beyond that figure. In 1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic

**[19:25]** University called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully

**[19:29]** six and three-quarters feet tall.

**[19:33]** Yes, our third clan member is Wilbur Waitley. They did a great job on the

**[19:40]** sculpt. He's got a big kind of overcoat on type of thing that you would maybe

**[19:46]** stack a bunch of little kids together in and then be in disguise. He's just all

**[19:49]** one guy. He's covering up the fact that his legs have turned into, yikes, some

**[19:56]** hooves. He's got kind of big wide arms. They don't really look human anymore. He

**[20:02]** looks totally adult in the face, got a full beard, but yeah, downstairs it is not

**[20:07]** looking very human. They did a really good job of taking the one part in the

**[20:12]** story where Wilbur goes to Miskatonic to consult the Necronomicon. Some shit

**[20:19]** happens, he gets attacked by a dog, and the description of his body afterwards, I

**[20:23]** pictured this looking a lot like what happens there. Wilbur's a three-cost

**[20:29]** Cultist with a combat of zero. His ability is Yr-Ngm-Grr. I'm gonna

**[20:35]** call it YNN from here on out, just like I did in the library episode. I have a hard

**[20:39]** time

**[20:40]** pronouncing that. In the Doom phase, if Wilbur is in play, when you perform a Ritual of Annihilation,

**[20:46]** place a Gate from the pool on Wilbur's loyalty card. These Gates remain even when Wilbur

**[20:53]** switches loyalty. He also has another ability, Open the Way. It's a zero-cost action. Take a

**[20:59]** Gate from Wilbur's loyalty card and place it anywhere on the map. This seems like one of the

**[21:05]** weirder units in this expansion. You get a Gate, but only once you ritual. So maybe if you were

**[21:14]** going to ritual anyways and they're still kind of cheap, YNN's pretty nice. The thing that I would

**[21:20]** caution you over, and that I'll certainly be watching for, is be careful of the turn order.

**[21:26]** Notably, these cannot change hands multiple times in the same Doom phase, so that's nice,

**[21:31]** but you gotta be careful next turn. If somebody else goes before you,

**[21:36]** they might be able to buy Wilbur before you get a chance to use Open the Way to put a Gate down.

**[21:44]** I'm thinking if you can do a five or six cost ritual and then, like, during the action phase,

**[21:49]** put that Gate down, that's probably where you want to be. You figure you saved three Power

**[21:54]** building a Gate anyway, and you get to walk in place for a turn. That might be enough to make

**[21:59]** it worth it, but this one's pretty odd. I definitely want to see this one in play. I'll

**[22:05]** certainly be trying to make use of the Open the Way ability myself, because I think that one's

**[22:09]** pretty spicy and interesting. You can place it anywhere on the map, not just where you have

**[22:14]** units. I don't know why you would want to donate this Gate to other people, but you could if you

**[22:19]** wanted to use some diplomacy that way. What factions like Wilbur? It's a little tricky

**[22:27]** to evaluate this one. I'd say probably Opener, maybe, because you can get the Gates out, but

**[22:33]** Opener also might not want a ritual necessarily early on. Tough call. Probably the doom-loving

**[22:41]** factions like the Cho-Cho or the Yellow Sign might like this. They were going to ritual anyway.

**[22:47]** They probably don't mind getting a bonus Gate out of it, even if the ritual was kind of expensive

**[22:52]** to begin with. Gotta watch for this one. Not sure how this one will actually play out in practice.

**[22:58]** On paper, it seems a little weird, a little fiddly to get it to work correctly.

**[23:06]** Let's move on to our last clan member.

**[23:11]** It was mostly a kind of force that doesn't belong in our part of space, a kind of force that acts

**[23:16]** and grows and shapes itself by other laws than those of our sort of nature. We have no business

**[23:22]** calling in such things from outside, and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to.

**[23:29]** There was some of it in Wilbur Whateley himself, enough to make a devil and a precocious monster

**[23:34]** of him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight. I'm going to burn his accursed

**[23:39]** diary. If you men are wise, you'll dynamite that altar stone up there and pull down all the rings

**[23:45]** of standing stones on the other hills. Things like that brought down the beings those Whateleys

**[23:50]** were so fond of, the beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race

**[23:55]** and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purpose. But as to this thing we've

**[24:02]** just sent back, the Whateleys raised it for a terrible part in the doings that were to come.

**[24:07]** It grew fast and big from the same reason that Wilbur grew fast and big, but it beat him because

**[24:12]** it had a greater share of the outsideness in it. You needn't ask how Wilbur called it out of the

**[24:17]** air. He didn't call it out. It was his twin brother, but it looked more like the father than he did.

**[24:26]** Our last clan member to discuss is Junior Whateley.

**[24:30]** He's a terror, he costs four Power to recruit, and he has a combat of four.

**[24:36]** This one looks pretty disgusting. They did a great job getting the outsideness across here.

**[24:44]** Only a vaguely human face, but otherwise just many, far too many legs to be comfortable with.

**[24:52]** A big nasty back. It looks like a ton of like barnacles on the back. Big gaping mouth. There's

**[25:01]** even like a second face coming out of the head here, and even another eye,

**[25:07]** several eyes on the face. This one is very disturbing looking and creepy. Definitely

**[25:13]** makes me think of the Dunwich Horror here, and makes me glad that in the story it was

**[25:18]** mostly invisible most of the time. The ability on Junior is growth in the doom phase. If Junior

**[25:26]** is in play, place any loyalty token on his loyalty card. Maybe I would use a d6 or something. These

**[25:32]** remain even when Junior switches loyalty. He also has another ability, transmogrification,

**[25:39]** zero cost action. If Junior has at least one token on him, roll a die. If the roll is equal

**[25:45]** to or less than the number of tokens on Junior's loyalty card, replace Junior with any great old

**[25:50]** one, neutral or faction, ignoring all awakening requirements, including cost. Place Junior back

**[25:57]** in the pool. Whether or not you succeed, discard one token on Junior's loyalty card.

**[26:03]** If you recruit a rival's great old one in this way, it remains under their control.

**[26:09]** So this is the weirdest clan member to me. He's a terror, notably the other ones are Cultists, so

**[26:15]** Junior is not providing you Power in the gather Power phase. He is a terror though,

**[26:19]** so he's immune to a lot of Spellbooks that target monsters. He doesn't grow until after you recruit

**[26:26]** him, so I'd maybe want to do that earlier rather than later if you're planning on using this.

**[26:32]** You figure a game of Cthulhu Wars probably goes like maybe five or six doom phases, so you're

**[26:38]** gonna get maybe five or six maximum on that transmogrification ability. Seems like a bit of a

**[26:44]** risk-reward thing going on here. Seems to work a little bit like a desecration, but if you fail

**[26:50]** you don't really get anything and you also lose a counter of growth, so I don't know. I kind of

**[26:57]** really don't want to use this until I have at least three, like a 50% shot of getting something.

**[27:03]** That being said, it could be pretty nice to be able to get like Narlathotep for example

**[27:09]** on the cheap. You paid four for Junior and then you're able to like zero cost get Narlathotep out.

**[27:15]** That seems pretty nice, especially if you end up getting

**[27:19]** unlimited combat. You could maybe like fight and then transmogrify.

**[27:25]** Would factions like this one? I'm really not sure. I would say the factions with the most

**[27:31]** expensive great old ones like this the most, but yeah it's like a big commitment to go into this

**[27:37]** one. It doesn't have another ability to kind of like level it out and make it super useful.

**[27:43]** I don't know. The neutral great old ones, if you start replacing this with a great old one from the

**[27:49]** pool, a neutral great old one, they also cost four on average, so if you don't have a lot of them in the

**[27:55]** pool I don't think it's going to be super hard to predict what Junior is going to transmogrify into

**[28:01]** and then you're walking in place for one turn, but I don't know if you're really getting a lot of

**[28:06]** advantage out of this one. Though I will say four cost four combat is a pretty good rate and he

**[28:12]** probably fights pretty well on top of being immune to like invisibility, devour, etc.

**[28:19]** I'll have to see this one on the table because I'm a little unsure of how good this one is.

**[28:27]** Now let's move on to our last unit in this expansion is not a clan member.

**[28:37]** Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the old ones broke through of old

**[28:44]** and where they shall break through again. He knows where they have trod earth's fields

**[28:48]** and where they still tread them and why no one can behold them as they tread.

**[28:54]** Our last unit in this expansion we have Dire Yog-Sothoth. This one is just a triumph of

**[29:02]** sculpting. All of these are probably the most detailed sculpts that we've seen in the game so

**[29:07]** far and wow. I know I just said in the opener episode that those were the most disgusting units

**[29:13]** and whoever sculpted this you really outdid yourself. Somehow you've made something even

**[29:19]** more gross to look at than Yog. I don't even know how to describe this. I guess it looks

**[29:24]** vaguely bug-like but wow there's so many tentacles toward the bottom and it's just like a gross kind

**[29:30]** of bending. It looks like it's got all kind of muscles and tendons and bubbles and clawed

**[29:38]** insectile looking arms. It's got a really disgusting head with plenty of other bulbous

**[29:45]** like tumor looking things that the original Yog has. There's plenty of eyes on here.

**[29:51]** It's terrifying to look at.

**[29:53]** How to awaken Dire Yog. It costs six Power to awaken. For Opener of the Way you must have a

**[30:00]** spawn of Yog-Sothoth on the map. You'll pay six Power and replace the spawn with Dire Yog.

**[30:06]** This counts as awakening regular Yog-Sothoth if you haven't already done so and each other player

**[30:13]** gains one Elder Sign. For everyone else you must have a great old one in play as well as your most

**[30:20]** great old one in play as well as your most expensive monster or terror.

**[30:24]** You're going to pay 10 Power minus the cost of your unit and you're going to replace it with

**[30:29]** Dire Yog-Sothoth. The combat for this unit is equal to the number of enemy controlled

**[30:35]** great old ones in play. The ability on this unit is called to rule them all. It's a four cost action.

**[30:43]** Dire Yog-Sothoth can capture other great old ones following the same rules as capture Cultist.

**[30:50]** Wow so this one is pretty wild. You can capture other great old ones

**[30:57]** which we've never seen something like that before.

**[31:00]** that's pretty insane. Costs 4 Power to do that, but wow, if you can do it and capture something

**[31:07]** that costs more than a few Power, oof, that seems devastating to whoever is on the receiving end.

**[31:15]** This reminds me of the neutrals in the massive Narlathotep expansion. Crawling Chaos can recruit

**[31:22]** them in a bit of a different way than the other factions, so I like that, that's cool.

**[31:26]** Notably, the combat here, half as much as regular Yogg, so this is not going to roll a lot of dice,

**[31:32]** though maybe if you're in a higher player count game, you might be able to do such a thing. I'm

**[31:37]** looking for Demon Sultan and Windwalker, hopefully are in the same game, and maybe I'm rolling more

**[31:42]** than five dice with this. Spellbook requirement for this Great Old One. Your Great Old One is

**[31:49]** in the same area as two enemy Great Old Ones. That seems pretty tricky to manage,

**[31:57]** but maybe you're playing with Windwalker, Yellow Sign, Demon Sultan, hopefully you're playing with

**[32:03]** neutrals too. If that's the case, I think you can maybe pull this off, but in a game with not

**[32:08]** many other Great Old Ones, it might be kind of tricky to actually earn the Spellbook with this

**[32:14]** unit. But I think that's worth doing. The Spellbook is called It Walks Unseen. It's a

**[32:19]** move action. Whenever you move any other units, you may also move Dire Yogg at no additional cost.

**[32:27]** I think that's a very scary ability if you can get the opportunity, especially once you have

**[32:32]** unlimited combat. The Spellbook reminds me a bit of Nyogtha, if you remember from our other episode.

**[32:39]** You're just saving Power every time you move something else. I've said many other times it's

**[32:44]** really nice to have some shields, some meat shields, whenever you move your Great Old One into

**[32:49]** a dangerous area. And Yogg is going to be moving around for free, so it should be a little more

**[32:54]** cheap to move in. You're really coming for other people's Great Old Ones with this one.

**[33:01]** Battling is kind of not even important. You really want to capture them. I think in general,

**[33:06]** people are going to knee-jerk battle you away if they can help it. I don't know, I'm thinking the

**[33:13]** best use for this is like, you have unlimited combat, you fight with an unlimited battle right

**[33:19]** away, and you paint yourself into an area with an enemy Great Old One. That's when you use your

**[33:24]** normal action for the turn and you take that to rule them all action and capture their Great Old

**[33:29]** One right then and there before they can react. This one seems very fun. I definitely want to see

**[33:36]** this on the table. It seems like it could bring out some salt capturing other people's Great Old

**[33:40]** Ones, but I'm kind of here for it. I really want to just munch on some Demon, Salt, and Avatars with

**[33:46]** this and see them cry. That's all that I have. That's all the recording gram has for now. Hopefully

**[33:54]** there is a time skip and hopefully some time's passed and I've played with this expansion and

**[34:00]** I can give you my reaction after playing with it for the first time. See you soon. Bye.

**[34:14]** Hi, it's me again. I'm back. It's a couple weeks after the initial recording of the episode,

**[34:22]** and happy to say I have played a game with Dunwich Horror at this point.

**[34:26]** And yeah, I will tell you a bit about it. We got together for a four-player game,

**[34:31]** decided to just play on Earth, and we're using the original four factions, so Cthulhu, Yellow Sign,

**[34:37]** Black Goat, Crawling Chaos, and just had the Dunwich Horror by themselves. So that was the

**[34:43]** game. It ended up being a very close game. Crawling Chaos ended up winning with 35 doom,

**[34:48]** Cthulhu right behind them with 34, and I as Black Goat and my friend Maggie as Yellow Sign

**[34:55]** bringing up the back of the pack, but we were also at 31, so it was a pretty tight game.

**[35:01]** How did the Dunwich units themselves do in the game? The ones that we saw,

**[35:05]** I thought they all were pretty impactful. Unfortunately, poor Wilbur never got drafted,

**[35:12]** so we didn't really get to see him do his thing, but I had Lavinia hanging out in West Africa,

**[35:18]** pretty much making Shub untouchable for most of the game, or at least not without a lot of fighting.

**[35:23]** That was pretty nice. I also had recruited Junior, who was growing for me most of the game,

**[35:32]** hoping I could hatch him maybe into a replacement Shub if I needed to, but it never actually ended

**[35:38]** up coming up during the game, thankfully. One thing I will say, I was very scared of getting

**[35:44]** that one stolen basically every doom phase as soon as I got it. If you have Junior, probably

**[35:50]** you always want to have a bunch of other units that you also own in the same Gated area that

**[35:56]** Junior might be in. We don't want us to have somebody by Junior when he's at one of your Gates

**[36:02]** and you might have just a wimpy, in my case maybe a Ghoul or something hanging around and that's the

**[36:06]** only other thing you have. Make sure whatever Gate you have with Junior is well defended in

**[36:11]** case he does switch sides on you. The main star of the show in the game we played I would say

**[36:19]** was probably Old Wizard Waitly. I think I already speculated that might be the most overtly Powerful

**[36:24]** one and I definitely think it was on display there. Cthulhu was making great use of devolving

**[36:31]** and then using Old Wizard Waitly to zero cost recruit, even doing a little bit of shotgunning

**[36:38]** with Absorb and replacing the acolytes on the cheap. Having those extra zero cost actions on

**[36:45]** top of submerged stalling made sure Cthulhu was pretty much the main threat the entire game.

**[36:51]** Very scary. I was a little jealous. I honestly wanted Wizard Waitly for myself because I was

**[36:56]** picturing with Black Goat doing some really nasty early on get Wizard Waitly, sacrifice a bunch of

**[37:03]** your Cultists to do things and bring them back maybe next time. Dire Yogg also ended up not

**[37:11]** making an appearance in the game but not because nobody wanted them. In fact everybody wanted Dire

**[37:17]** Yogg. Everyone was constantly discussing, I'm sure internally to themselves, how and when they were

**[37:23]** going to maybe get it but the game was such a tight one that nobody could really justify the

**[37:29]** like seven or eight Power they would have needed to spend to get Dire Yogg so it never ended up

**[37:34]** happening. I suppose I could have maybe tried to hatch Junior into Dire Yogg as well but I got

**[37:42]** Junior pretty early on. I only ended up having like three growth counters on by the end of the

**[37:46]** game so I was still a little skeptical of my chances to actually pop into another great old

**[37:54]** one but maybe it will happen in another game. All the abilities aside, I would say just having

**[38:03]** access to an extra Cultist that can generate Power for you and control Gate for you potentially

**[38:09]** is just a very good thing to have in general so yeah I would if you're playing with Dunwich Hoar

**[38:16]** highly prioritize the three human Cultists units specifically. Even if you're not using their

**[38:24]** abilities like they're just very good. Two Power for Lavinia or Wizard Waitly is an absolute steal.

**[38:31]** Even if they didn't have any other abilities just think about two gather Power phases if

**[38:35]** they're under your control. They've paid for themselves and yeah that's not counting their

**[38:40]** abilities which are very very impactful and can also help you drive the game forward.

**[38:48]** Overall I'm pretty excited about this one. Excited to use it again I think with some other neutral

**[38:54]** units to take full advantage of the abilities. We only had time to play one game but in the future I

**[38:59]** definitely plan to try these again with even more neutrals in the pool so that we can fully see what

**[39:06]** these units are capable of. Another positive thing I had to say about this would be the complexity

**[39:13]** was kind of a bit on the lower side actually. I was pleasantly surprised that these felt a bit

**[39:19]** more like the High Priest expansion in practice. That's a good thing. Extra Cultists are good. They

**[39:26]** kind of accelerate your game plan a little bit and these ones have like a bit of a twist on them.

**[39:31]** They can get captured. They're not like High Priest can just kind of evaporate if you ever

**[39:36]** were to come capture them. These cannot do that so that was very interesting too. I think

**[39:42]** there was a lot less switching of control than I thought there would be and it makes sense if you

**[39:47]** have a big pile of your own units and then there's a Cultist buried in there like unlikely somebody's

**[39:52]** going to buy it out from under you because you'll probably just capture it. One other thing on the

**[39:57]** Cultists controlling Gates. Cthulhu had to do this at one point like have old wizard Waitley

**[40:04]** control a Gate at the end of the action phase and that actually was very impactful in the game

**[40:11]** because when the doom phase rolled around Yellow Sign was able to buy old man Waitley before they

**[40:18]** ritualed. So they end up getting an extra Gate and an extra point of doom of all for three Power

**[40:24]** that seems like a pretty good deal. Just getting the one extra doom it really did matter at the

**[40:29]** end of the game. I think that's all I have to say. I'm kind of rambling a little bit but yeah I will

**[40:35]** cut this episode short there. Thanks very much for listening. Please rate, review, and subscribe if
