## Transcript

**[00:00]** The scene before them was like some frozen world of the outer void.

**[00:07]** Vast, unbroken, save for a few scattered mounds and ridges, the plain extended to the white horizon and its armored peaks.

**[00:15]** Nothing seemed to live or move on the awful glistening vistas whose nearer levels were swept clean of snow.

**[00:22]** The sun appeared to grow pale and chill and to recede behind the adventurers, and the wind blew upon them from the ice,

**[00:28]** like a breath from abysses beyond the pole.

**[00:46]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:52]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[00:55]** Hope you're doing well. At the time of recording, it's December 22nd.

**[01:01]** I'm trying to sneak in another episode before I hopefully publish them at the end of the month.

**[01:06]** Started my small break from work. I'm off for five days, so I'm very excited about that.

**[01:12]** Just taking it easy today, thought I would record an episode.

**[01:15]** I've just had some hot chocolate with some homemade marshmallows.

**[01:19]** Highly recommend. If you are interested in making them, they're not that difficult.

**[01:23]** They do smell awful when they are hot, so you've been warned.

**[01:29]** Smells like death. Tastes really good.

**[01:31]** We used vanilla bean, so these have a nice aftertaste of vanilla that I really, really enjoy.

**[01:36]** Today, I want to bring you another map-specific episode.

**[01:43]** Actually, the last one that we have to cover.

**[01:45]** This is on the Primeval Earth map.

**[01:49]** Very cool concept. It's like Earth, but old.

**[01:53]** Ancient Earth.

**[01:53]** So think like kind of a Pangaea vibe, or if you've read any of the Hyperborea stories by Clark Ashton Smith.

**[02:02]** It's more like Ancient Earth is Hyperborea.

**[02:04]** They've labeled a lot of the continents from Hyperborea, and there's a lot of fun ones that stand out.

**[02:10]** I mean, Atlantis is on this map. That's kind of cool.

**[02:13]** But yeah, if you've read a lot of the Clark Ashton Smith stories, there's other ones that will stick out as well.

**[02:17]** Mew, Lemuria, Hyperborea itself is on there.

**[02:23]** The layout of the continents is sort of unrecognizable from Earth.

**[02:26]** It looks like there's four main ones, kind of a big strip of land in the center of the map,

**[02:32]** and then something sort of where South America would be, something sort of where North America would be,

**[02:38]** and then sort of in the Australia area on Earth, there's another continent here.

**[02:43]** The other thing you'll notice looking at this map is there are a number of icons, glacier, glyphs that look like pieces of ice,

**[02:53]** and I'll get right into why that is there.

**[02:57]** Basically, the gimmick on this map is that areas start getting frozen over as you play,

**[03:02]** and that does have some effects on controlling Gates and ultimately changes the flow of the game quite a bit.

**[03:09]** So I'll get into the rules proper here.

**[03:11]** During the setup, just like any other four-player map, I'm going to assume you're playing a four-player game,

**[03:18]** this map has some different configurations.

**[03:21]** So one has nine glacier glyphs and the other has 11.

**[03:24]** So if you want to, you can have a game that's more or less icy, and that will make more sense later.

**[03:30]** So at the end of the first Doom phase, after everyone's had a chance to perform rituals and stuff,

**[03:37]** you place a glacier token in each player's start area, whether or not it contains a glacier glyph.

**[03:44]** Then, if you have any controlling units, remove them from those Gates, they stay in their areas, they just step off the Gate,

**[03:50]** and replace them by placing a glacier onto each of those Gates.

**[03:56]** And there's a little note here for Windwalker specifically,

**[03:59]** only add a glacier in the area where Windwalker actually started.

**[04:02]** Do not place one on Windwalker's other vacant start area.

**[04:05]** So we freeze some stuff over in the first Doom phase, and then on all subsequent Doom phases,

**[04:12]** at the end of the Doom phase, again, after everyone's gotten their Doom, done their rituals, done all their effects,

**[04:18]** the first player, so the person who has the most Power,

**[04:21]** must select two areas on the map that have the glacier glyph.

**[04:25]** These areas can't already have glaciers in them,

**[04:27]** and then that player's going to place a glacier in each of those two areas.

**[04:31]** The glaciers are going to look familiar to you.

**[04:33]** If you've seen Windwalker, it's the same glacier, sculpted by Tidal 4, I believe.

**[04:39]** These ones are kind of turquoise and translucent, pretty cool looking.

**[04:43]** So the first player's going to place two more glaciers, and then the same rules apply.

**[04:47]** If there's a Gate in a selected area, the glacier goes on top of that Gate.

**[04:51]** Any unit that's controlling it remains in the area, but is set aside, so it's no longer controlling the Gate.

**[04:56]** And then lastly, on Chaos Gates, if there's a Chaos Gate in a selected area,

**[05:01]** exchange the Chaos Gate with a normal Gate, and place the glacier on top of the Gate,

**[05:05]** and then displace the controlling unit as normal.

**[05:10]** Once every area with a glacier glyph on this map possesses a glacier,

**[05:14]** no more glaciers need to be placed, and we can skip this part of the Doom phase.

**[05:18]** The remaining areas are safe.

**[05:20]** And then there's one more note on here for Opener of the Way.

**[05:25]** Yogg can never be covered by a glacier, it makes sense.

**[05:27]** It would be a rule's nightmare.

**[05:29]** This is true even if Yogg is in an area with a glacier glyph,

**[05:32]** and that area is selected during the Doom phase.

**[05:34]** So no worries, opener players.

**[05:37]** No brains being broken there.

**[05:38]** Basically, as you play on the Primeval map, as you get further into the game,

**[05:46]** the board is getting more and more iced over,

**[05:48]** and there are less and less areas where one can safely build a Gate.

**[05:54]** Not that it's not safe to build a Gate anywhere,

**[05:56]** but you're going to only have control over a Gate,

**[05:59]** likely for maybe one turn, because of the way the Doom phase thing works.

**[06:03]** If there's any way for you to become the first player,

**[06:08]** probably do that, because you have control over

**[06:11]** where those glaciers are going to be placed, if you are.

**[06:16]** Let's discuss the effects of the glaciers a little bit.

**[06:19]** As we've said, we can't control a Gate where there's a glacier,

**[06:22]** so those are going to be treated as abandoned Gates as the game goes on.

**[06:27]** That means, right from the get-go,

**[06:29]** with a four-player game after the first Doom phase,

**[06:31]** there's going to be four abandoned Gates.

**[06:33]** So the subsequent gather Power phase,

**[06:35]** there's going to be at least four abandoned Gates on the map,

**[06:37]** and that's plus four Power for every player.

**[06:41]** Once placed, the glaciers are permanent.

**[06:43]** That's important.

**[06:44]** It can never be moved or removed from the map.

**[06:46]** If someone ever creates a Gate in an area that already contains a glacier,

**[06:50]** the glacier immediately gets placed on top of the new Gate.

**[06:53]** The unit that created the Gate never gets a chance to control it.

**[06:57]** That's kind of awkward.

**[06:58]** One thing I will note, though, Gates can still be moved out of areas with glaciers on them,

**[07:06]** so that's something very nice for Opener of the Way.

**[07:09]** Last thing to mention is this is just a Power-rich map because of this whole glacier mechanic.

**[07:17]** Assuming people build maybe multiple Gates and those all get frozen over,

**[07:22]** you could be getting as much as like eight Power.

**[07:24]** I'm not sure how much I've seen on this map in total,

**[07:28]** but I've definitely seen like at least eight Power.

**[07:31]** I've played a five-player, six-player game on this map before,

**[07:33]** and there was a lot of Power just being gained from those abandoned Gates.

**[07:39]** And that's actually it for the rules.

**[07:41]** I think this is one of the most simple maps in the game,

**[07:44]** and that's like definitely a point in its favor.

**[07:46]** So now I'll go into some general kind of like strats for primeval and observations.

**[07:54]** I've played on this map a handful of times, so I have a few things to say here.

**[07:58]** First thing, those areas without the glacier glyphs.

**[08:01]** Obviously, building Gates there is good because you won't end up losing control of it later.

**[08:07]** It will be a source of doom for you,

**[08:09]** and you do want to get as much doom as possible on this map,

**[08:12]** given that there's going to be kind of less available areas with Gates.

**[08:16]** Having said that, your opponents are going to want these areas,

**[08:21]** so if you invest in building a Gate in an area without a glacier glyph,

**[08:25]** be prepared.

**[08:26]** People are definitely going to battle you and like lay siege to the area

**[08:29]** because the doom is just so precious on this map.

**[08:33]** Every Gate counts.

**[08:34]** You will be fighting like prolonged battles,

**[08:37]** hopefully not against multiple players, but it might come to that.

**[08:40]** And remember, everyone's going to have more Power to fight such battles.

**[08:43]** So be very careful when investing in building a Gate somewhere where there's not a glacier glyph.

**[08:52]** Second piece of advice,

**[08:54]** it's true for every game of Cthulhu Wars.

**[08:56]** Spending your Power slowly is a good thing,

**[08:58]** even when people have a lot more of it.

**[09:00]** Anybody who's going hard into like,

**[09:02]** maybe building those Gates or recklessly spending their Power,

**[09:05]** they're falling victim to the same trap that other players fall victim to,

**[09:08]** even on Earth.

**[09:09]** The players that spend their Power the slowest,

**[09:12]** if everyone has kind of equal in Power,

**[09:14]** those players are going to have opportunities to like claim Gates,

**[09:18]** steal Gates,

**[09:18]** fight battles,

**[09:19]** all that stuff.

**[09:22]** Another thing to mention,

**[09:23]** when the doom phase does come around,

**[09:25]** you are going to have all this extra Power.

**[09:27]** I would suggest ritualing more often than not,

**[09:30]** because they're just going to be so cheap,

**[09:32]** and you might already have your normal amount of Power anyway.

**[09:34]** You'll notice that happening,

**[09:36]** at least I have in my plays of this map,

**[09:39]** that rituals are pretty common,

**[09:41]** because people are not always willing to build the extra Gates,

**[09:44]** and if they're going to be on one Gate,

**[09:46]** they want to get the extra doom somehow,

**[09:48]** and rituals are the way to do that,

**[09:49]** buying them.

**[09:50]** And everyone's not going to have a very hard time buying them,

**[09:53]** with all the extra Power from the abandoned Gates.

**[09:54]** Last general piece of advice for this map,

**[10:00]** would be like plan for the end game.

**[10:02]** On paper,

**[10:03]** this map sounds to me kind of miserable,

**[10:06]** like people are not going to be gaining much doom every turn,

**[10:09]** everyone's just going to have a bunch of Power to like punch each other in the face,

**[10:12]** and do king of the hill over several areas,

**[10:14]** that don't have the glacier glyphs.

**[10:17]** Yes,

**[10:17]** that is going to happen,

**[10:18]** but also,

**[10:19]** people are going to be ritualing,

**[10:21]** and in my experience,

**[10:22]** this map leads to instant death,

**[10:24]** more often than anywhere else.

**[10:27]** Be ready for that,

**[10:28]** be ready for the game to be over,

**[10:29]** before you actually get to 30 doom,

**[10:31]** because people are going to be doing those rituals,

**[10:34]** and getting that track all the way up to the end.

**[10:39]** That's the general stuff on this map,

**[10:41]** I'll talk a little bit more faction specific stuff now.

**[10:44]** First thing,

**[10:45]** I think this map,

**[10:46]** because of the rituals being more common,

**[10:48]** I think it definitely benefits factions with multiple great old ones,

**[10:51]** just because you will be getting the extra Elder Signs from controlling them.

**[10:55]** That's definitely something to keep in mind,

**[10:57]** so factions with only one great old one,

**[10:59]** sorry,

**[11:00]** you can still do well on this map,

**[11:01]** but I'm definitely thinking that the factions with multiple great old ones are a favorite there.

**[11:05]** I mentioned a little bit earlier,

**[11:09]** but yeah,

**[11:10]** like usual with most of these alternate maps,

**[11:12]** I think opener is a big winner here.

**[11:14]** Players are basically forced to build more Gates,

**[11:17]** that's going to really help you out,

**[11:18]** earning your Spellbook requirements,

**[11:20]** and then yeah,

**[11:20]** as I said earlier,

**[11:21]** beyond one,

**[11:22]** you can use to like actually move Gates that have been frozen over,

**[11:26]** leaving the glacier behind,

**[11:28]** and then moving to an area that's not frozen over,

**[11:30]** that's very nice for opener to be able to do that.

**[11:32]** Windwalker is absolutely hilarious on this map,

**[11:37]** hibernation is absurd on this map,

**[11:40]** this is the most Power I've ever seen in a game of Cthulhu Wars,

**[11:43]** was with my wife playing Windwalker,

**[11:46]** I think she had 33 Power at some point,

**[11:49]** which is just obscene,

**[11:51]** and was able to easily beat down everybody else,

**[11:55]** even after a ritual,

**[11:56]** had no issue winning the game.

**[11:58]** I think Windwalker is one of the strongest factions on this map for that reason.

**[12:01]** I'll also give Demon Sultan a bit of a shout out here,

**[12:06]** with the chaos Gates,

**[12:08]** recall when I was going through the rules,

**[12:10]** after the glaciers get placed on the chaos Gate,

**[12:12]** which is after the doom phase,

**[12:14]** after you've already gotten your Power and doom from them,

**[12:17]** they still get replaced with a normal Gate,

**[12:19]** so like kind of later than normal,

**[12:21]** normally when you have a abandoned chaos Gate,

**[12:23]** it gets replaced in gather Power,

**[12:26]** and nobody's going to get doomed from it.

**[12:27]** In this case,

**[12:28]** Demon Sultan is going to be able to build Gates on the cheap,

**[12:30]** they will get frozen over,

**[12:32]** but you will get the chaos Gates back in your pool,

**[12:34]** and you will still get all the doom that you wanted to get out of them in the first place.

**[12:38]** That's pretty nice.

**[12:41]** Another faction I think is a huge winner on this map is the cats.

**[12:44]** I've actually not played them here,

**[12:46]** but just knowing what I know about the cats,

**[12:48]** they don't care about Gates at all,

**[12:50]** so that's great for them.

**[12:51]** They don't need to care about the glaciers whatsoever.

**[12:53]** Plus, they're just going to benefit from the extra Power that everybody is getting.

**[12:59]** Cats just want the Power so they can get more cats,

**[13:01]** and more cats is more Power,

**[13:03]** and yeah, just getting in a position to do that requires attention ritual is going to be not that bad.

**[13:09]** And yeah, I think that's actually what we have for this map.

**[13:14]** It's going to be a pretty quick episode.

**[13:16]** That was my intent.

**[13:17]** I didn't have a lot of time at the end of the month to do podcast stuff,

**[13:20]** so hopefully it takes me not too long to edit this and get it out to the people.

**[13:25]** I'll give you my closing thoughts.

**[13:29]** This map has, in my opinion, one great thing going for it,

**[13:33]** which is it's definitely the most simple of all of the alternate maps,

**[13:37]** like the most easy to kind of run the map.

**[13:40]** There's not a lot of mental overhead.

**[13:42]** I think you could easily play two games on Primeval in one night if you wanted to.

**[13:47]** It's just not a lot of extra rules,

**[13:49]** and so I think that's a huge benefit.

**[13:51]** It's not personally my favorite map.

**[13:53]** It's probably my least favorite map,

**[13:55]** but that's not to say this map is bad.

**[13:57]** It totally succeeds in the mission of all these alternate maps,

**[14:01]** which is to significantly change the flow of the game and the focus.

**[14:05]** I think this map still does that with flying colors,

**[14:08]** definitely makes the game much, much different,

**[14:11]** and warps it in good ways.

**[14:14]** Definitely different ways, at least.

**[14:18]** One thing I've also seen thrown out there around the place on Discord

**[14:22]** as a way to, like, quote-unquote,

**[14:23]** improve this map,

**[14:25]** so if you want to try this at home,

**[14:26]** try that half-glacier rule.

**[14:28]** This is just at the end of the Doom phase,

**[14:31]** that first player,

**[14:32]** they only place one glacier instead of two,

**[14:35]** so it slows down the freezing over of the map a little bit,

**[14:38]** makes it more like a normal game of Cthulhu Wars.

**[14:42]** I've also heard people discuss, quote-unquote,

**[14:44]** tropical primeval,

**[14:45]** where they just ignore the glaciers

**[14:47]** and play this like an Earth map,

**[14:49]** but with a different continent configuration.

**[14:51]** I'll have to give that a go.

**[14:52]** I haven't tried it myself.

**[14:55]** And yeah, that's our last map-specific episode in the book,

**[14:58]** so thank you very much for listening.
