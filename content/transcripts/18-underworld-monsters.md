## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:24]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[00:27]** Hope you're doing well. I'm doing really well. I think I was only thinking I was going to record

**[00:35]** one episode today, and I'm going to record a second one. The stars are right. I'm feeling

**[00:40]** more awake than I normally am this time. The Earl Grey tea is hitting just right,

**[00:47]** and I got that caffeine coursing through my veins. I'm also going to be playing Cthulhu Wars in person

**[00:52]** for the first time in months tonight, so I'm very excited about that. Before we get into the episode,

**[00:59]** if you have been listening to all these episodes, I just want to call out something. I did update the

**[01:04]** episode description to mention this, but a very helpful listener reached out and let me know.

**[01:10]** I think I made a bit of a rules mistake in the Cho Cho episode. I just wanted to quickly address that

**[01:15]** here. I said something around the 25 minute mark of the Cho Cho episode about the way the Hierophant

**[01:22]** Spellbook works with the High Priest expansion in use. I go on to say and act like your opponents are

**[01:30]** going to get a High Priest every time you take a Spellbook once you get Hierophants. It's only the

**[01:35]** first time you take Hierophants, and at no other time will your opponents get a High Priest. Just

**[01:40]** wanted to clarify that. Thank you very much ElksElks on Discord for pointing this out to me. I'm not

**[01:47]** having anybody edit these episodes or review them for quality myself, so I do appreciate when people

**[01:53]** catch these kind of things. I figured it'd be better to just edit the episode description rather than

**[01:59]** re-upload and do a ninja edit that just wasn't going to work. Plus, most of the episode was written

**[02:05]** without the High Priest expansion being taken into account, so hopefully there's not too much

**[02:10]** confusion. Sorry if you were listening and you were like, that doesn't sound quite right. It's not right.

**[02:15]** You're right. I'm wrong. What are we talking about today? We're doing another neutral expansion, this

**[02:23]** time the Dreamlands Underworld Monsters. This is a neutral expansion that has three more neutral

**[02:29]** monsters you can add to your games of Cthulhu Wars. Quick reminder on neutral monsters, how do they

**[02:36]** work? You're going to purchase them from the pool during the Doom phase by paying to Doom. You're not

**[02:41]** going to be able to purchase more than one monster per Doom phase. This time they're all from the

**[02:47]** Dreamlands. You can read about them in the Dream quest to Unknown Kadath by H.P. Lovecraft. Also,

**[02:54]** the Silver Key and later Through the Gates with the Silver Key. All having to do with the

**[02:59]** Dreamlands. One characteristic of the Dreamlands, there is the surface level. There's also the

**[03:04]** Underworld. That is like kind of what it sounds like. A lot of nasties living in the Underworld.

**[03:09]** The way to get into the Dreamlands through the Underworld is mainly by going into a graveyard.

**[03:15]** There are doorways through graveyards on Earth into the Underworld of the Dreamlands,

**[03:20]** and Ghouls know where they are. All the monsters we're talking about today are like subterranean

**[03:25]** dwellers in the Dreamlands. Let's just get right into it and go over our first monster.

**[03:32]** I'll give them a little intro. They would reach the city of the Gugs, which is coterminous with the

**[03:37]** whole kingdom, through the proper burrows, emerging in a cemetery not far from the stair-containing

**[03:42]** Tower of Koth. They must beware, however, of a large cave near the cemetery, for this is the mouth

**[03:49]** of the Vaults of Zinn, and the vindictive Ghasts are always on watch there murderously for those

**[03:55]** denizens of the Upper Abyss who hunt and prey on them. The Ghasts try to come out when the Gugs sleep,

**[04:01]** and they attack Ghouls as readily as Ghasts, for they cannot discriminate. They are very primitive

**[04:06]** and eat one another. The Ghasts have a sentry at a narrow place in the Vaults of Zinn, but he's often

**[04:12]** drowsy and sometimes surprised by a party of Ghasts. Though Ghasts cannot live in real light,

**[04:17]** they can endure the gray twilight of the Abyss for hours. The first monster we have to discuss

**[04:24]** is the Ghast, and you heard a little bit about them just now from the Dream Quest story. The Ghast

**[04:32]** sculpt is pretty creepy. It's kind of tiny, nasty, a little zombie-like. I don't know. Their legs are

**[04:40]** kind of bird-like. They're very unsettling. They only vaguely look human.

**[04:47]** To get the Ghasts, we're going to pay two doom to obtain the loyalty card, and we're going to place

**[04:52]** all four Ghasts that are in the pool at our controlled Gates. So it sounds like you can

**[04:58]** split them across your Gates if you want to. It costs two to summon, and they have zero combat,

**[05:03]** which is a little bit unusual. The ability on Ghasts is called Hordling. It's an ongoing ability.

**[05:09]** When you spend two Power to summon Ghasts, all Ghasts in your pool are immediately placed on the map

**[05:14]** at any Gates you control. So pretty strange ability, and it's also odd that the Ghasts don't have any

**[05:21]** combat. Kind of unusual for neutral monsters, so normally when you see something like that,

**[05:27]** there's some other reason for having zero combat. In this case, it's because we can dump out all the

**[05:32]** Ghasts for only two Power at any one of our Gates. How do you use these? Well, as I said in other episodes,

**[05:40]** definitely in the Black Goat episode and probably elsewhere, zero combat is still good enough to,

**[05:46]** you know, defend a Gate. As long as you have a monster at the Gate, it will defend from other

**[05:50]** monsters. They won't be able to capture you. It doesn't matter if you have no combat, so that's

**[05:54]** something to keep in mind. With Hordling, you're going to be able to like put a bunch of junk, for lack

**[06:00]** of a better term, unimportant bodies in the way of areas that you care about. Even if you have a Gate

**[06:06]** with only one acolyte there, if you choose to put all of your Ghasts there, it's actually decently

**[06:11]** defended, at least from any force of monsters. Great old ones obviously can still run over and

**[06:17]** capture you, but it's going to be a little bit more of a pain if somebody wants to like actually

**[06:21]** battle you completely out of the way. There's a lot of bodies to remove if you put them all in

**[06:26]** one place like that. What factions like this? I would say defensive factions are going to like this as a

**[06:33]** way to protect your more valuable units in the area. So think your great old one that you don't

**[06:38]** want to lose. You can surround it by Ghasts, and that's a lot of like meat shields that you have to

**[06:43]** absorb kills. So I'd say the defensive factions like this mostly, and on the offensive side, nobody's

**[06:50]** really going to be able to make great use of this with one exception, which is by far the best faction

**[06:56]** to use with the Ghasts, and that is Great Cthulhu. And that's because you can use this with absorb

**[07:02]** to great effect. Quick reminder, absorb, if you have a Shoggoth before the battle, you can eat any

**[07:09]** number of your other units there, and you can roll three additional dice per unit that you absorb.

**[07:15]** With the Ghast, you can just be shotgunning like 12 extra dice in a battle. That's pretty awesome,

**[07:22]** and to do it again, it only costs you two Power to resummon all of your Ghasts at one Gate.

**[07:27]** Wow, I like this for Great Cthulhu. It's extremely, extremely strong to be able to roll that many

**[07:32]** dice over and over again, and reload your shotgun for only two Power. You couldn't ask for a better

**[07:37]** unit to use with absorb. If you're ever Great Cthulhu in a game and the Ghasts are in the pool,

**[07:43]** that is your top priority is purchasing them if you can. And if you're in a game with Great Cthulhu

**[07:49]** and Ghasts in the pool, try to buy them just so Great Cthulhu can't have them, because it is that

**[07:54]** good with this faction. Not much more say on that one, we can move on to our second unit.

**[08:02]** The Gugs, hairy and gigantic, once reared stone circles in that wood and made strange sacrifices

**[08:08]** to the outer gods and the crawling chaos in Arlathotep. Until one night, an abomination of

**[08:13]** those reached the ears of Earth's gods, and they were banished to caverns below. Only a great trapdoor

**[08:19]** of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the Earth Ghouls with the enchanted wood. In this,

**[08:24]** the Gugs are afraid to open because of a curse. The second unit we have to discuss is the Gugs.

**[08:32]** Sculpt for this one, pretty cool. Gugs are sort of ape-like. They look like they're covered in fur.

**[08:39]** They don't not look like an ape from Earth, but their arms are split, so they have kind of like

**[08:45]** one main trunk, but then it splits into two arms. So it looks like they have like four arms.

**[08:50]** And then they have a nasty, no eyes, big mouth for a face, getting some Demogorgon,

**[08:57]** Stranger Things vibes, looking at the mouth. They look really strong. They look like they could,

**[09:02]** they know how to punch. Looks like they're making a fist as well, getting ready to punch.

**[09:08]** In order to get the Gugs, you're going to have to pay two Doom to obtain this loyalty card,

**[09:12]** and then you're going to place one Gug at your controlled Gates. There's two Gugs in total.

**[09:18]** They have a cost of one and a combat of three. The ability on Gugs is clumsy. It's an ongoing

**[09:26]** ability. A Gug cannot capture a Cultist. You were hoping for more? There's not more, that's it.

**[09:35]** These are just big dumb idiots that are under-costed for the amount of combat dice they have. They only

**[09:41]** cost one. They have a combat of three. They can't capture Cultists. Whatever. Who cares?

**[09:47]** Normally I'd have more to say, but there's not that much else to say. Which factions like this?

**[09:52]** Anybody could use this. I don't think this is like a top pick neutral to recruit, not by a long shot,

**[09:58]** because you're not really getting anything out of it. But defensive factions might have a hard time

**[10:03]** rolling a lot of combat dice, so they might enjoy the bolstering of dice in an important area for not

**[10:09]** a lot of cost to summon. And yeah, of course, offensive factions, anything with a death ball

**[10:15]** that's able to move around cheaply, they're also going to enjoy adding between three and six dice to

**[10:20]** their army. And the last monster we have to discuss for this episode is the Lang Spider. I don't have a

**[10:31]** great quote from any story mentioning Lang Spiders. I just know that Lang's almost humans fought with the

**[10:37]** bloated purple spiders of the neighboring veils. So assume that's talking about the Lang Spider before

**[10:44]** the story goes on to talk about Moonbeasts. They certainly seem like they fit that description.

**[10:50]** The abdomen of the Lang Spider certainly looks bloated. Oh, it looks like a almost like a group

**[10:55]** of grapes. It's so bloated and disgusting. Otherwise, yeah, it's pretty standard issue. Spider got

**[11:02]** eight legs, not unusual spider mouth, couple sets of eyes, looks like eight eyes. Yeah, so another one,

**[11:10]** great one for your arachnophobic friends. You can get the Lang Spider by paying two doom to obtain

**[11:17]** their loyalty card, and then you place one Lang Spider at your controlled Gates. You've got three of

**[11:22]** them, they cost two, and they have a combat of one. And the ability on Lang Spiders is called

**[11:27]** Bloodthirst. It's an ongoing ability. If a Lang Spider is involved in a battle, you may exchange two

**[11:33]** pain results for a kill before results are assigned. You may do this once for each Lang Spider in the

**[11:39]** battle. Each use of this ability may be applied to your results or your opponent's results.

**[11:46]** So very interesting. I think the Lang Spider is easily the cream of the crop with this group of

**[11:52]** units. It's just a very nice ability. The more dice you roll, the more likely it is that you can

**[11:57]** convert two pains into an extra kill. They only roll one combat by themselves, so they're going to

**[12:02]** need some assistance in order to actually make extra kills. For that reason, which factions like them?

**[12:09]** Definitely, definitely the fighty factions. Anything that's going to be able to roll like 10 dice,

**[12:14]** it's pretty good. You got a one in three shot of rolling a pain, so if you're able to roll six dice,

**[12:20]** it's probably going to roll two pains, and that's an extra kill if you have a Lang Spider in the battle.

**[12:26]** You can never manage to have two or three Lang Spiders in the battle and roll like over 10 dice,

**[12:31]** that all of a sudden becomes very dangerous. You might be rolling two or three extra kills,

**[12:36]** and that is like a big deal when fighting anybody. Anything that can move around cheaply,

**[12:42]** like a submerging Cthulhu or a arctic winding Windwalker, is going to enjoy the Lang Spiders.

**[12:51]** Not too much else to say on this one. It's just a nice bread and butter neutral unit that I do think

**[12:57]** is worth the two doom, because the potential to roll extra kills here is pretty high.

**[13:04]** And I think that's all that we have for this episode. Sort of a stranger expansion here. I do think

**[13:12]** the gas and Gugs are pretty underwhelming when compared to the Lang Spider, so I can't fully

**[13:19]** endorse this one, but if you have some spare money lying around, if you are trying to collect all

**[13:25]** the neutrals, pick these up. The Lang Spiders are pretty fun. I'd put them up there among the most

**[13:32]** desirable neutrals to get. If you roll a decent amount of combat dice, you are going to enjoy

**[13:37]** having some spiders and rolling some extra kills.

**[13:40]** The surface monsters and then these underworld monsters, I like them together. I like that they

**[13:47]** took a lot of the theme and the lore from the Dreamlands setting and put it into neutral units

**[13:54]** for Cthulhu Wars. I'm certainly going to be making a pitch tonight to my group to see if anyone's going

**[14:00]** to be interested in playing with the neutral units. I'm really angling for maybe a game on the Dreamlands

**[14:07]** with all the Dreamlands monsters and maybe a couple great old ones in there for Spice, so

**[14:11]** see what we can get away with and I'll report back in another episode if I am able to play such a game.

**[14:17]** With that said, that's another episode in the book, so thank you very much for listening. Don't forget to
