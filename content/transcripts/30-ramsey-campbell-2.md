## Transcript

**[00:00]** After I read in the revelations of Glacky about the way to prove this idea of mine,

**[00:05]** I determined to see for myself what I would be invoking. It was mostly trial and error,

**[00:10]** but finally one night I found myself materializing in a place I'd never been before.

**[00:15]** There were walls and columns so high I couldn't even see where they ended,

**[00:19]** and in the middle of the floor was a great fissure running from wall to wall,

**[00:23]** jagged as if from an earthquake. As I watched, the outlines of the crack seemed to dim and blur,

**[00:29]** and something rose up out of it. I told you that image looks very different in its own dimension.

**[00:35]** Well, I saw the living counterpart, and you'll understand if I don't try to describe it.

**[00:40]** It stood there swaying for a moment and then began to expand.

**[00:43]** It would have engulfed me in a few minutes, but I didn't wait for that.

**[00:47]** I ran off between the columns.

**[00:59]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:09]** My name's Graham, and I'm your host.

**[01:12]** I hope you're doing well wherever you are.

**[01:14]** I'm doing okay. The weather's been very crazy.

**[01:18]** The temperature differentials have been all over the place, so

**[01:21]** just having one of those weekends. I'm recording on the weekend, which is nice, but

**[01:25]** it's just been one of those weekends where you're kind of trying to drink lots of hot liquids and

**[01:29]** avoid getting sick, because the air is getting dry, and I don't do so well in the cold weather.

**[01:35]** But I'll do my best. Hopefully my voice stays good through this whole thing.

**[01:41]** Today, we're going to be continuing our Ramsey Campbell-based discussion.

**[01:46]** This time, we'll be discussing the Ramsey Campbell Horrors Pack number two.

**[01:52]** It's another group of independent units that you can add to your games of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:59]** In this case, you got one monster and two more great old ones.

**[02:04]** We'll go ahead and get started with our first unit.

**[02:07]** I'm going to start with the Seder.

**[02:09]** I tried really hard to find the story that the Saters are from.

**[02:14]** I still don't know what it is.

**[02:15]** I spent a decent amount of time researching this.

**[02:18]** I still don't know.

**[02:19]** If you do, please let me know so I can read it myself.

**[02:23]** But yeah, Ramsey Campbell did write a story with Saters.

**[02:26]** These do not appear to be the nice, fun-loving, wine-drinking variety.

**[02:31]** These are like spooky Saters.

**[02:33]** These don't look like they'd be fun at a party.

**[02:36]** Satyr is sculpted by Arnaud Bellier.

**[02:40]** Good job making something spooky.

**[02:42]** Looks like someone may be transforming into one.

**[02:45]** I can see like some normal human-looking pants.

**[02:49]** They got one arm.

**[02:50]** They got some spine coming out beneath the arm.

**[02:53]** And then it just looks like the other arm on the other side is just completely ripped off

**[02:57]** or growing there.

**[02:59]** I'm not really sure what's going on there.

**[03:00]** But heads looking kind of like a goblin-demon vibes going on.

**[03:05]** Not the friendly-looking Saters that I picture when I hear the word.

**[03:13]** To obtain the Satyr, you're going to need to pay two Doom in the Doom phase.

**[03:17]** And then you'll get to place a Satyr and an Acolyte Cultist at your controlled Gate.

**[03:22]** It's kind of nice.

**[03:23]** You got three of them in the pool.

**[03:25]** They cost two to summon.

**[03:26]** And they have one for combat.

**[03:28]** The ability on the Satyr is...

**[03:32]** I believe it's fecund is how you say this word.

**[03:35]** Ongoing.

**[03:36]** Each time you summon a Satyr, also place an Acolyte Cultist from your pool into the same area.

**[03:43]** So this is cool.

**[03:44]** This is kind of a, I would say, very fair and middle-of-the-road monster.

**[03:48]** Not going to be highly picked or sought after.

**[03:51]** But if it's in the pool, maybe you can make some use of it.

**[03:55]** One thing when you buy this initially, you do get an Acolyte Cultist along with your first Satyr.

**[04:01]** That's cool.

**[04:02]** Assuming you have one in the pool.

**[04:05]** My main issue with this one is the cost in Doom.

**[04:08]** It just doesn't really have a way to pay for itself.

**[04:12]** Yeah, you're getting your Acolytes back.

**[04:14]** But I think in general, I would want to be re-recruiting my Acolytes and summoning monsters and doing whatever as slowly as possible.

**[04:24]** As opposed to all at once.

**[04:26]** But there is something to be said for having a panic button and immediately putting two bodies out at once.

**[04:33]** Maybe somebody's coming to threaten your great old one.

**[04:37]** And summoning one monster is just going to feel a little bit inadequate.

**[04:40]** You really want to have extra shields in the battle.

**[04:43]** That's where the Satyrs, I see them being the most useful.

**[04:48]** And of course, these are going to feel downright bad if you don't have any Cultists in the pool.

**[04:53]** Because you're not getting any sort of bonus recruit alongside each Satyr that you summon.

**[04:59]** Ultimately, I'm not super impressed with this one.

**[05:02]** Don't think it's the worst neutral monster.

**[05:05]** But it's definitely in that bottom tier.

**[05:08]** I'm definitely not coming after this.

**[05:10]** Unless maybe it's the last thing in the pool.

**[05:13]** What factions like the Satyr?

**[05:16]** I think anybody who can get Cultists into their pool can make use of this decently.

**[05:22]** So I'm thinking Black Goat is a good shout because you have Fertility Cult.

**[05:26]** You have unlimited summons.

**[05:27]** So if someone were to move into Shub's area, you could very quickly pay up to 6 Power,

**[05:33]** summon multiple Satyrs, and you'd get the Cultists to go alongside them.

**[05:36]** That's like 2 or 4 or 6 bodies in the area with Shub as an unlimited action also.

**[05:42]** I think that's pretty good.

**[05:44]** Even if you don't have unlimited combat, you could still combat as your normal action.

**[05:48]** That's something I like to do quite a bit.

**[05:50]** If somebody encroaches into my area too soon,

**[05:53]** I will just spend 5 or 6 Power on summoning and then fight them as my normal action.

**[05:57]** I could see this being good with Cthulhu as well, who's going to be devolving.

**[06:03]** Maybe it's nice with Yellow Sign and Passion.

**[06:07]** Maybe this could be good with Demon Sultan too, who's always getting their Cultists captured.

**[06:12]** They want to be doing that psychosis stalling, but maybe in this case they need to protect one of their avatars.

**[06:18]** The only way to do that is get more bodies in the battle.

**[06:22]** Kind of a weird one.

**[06:24]** Not the best, not the worst.

**[06:25]** So if you have any good use cases for Satyrs that I missed, definitely let me know.

**[06:30]** I think that's all I have to say on the Satyrs, so we'll move on to our next unit.

**[06:37]** Beyond a gulf in the subterranean night, a passage leads to a wall of massive bricks.

**[06:42]** And beyond the wall rises Egonac to be served by the tattered eyeless figures of the dark.

**[06:48]** Long as he slept beyond the wall, and those which crawl over the bricks scuttle across his body, never knowing it to be Egonac.

**[06:56]** But when his name is spoken or read, he comes forth to be worshipped, or to feed and take on the shape and soul of those he feeds upon.

**[07:05]** For those who read of evil and search for its form within their minds call forth evil.

**[07:09]** And so may Egonac return to walk among men, and wait that time when the end is cleared off and Cthulhu rises from his tomb among the weeds.

**[07:19]** Glackey thrusts open the crystal trap door.

**[07:22]** The brood of Ihort are born into daylight.

**[07:26]** Shub-Nigguroth strides forth to smash the moon lens.

**[07:30]** Beatus bursts forth from his prison.

**[07:32]** Daloth tears away illusion to expose the reality concealed behind.

**[07:40]** Yes, our second unit in this expansion to discuss is Egonac.

**[07:47]** Egonac's from the story Cold Print by Ramsay Campbell.

**[07:51]** Very weird story.

**[07:53]** They don't come right on site.

**[07:54]** I feel like this guy in the story is like maybe looking for like erotic novels or something, but he ends up finding Egonac instead on his way to doing that.

**[08:03]** Very short and creepy.

**[08:06]** Weird story.

**[08:07]** Good imagery.

**[08:08]** Definitely give it a read.

**[08:09]** It's not very long.

**[08:12]** Sculpted by Joe Brumby.

**[08:14]** Good job, Joe.

**[08:16]** Very gross and disgusting.

**[08:18]** Reminds me a lot of how it's described in the book, so great job taking what's on the page and making it real.

**[08:25]** It's got two big thick legs.

**[08:29]** Kind of a humanoid looking body with the arms raised, but the arms are just very thick and gross and they look like they have mouths on the hands.

**[08:37]** There's also like a deflated human head just like hanging around on the chest here.

**[08:42]** That is very disgusting.

**[08:46]** To awaken Egonac, you're going to need a controlled Gate in an area with your great old one.

**[08:51]** And you're going to pay only two Power and place Egonac in the area containing the Gate.

**[08:57]** Egonac has a combat of one.

**[08:59]** And their ability is orifices.

**[09:02]** Great name.

**[09:03]** Post battle.

**[09:04]** If Egonac is killed in battle, select a surviving enemy terror monster or Cultist.

**[09:10]** We place it with Egonac, then give Egonac's loyalty card to that player.

**[09:14]** If no enemy survived, Egonac dies normally, placing this loyalty card in the general pool.

**[09:21]** And this ability is not optional.

**[09:23]** So that's a bit strange, but let me explain the rest of it because it all goes together.

**[09:27]** The Spellbook requirement is you've just received Egonac as a result of the orifices' ability.

**[09:35]** Whoever Egonac is getting donated to earns their Spellbook right away.

**[09:39]** And that Spellbook is the revelations.

**[09:41]** During the doom phase, every player except you gets one Elder Sign.

**[09:45]** This is not optional.

**[09:46]** So here we have what I see as another kind of like poison pill, great old one.

**[09:54]** It kind of reminds me of Bokrug from, what is that, great old one, pack two maybe.

**[10:01]** The play pattern kind of works like you get Egonac, you get Egonac killed somehow.

**[10:07]** Maybe it's like a suicide mission.

**[10:10]** Presumably there is a terror monster or Cultist that is alive on the other side.

**[10:15]** So your enemy ends up losing one of their units, essentially gaining Egonac.

**[10:21]** Then they also have the loyalty card and they have earned the Spellbook.

**[10:26]** So when the doom phase comes around, everybody but them gets an Elder Sign.

**[10:31]** And you're laughing all the way to the bank as you get free Elder Signs.

**[10:37]** So I think this one is pretty funny that you just kind of set off a chain of misery

**[10:42]** once you start donating this to people.

**[10:45]** It's just kind of like a hot potato.

**[10:48]** Nobody wants to have it under their control when the doom phase comes around

**[10:51]** because all the other opponents are going to earn an Elder Sign.

**[10:55]** The only thing you have to be careful about is if no enemies survive a battle with Egonac,

**[11:01]** it just dies normally.

**[11:02]** So maybe don't pick fights with Egonac that you think you're going to win.

**[11:08]** Pick fights that you think you're going to lose.

**[11:10]** I think that's some basic advice I would give.

**[11:12]** Overall, very weird.

**[11:14]** Great old one.

**[11:15]** I've not actually seen this one in play before, but I'm interested to see how it would go.

**[11:20]** So I want to get this on the table sometime.

**[11:24]** What factions like this?

**[11:25]** It's a pretty weird one.

**[11:27]** I'm not really sure what to say here.

**[11:31]** I guess the defensive factions can deter combat with this,

**[11:34]** but I could also see really anybody using this

**[11:37]** and kind of rolling up on any decently defended Gate with just Egonac to do something.

**[11:43]** They're rolling like five or six dice.

**[11:45]** You're probably donating it to them.

**[11:48]** I guess the other thing you need to consider with this one,

**[11:51]** you need to be careful about unlimited combat.

**[11:53]** You don't want to like move and then unlimited battle

**[11:57]** and then donate a Golanac only to have the person that you just gave it to.

**[12:02]** They also have unlimited combat.

**[12:03]** They could just move and maybe battle you again and then give it right back to you.

**[12:07]** You don't want that.

**[12:08]** So be a little bit careful when unlimited combat starts coming online, I guess.

**[12:13]** Very interesting push and pull.

**[12:15]** Assuming nobody like completely wipes out the opponent and puts Egonac back in the pool,

**[12:20]** it's just shifting hands over and over and over again.

**[12:23]** I think it would make for some pretty funny moments.

**[12:27]** I don't think anybody will be too salty about this one,

**[12:29]** so I kind of want to see this one in play.

**[12:33]** I think that's enough about Egonac,

**[12:35]** so we'll move on to the final unit in this expansion.

**[12:39]** 

**[13:09]** The final unit here is another great old one.

**[13:12]** It is the Render of Veils,

**[13:14]** Dowloth,

**[13:15]** sculpted by James Vandersheik.

**[13:19]** Hopefully I'm saying their name right.

**[13:20]** Great job.

**[13:21]** I think this is actually my favorite sculpt in the whole game.

**[13:24]** I just love how strange looking it is.

**[13:28]** It's just a swirling, kind of spiraling,

**[13:31]** I don't even want to say it looks like a snake.

**[13:33]** It looks kind of like almost science-y, like a chemistry,

**[13:37]** like maybe a helix.

**[13:39]** Anyway, they did a really good job making this kind of look like

**[13:42]** it's from another dimension.

**[13:44]** It's not even from our things that we can relate to as humans.

**[13:48]** So very cool looking.

**[13:49]** I'm a big fan of this one.

**[13:52]** You can read about Dowloth in the story

**[13:54]** The Render of Veils by Ramsey Campbell.

**[13:58]** He's also written a trilogy of novels about Dowloth.

**[14:02]** I'm actually just getting started reading it now,

**[14:05]** so looking forward to seeing how that goes.

**[14:07]** Maybe I'll leave another update in another episode on how that's going,

**[14:11]** but that was written by Ramsey Campbell pretty recently,

**[14:14]** like 2016 and sooner,

**[14:16]** so I'm sure it's going to be very good.

**[14:18]** I'm excited to get into those further.

**[14:23]** To obtain Dowloth,

**[14:25]** you're going to need a controlled Gate in an area with your Great Old One,

**[14:29]** and then you're going to pay 6 Power

**[14:31]** and place Dowloth in the area containing the Gate.

**[14:36]** And Dowloth has a combat of 0,

**[14:38]** and the ability is Cosmic Unity.

**[14:42]** It's a pre-battle.

**[14:43]** In a battle involving Dowloth, choose one enemy Great Old One.

**[14:47]** It rolls no combat dice.

**[14:49]** It still gets its battle ability if it has one.

**[14:53]** Very cool ability right off the bat,

**[14:55]** Cosmic Unity is.

**[14:57]** It's like a peaceful Great Old One,

**[14:59]** just doesn't want to have real big violent fights with other Great Old Ones.

**[15:03]** I think that's very cool.

**[15:05]** This does a lot of work shutting down.

**[15:07]** Crawling Chaos kind of humiliates Narlathotep,

**[15:10]** makes Cthulhu look a little bit silly too,

**[15:13]** although they still get the Devourer off.

**[15:16]** Very effective at shutting down some of these more proactive factions

**[15:21]** that might be coming for you.

**[15:23]** They're going to have to work a little bit harder

**[15:24]** to try to get your Gates if Dowloth is hanging out on one of them.

**[15:30]** The Spellbook requirement is

**[15:31]** a Great Old One is killed anywhere on the map.

**[15:34]** It's another one of these Spellbook requirements.

**[15:36]** It's just going to happen probably when you're playing Cthulhu War,

**[15:40]** so don't force it.

**[15:41]** Certainly don't throw any of your Great Old Ones under the bus

**[15:43]** to try to achieve this.

**[15:45]** It's just going to happen as the game plays out.

**[15:49]** And the Spellbook for Dalloth is interdimensional, ongoing.

**[15:53]** When Dalloth enters an area without a Gate,

**[15:55]** immediately place a Gate there.

**[15:59]** Totally wild Spellbook.

**[16:01]** Sign me up always for the cheap Gates.

**[16:03]** Paying one Power to move is enough to build a Gate now.

**[16:07]** Openers crying tears of joy.

**[16:09]** Getting their Spellbooks met with this is going to be a breeze.

**[16:13]** Witch factions like this one.

**[16:16]** I think it's just going to be overall useful,

**[16:19]** regardless of who takes it,

**[16:21]** which is a great thing.

**[16:23]** Cosmic Unity is going to be great on offense and defense,

**[16:27]** and interdimensional is pretty strong.

**[16:30]** Just building Gates wherever you want,

**[16:32]** leaving a trail of Gates behind you.

**[16:34]** Pretty nice.

**[16:36]** You might not want to do that,

**[16:37]** maybe if you're playing against opener or something like that,

**[16:40]** but generally more Gates is good,

**[16:42]** even if you don't always control them.

**[16:45]** More Gates on the map is just more players,

**[16:47]** like maybe spreading themselves thin,

**[16:49]** and anyone controlling a Gate is a Gate that you can come and claim for yourself.

**[16:54]** 

**[16:55]** all-around very cool,

**[16:56]** great old one.

**[16:57]** One of my favorites.

**[16:59]** Maybe I'll end up making a Daloth faction after I read these novels.

**[17:05]** I think that's all that I have for Ramsey Campbell Horrors number two.

**[17:10]** Give you my closing thoughts.

**[17:13]** I think this one's another hit.

**[17:14]** Things are pretty cool here.

**[17:17]** Igolanak and Daloth are both very interesting designs

**[17:20]** that are doing some pretty unusual things

**[17:23]** and probably have a pretty big effect on the game.

**[17:28]** Satyrs I'm not super impressed by.

**[17:30]** Very middling monster,

**[17:32]** but I think there are use cases for it.

**[17:34]** I'm just not very excited to recruit this one.

**[17:38]** If I'm playing Blackout,

**[17:39]** I probably would buy this one just to see how it is.

**[17:42]** And yeah,

**[17:44]** obviously the stories behind these are the main attraction for me,

**[17:47]** so if you happen to pick up Cold Print,

**[17:51]** you can read about both these great old ones there.

**[17:53]** And yeah,

**[17:54]** I'm excited to get further into The Searching Dead,

**[17:57]** which is the first book in the Three Births of Daloth trilogy.

**[18:02]** And I'll let you know how it's going in a future episode.

**[18:06]** That's another one in the book,

**[18:08]** so thank you very much for listening.

**[18:10]** Please rate, review, and subscribe if you can.

**[18:13]** That would be really nice.

**[18:32]** have a nice evening,

**[18:34]** wherever it is that you are.

**[18:35]** Thanks.

**[18:35]** Bye.

**[18:36]** You've been looking at that yellow egg-shaped thing there,

**[19:06]** off and on,

**[19:07]** ever since you came in.

**[19:09]** You've read of them in the Necronomicon.

**[19:11]** Remember those references to the crystallizers of dream?

**[19:14]** That's one of them.

**[19:15]** The device that projects you when asleep into other dimensions.

**[19:19]** Takes a bit of getting used to,

**[19:21]** but for some years,

**[19:22]** I've been able to enter nearly every dimension as high as the 25th.

**[19:26]** If only I could convey to you the sensations of that last plane,

**[19:30]** where it is the space which exists and matter can have no existence.

**[19:34]** Don't ask me where I got the crystallizer, by the way.

**[19:37]** Till I can be sure its guardian will not follow,

**[19:40]** I must never speak of it.

**[19:41]** But never mind that.

**[19:42]** Missed.
