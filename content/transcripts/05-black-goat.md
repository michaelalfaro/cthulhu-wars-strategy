## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, welcome to Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars. My name's Graham,

**[00:24]** I'm your host. Today, I'm very excited to finally bring you my second faction guide,

**[00:31]** this time all about my favorite faction, Black Goat. I wanted to do something similar to the

**[00:38]** Great Cthulhu guide, where I read a passage from some story that talks about Black Goat itself,

**[00:44]** but it turns out there's actually not really a story that prominently features Black Goat.

**[00:49]** Mainly, Black Goat is just sort of invoked here and there around different stories. You can find

**[00:55]** the Black Goat being mentioned in, I think notably, The Whisperer and Darkness. It also comes in Out of

**[01:02]** the Aeons is mentioned in a few lines. Normally, when the Black Goat gets mentioned in a story,

**[01:08]** it's usually just,

**[01:10]** I would have read you more if I could. I was actually looking around,

**[01:18]** trying to reread some Ramsey Campbell stories, because I know he also mentioned the Black Goat

**[01:24]** at some point. I couldn't remember the story or find it before recording this.

**[01:29]** So, rather than read about the Black Goat, I just maybe want to do a quick aside. This great old one

**[01:36]** is called Shub-Nagroth. It's 2023. It's probably clear to you that's sort of a problematic name.

**[01:44]** I'm going to refer to Black Goat, great old one, as Shub from here on out. And just so it's very

**[01:50]** clear, this podcast condemns racism in the strongest possible terms. And if that's something that you

**[01:57]** don't agree with, by all means, please don't listen to this podcast. I don't need you to be

**[02:02]** one of my listeners. Thanks. H.P. Lovecraft was a good writer, maybe not a great writer.

**[02:08]** He was a pretty objectionable human being. Consider Black Goat to be a little bit like

**[02:15]** Lady Antebellum, changing their name to Lady A. We're just going to call Shub-Nagroth Shub from now on.

**[02:22]** I really like cosmic horror as a genre. It has this unfortunate problem, like many older stories do,

**[02:28]** where the language is just not really aged very well. We're here to celebrate these stories and

**[02:33]** these authors and this mythos, but I think it's important that we also acknowledge the negative

**[02:39]** aspects of some of these earlier works. But I'm happy to say that in the 21st century, there's like

**[02:45]** a lot of good cosmic horror still being written, but not having any of those racist tropes. Or if it does

**[02:51]** present any racism in the story, it's sort of turning it on its head. So in place of reading from a story

**[02:57]** today, I'm instead going to make you a couple of recommendations of good books you can check out.

**[03:02]** And if you've not seen the HBO show Lovecraft Country, it's based on a book by Matt Ruff. You should

**[03:09]** definitely check that out. In fact, there's going to be a sequel released in the not-too-distant future,

**[03:16]** I believe in Q1 2023. Another book, which I would actually say is maybe the best cosmic horror novelette

**[03:23]** I've read so far, would be The Ballad of Black Tom by Victor Laval. I would definitely highly,

**[03:29]** highly recommend that one. It does this really great thing where it retells a pretty unremarkable,

**[03:37]** pretty racist Lovecraft story called The Horror at Red Hook, but retells the story from the perspective

**[03:44]** of the protagonist who's a person of color, rather than the original, which tells the story from the

**[03:50]** perspective of the Irish police officer that's just kind of going around and harassing the people in the

**[03:57]** bad part of town. The retelling is just so much better, orders of magnitude better than the original.

**[04:04]** I would really love to see that be adapted into some kind of a movie because I thought it was so,

**[04:09]** so good. I gasped while I was reading it. Anyway, that's enough book talk. I think we are ready to get

**[04:15]** into the faction overview proper. So starting with my opening thoughts on this faction. This is my

**[04:23]** favorite faction, full disclosure. I'm going to try to be as unbiased and objective as possible, but

**[04:29]** this faction is awesome. It's so fun to play when played well. It's a puzzle. I love puzzles. This

**[04:36]** faction feels the most puzzly to me of any Cthulhu Wars faction, and like it's not really clear sometimes

**[04:42]** what the best thing for you to do is. This faction is, it's really strong actually when played well, but the

**[04:49]** problem is it's among the most difficult factions to pilot properly. I'd put it right up there with

**[04:55]** Opener of the Way, but when you can do it well, it's going to feel like one of the strongest factions

**[05:01]** in the game. Let's go over the unique faction ability for Black Goat. That's Fertility Cult. It's an

**[05:08]** ongoing ability, and it says you may summon monsters as an unlimited action. Pretty spicy.

**[05:15]** If you have an older printing of Cthulhu Wars, you might see that the wording is a slightly different

**[05:20]** on Fertility Cult as I've read it just now. That's because there's been a balance change to this

**[05:26]** faction. I'm not even going to read you the old wording of Fertility Cult. This wording is just more

**[05:31]** elegant and more functional. In our learn to play episode, we know the unlimited actions that we have

**[05:37]** access to are stepping on and off a Gate, and eventually we'll also have unlimited battle after

**[05:44]** we get all six of our Spellbooks. Black Goat has access to summoning monsters as an unlimited action

**[05:49]** at all points in the game. This ability can be very handy on offense or on defense. If anybody just

**[05:56]** flies their great old one, I always make Narlathotep the bad guy in all of my examples. Sorry. If anybody

**[06:03]** moves their great old one into your area, you can very quickly on your turn reinforce with units

**[06:11]** and then fight because that's not even your normal action. If you have 10 Power, 12 Power, and you

**[06:17]** really, really don't want someone to be there, you can spend like 6 Power, 7 Power, summon a bunch of

**[06:22]** monsters all at once and then still have the ability to fight them and push them away, which I really,

**[06:28]** really like. Be careful how much Power you end up spending on Fertility Cult at one point in time.

**[06:34]** You want to spend your Power slowly, but in an emergency, you can really use your Get Out Now

**[06:39]** card and summon a bunch of things right off the bat to get rid of any bad people who might be in your

**[06:45]** space. So without going on too much longer about Fertility Cult, it's just important to know that

**[06:51]** it is not the most Powerful unique faction ability out there, but it is very flexible,

**[06:59]** has applications whether you want to stop people from showing up at your Gates, or when you're using

**[07:05]** it offensively, moving into a new Gate or capturing to conquer a new Gate, you can summon monsters right

**[07:12]** away to guard that Gate instead of having to wait for another rotation around the table before it's your

**[07:16]** turn. That's all I really have to say about Fertility Cult. It's not the most useful unique

**[07:23]** ability in the world, but does have its place and can bail you out and come in very handy in like

**[07:29]** multiple different situations. Let's now go over the Spellbook requirements for Black Goat.

**[07:36]** There are three here, they're all related to each other. I'd say maybe even four of them are related to

**[07:42]** each other, and this contributes to what I was mentioning at the top of the episode about

**[07:46]** kind of the puzzling nature of this faction. Have units in four areas, have units in six areas,

**[07:54]** have units in eight areas, and then share areas with all your enemies, and when you get this Spellbook

**[08:01]** requirement met, you gain one Power per enemy player. Let's talk about the first three. You need to be in

**[08:08]** many areas in order to get all of your Spellbooks as a Black Goat. So basically over the course of the

**[08:14]** game, you're going to need to somehow safely expand into this many areas, and then typically afterward,

**[08:21]** the Black Goat player tends to then like contract and build up in the areas that they are safe in.

**[08:29]** Somehow you're going to need to spread out your units into eight areas, which can seem a little

**[08:34]** daunting, especially in your first game. I think a lot of players early on in their Black Goat experience,

**[08:41]** they tend to spread out more quickly than they should. They sort of end up sabotaging themselves,

**[08:47]** and I can really talk more about that later, about warding the Black Goat. Really what you need to know

**[08:52]** about these is you do need to spread out, but you don't need to do it like immediately. When you think

**[08:59]** about it, the four areas book is not free, but it is pretty much like something that's just naturally

**[09:06]** going to happen from you playing Cthulhu Wars. It's really the six and eight areas that you need

**[09:10]** to worry about, and you've got a lot of time. You've got multiple action phases to figure out how to

**[09:15]** get into that position, and you've got a lot of tools to help you do this. Let's talk a little bit

**[09:22]** more about the share arrows with all enemies Spellbook. So this one is actually also a little

**[09:28]** bit of a balance change here. You didn't used to get Power back for this Spellbook requirement,

**[09:32]** if you can believe it. Again, if you had older printing of this faction, you wouldn't see that

**[09:37]** part about the gaining the Power back. This was added basically because this ability does not scale well

**[09:42]** in a large player game. If you're playing a three-player game with Black Goat, okay, it's very easy to

**[09:48]** share areas with all enemies. Try playing a six- or an eight-player game with Black Goat and share areas

**[09:54]** with all enemies with no reward was a little bit much to ask for. You might have stumbled upon an

**[10:01]** area where there was like three or four players in one area, but it's really, really nice now to have

**[10:06]** a little bit of like a Power windfall to meeting that requirement. Now, if you're playing in a five- or

**[10:12]** six-player game and you actually do meet that requirement, it's a huge gain. Playing in a five-player

**[10:18]** game and then just randomly getting a Spellbook for this requirement and getting four Power back

**[10:24]** is a huge deal. I actually really like to spend some of my last Power getting into this position,

**[10:30]** then you get four Power back and you're very much still in the game and still doing stuff.

**[10:35]** Figuring out the timing on this one is also really handy. If you can ever manage to like get into six

**[10:41]** or eight areas and then also meet the requirements for sharing areas with all enemies at the same time,

**[10:46]** that's really what you want to be doing. You're going to get that Power back that you just spent

**[10:52]** on movement and be able to like defend yourself or contract and move your acolytes or your other

**[10:58]** units back to safety. And on top of all that, you're also getting two or three Spellbooks at the same

**[11:04]** time. We've got two more Spellbook requirements. One of those is awakening Shub, as you might expect.

**[11:11]** Every faction, you need to awaken your great old one. The last public requirement for this faction

**[11:16]** is as your action, eliminate two of your Cultists from any area on the map. This one is actually

**[11:22]** really handy. Going along with the spreading out thing, if you can ever get into your eight areas,

**[11:29]** you may have stray acolytes hanging out where there's no Gates just kind of waiting to be captured.

**[11:34]** It's really, really nice to, if possible, save this Spellbook requirement for later once you've

**[11:39]** gotten into those eight areas. You can then sacrifice two acolytes that aren't doing anything for you

**[11:45]** out in the middle of nowhere. You've saved them. You can kind of like reconsolidate your forces in

**[11:50]** one central area afterward, and you've gotten your last Spellbook. All that being said, I think there's

**[11:56]** also a strong case to be made for taking this Spellbook requirement very early for specific

**[12:00]** abilities. I'm thinking of mainly Frenzy, Thousand Young, or Necrophagy. All of those are going to be

**[12:07]** very useful for any early Black Goat shenanigans in the first couple action phases,

**[12:11]** but we'll go over those in more detail in a bit. With the Spellbook requirements out of the way,

**[12:18]** we can now talk a little bit about the units that Black Goat has, starting with acolytes.

**[12:24]** Every faction has acolytes. The unique acolytes for Black Goat are very awesome. In my acolyte Power

**[12:32]** rankings, they're in the top three. They've got a sweet goat skull mask thing going on. They've got

**[12:38]** what looks like a chain around their hands. They look like they're down for anything,

**[12:41]** any kind of party where they might not make it out alive. They're cool with it.

**[12:46]** That goes a little bit along with the Spellbook that works with the Black Goat acolytes. That's

**[12:50]** Blood Sacrifice. I'll talk more about that in a minute. Black Goat acolytes also have another

**[12:55]** Spellbook that works with them. That's Frenzy. This one's really simple. It just gives them

**[13:00]** one combat. So your acolytes can actually declare battles themselves or contribute to battles that

**[13:06]** they're in. Black Goat acolytes are not your typical acolytes. They're actually, they're down

**[13:11]** to party. They're also down to get into fights. Another unit for the Black Goat, the first Black

**[13:19]** Goat monster, that is the Ghoul. They're little tiny guys. They actually have zero combat and they cost

**[13:27]** you one Power to summon. This is our first zero combat monster that we've talked about on this

**[13:33]** podcast. So just a quick PSA. Don't forget your Ghouls are still useful for defending against

**[13:38]** monsters even though they can't roll any dice by themselves. The Spellbook that works with the Ghouls

**[13:45]** is Necrophagy, which lets your Ghouls enter into an area where there was a battle after the battle

**[13:53]** takes place and paint out additional units. This is a super handy book. We'll talk more about that in

**[14:00]** detail once I get to Spellbooks. If you're wondering about Ghouls and where they might be from, I would

**[14:06]** say the Ghouls are from the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath story. Basically the Ghouls tend to hang out

**[14:13]** in graveyards on earth and graveyards are where there are Gates leading to the Dreamlands, specifically

**[14:19]** the underworld. Read the Dream Quest to Unknown Kadath by H.P. Lovecraft. I'm sure I'll talk about that one

**[14:28]** again. I'm planning to do a whole episode on the Dreamlands map and I think I'll also maybe release

**[14:35]** it alongside the Dreamlands surface monsters and the underworld monsters. I'll kind of maybe do like

**[14:41]** a three-part release there. Going on to the next monster for Black Goat, that is the Fungi from Yoggoth.

**[14:49]** They cost you two Power to summon naturally and they have one combat. They look very gross. It looks like

**[14:57]** they have a kind of a crab thing going on. They might be holding somebody's brain in their arms.

**[15:05]** Pretty gross. Wouldn't want to run into one if I were taking a walk. Very gross sculpt. Very cool.

**[15:12]** They've got some tentacles around the mouth too now that I'm looking really closely at this.

**[15:16]** The Spellbook that goes with Fungi from Yoggoth is Groth. Kind of a complicated Spellbook. I'm not sure I even

**[15:22]** want to get into it here. Groth is basically going to have people eliminate acolytes depending on

**[15:28]** how many unique areas you have Fungi in. You have four Fungi in your pool. So if you have Fungi in all

**[15:36]** four areas, that's when you want to be using Groth. More on Groth very shortly. The last monster from

**[15:43]** the Black Goat is the Dark Young. They cost three Power naturally to summon. They have two combat.

**[15:53]** They are very gross tripods. They've got lots of tentacles. They've got lots of mouths. Very

**[16:00]** suggestive looking mouths there. And there's more than one. There's like three. Got a little bit of a

**[16:06]** hoof thing going on because they're supposed to be with the Black Goat. Very gross. Very cool.

**[16:09]** So the Spellbook that works with Dark Young is Red Sign. And that actually makes the Dark Young

**[16:15]** able to build and stand on Gates and generate Power for you in Gather Power, which is really,

**[16:21]** really cool and unique. More on Red Sign shortly. Lastly, we've got Shub. She's the Black Goat of the

**[16:31]** Woods. Really, really cool sculpt. Really disgusting, kind of bloated goat thing. Lots of hooves, lots of

**[16:38]** tentacles, lots of, I don't know, eyes, pimples, nice little tail. Awakening Shub, how do you do it?

**[16:46]** She costs eight Power to awaken. You need to have a controlled Gate, and you need to have at least

**[16:50]** two Cultists on the map. They can be in any areas. You pay eight Power, and you have to remove two of

**[16:57]** your Cultists and then place Shub at your controlled Gate. So those Cultists are going to go back to your

**[17:03]** pool. As we've discussed in another episode, having Cultists in your pool is actually pretty

**[17:08]** useful thing to have, and Black Goat's very good at putting Cultists back in their own pool.

**[17:14]** Her combat is equal to the total of your Cultists plus your controlled Gates, and if you have the

**[17:20]** red sign, you also get plus one for every Dark Young in play. Oof, calculating the combat on this one is a

**[17:26]** little bit more difficult than your average faction. Shub can actually roll a lot of dice if you have all of

**[17:33]** your plastic on the board. That's important to keep in mind. Shub has the ability Avatar, which is an

**[17:39]** action that costs you one Power, and you choose an area and a faction in that area. You swap the

**[17:45]** location of Shub and a monster or Cultist in the area chosen by the faction owner. This is one of the

**[17:52]** strongest movement abilities in the game, in my opinion. You can do all kinds of shenanigans in the

**[17:58]** early game here. If people are building Gates early on, they're not going to really have the Power to

**[18:04]** defend them super well. Avatar is really, really easy to pick off remote Gates. It doesn't matter how far

**[18:12]** away a Gate is. Avatar can get you there with the quickness. You can Avatar other factions. They pick what

**[18:18]** is getting swapped back into Shub's area, so that's important to keep in mind. Make sure you have a monster

**[18:25]** guarding your Gate. If you're going to swap and you think they're going to swap a monster into your

**[18:29]** area, make sure you don't get captured as a result. Avatar is going to be one of your primary tools for

**[18:36]** getting into more areas. Just swapping with somebody, stealing their Gate. Maybe you're then recruiting an

**[18:43]** acolyte into the area you just avatared into. Then you avatar again somewhere else. Just avataring twice

**[18:50]** with maybe a recruit in between that will put you into three areas and you weren't even trying.

**[18:56]** This is a good way to start out strong and get into those four areas there. Another thing to remember

**[19:03]** with avatar, typically you'll use this on other players and their stuff, but you can actually avatar

**[19:09]** with yourself as well. That's important to keep in mind if you are avataring into remote areas and you

**[19:15]** actually don't have acolytes in your pool. Let's set up an example here. You've avatared into the

**[19:22]** Arctic Ocean or something. Maybe there's a Windwalker there and they have like Rantagoth and

**[19:28]** one acolyte. You avatar with them. Notably, it says monster or cultus, so you'll never get a great old

**[19:36]** one swapped into your area. It can only be monster or cultus. If there's a great old one and one acolyte

**[19:42]** on a Gate somewhere, if you avatar them, they have to swap their acolyte and they're stuck with their

**[19:48]** great old one there. I recommend doing that when somebody's out of Power. Anyway, if you do swap with

**[19:54]** them, let's go with this example. There's Ran, there's an acolyte in the Arctic Ocean. You swap,

**[20:02]** they put their acolytes back in West Africa where you have the rest of your acolytes and then Shub

**[20:08]** is in the area with Ran. If you don't have an acolyte in your pool, but you have a bunch of them

**[20:12]** hanging out in West Africa, you can avatar with yourself in West Africa and just swap Shub with

**[20:18]** one of your acolytes. Doing that, you've then like put Shub back into safety and then you've also put

**[20:25]** one of your acolytes onto a Gate that was going to be two or three or four Power worth of moving to get

**[20:31]** over there. So that's a really handy way to save Power on moving your units and putting them into

**[20:37]** a nice position. I think we're ready to get into the Black Goat Spellbooks. I got them here in front

**[20:46]** of me. I mentioned the book that works with the Black Goat acolytes is Blood Sacrifice. It says,

**[20:52]** if Shub is in play during the Doom phase, you can choose to eliminate one of your Cultists from

**[20:57]** anywhere on the map. And if you do, you get one Elder Sign. This book is deceptively strong if you

**[21:04]** get it really early in the game. Later, I'll kind of give you the elevator pitch on why I think getting

**[21:10]** this one in action phase one is one of the best things that you can do because you're going to

**[21:14]** want to use this every turn. If you're managing to play a whole game as Black Goat and get this book

**[21:19]** early, you may get like three or four Elder Signs basically for free just by Shub existing with Blood

**[21:26]** Sacrifice. And that can really, really add up. If you'll recall, Elder Signs are like an average of

**[21:32]** 1.67 Doom. So if you're earning three or four Elder Signs over the course of the game, that's probably

**[21:39]** like five or six Doom on average. And when you think about trying to reach 30 Doom at the end of the game,

**[21:45]** that's nearly 20% of your Doom that you really didn't have to work for in any way. That's one of

**[21:51]** the books I prioritize getting first because it's just very easy to throw away your Acolytes,

**[21:56]** getting Acolytes into your pool every turn. So if you need to get to a new area, if you need to

**[22:01]** recruit somewhere on a Gate that you've just conquered, Blood Sacrifice is going to help you

**[22:05]** do that every action phase. Let's also talk about Frenzy. This is an ongoing ability. It's very simple.

**[22:12]** It just says your Cultists now have a combat value of one. Wow. So your Cultists can actually declare

**[22:19]** combat as Black Goat. That's pretty spicy. It makes it so that whenever you do start turtling up with

**[22:26]** Shub in one area, if you have a bunch of your Acolytes, remember your Acolytes contribute to

**[22:31]** Shub's combat. If you also have Frenzy, people really aren't going to want to come into an area

**[22:36]** with Shub and five Acolytes and declare combat. That's going to be five combat on Shub plus five

**[22:42]** from the Acolytes just by themselves. There's a bunch of bodies there. You're rolling like 10 plus dice.

**[22:47]** That's not counting any Dark Young you may have laying around. Frenzy also pairs really well with,

**[22:54]** I guess that's a good segue, Frenzy can pair really well with Necrophagy. Necrophagy is our

**[23:01]** post-battle ability Spellbook that works with our Ghouls. It says that you can move any or all Ghouls

**[23:08]** who are not involved in a battle from any area into the battle area. For each Ghoul that you move,

**[23:14]** both sides in the battle suffer an additional pain result. Black Goat has two Ghouls, so you can apply

**[23:21]** up to two additional pains every time you use Necrophagy. This is in any battle in any area on

**[23:28]** the map, even if you are not involved. Your Ghouls are extremely, extremely mobile. This Spellbook is

**[23:34]** really, really strong. One of your best tools in order to get into those additional areas safely.

**[23:40]** You don't really want to be moving your acolytes into those areas necessarily to spread out. The

**[23:46]** Ghouls will do it for you. They'll also push everybody away. Really basic Necrophagy example.

**[23:52]** Crawling Chaos. Sorry, there I go with Crawling Chaos. And I don't know. Crawling Chaos and Windwalker

**[23:58]** decide to punch each other in the face in some random Gate you're nowhere near. There's not that

**[24:04]** many units there. Maybe there's like, I don't know, a couple of pains rolled on each side. There would be

**[24:09]** some units left over, but you've got Necrophagy. So you bring in your Ghouls. You give two additional

**[24:14]** pains. Everybody needs to leave the area. Now everyone's like fully pained out of the area.

**[24:19]** You as Black Goat, you've got two monsters in the area. On your next action, it's pretty easy for you

**[24:24]** to just recruit an acolyte there and boom, you like already control a Gate and you have monsters guarding

**[24:29]** the Gate. If anybody who was just fighting over that Gate wants it, they're going to have to not only

**[24:34]** move back in, but also fight you in order to get you off there or try to capture you.

**[24:41]** This book is just really, really strong. Can't really say that enough. It's going to be useful

**[24:45]** for you getting all of your spell books, like I said, spreading out, but also even after you have

**[24:50]** all of your books, it's just going to make it so easy for you to pick up any Gates that anybody fights

**[24:56]** over that are not heavily defended. They might as well be your Gates. Every time somebody fights,

**[25:01]** you just bring in your Ghouls every battle, it's going to be very annoying for people because

**[25:06]** you're just going to result in them not only having to move in and battle, but then maybe like

**[25:09]** move back in afterward because the Ghouls pained everybody out. Okay, moving on to the next spell

**[25:16]** book, that is the Red Sign. This is an ongoing ability. Dark Young can create Gates. They can

**[25:22]** control Gates. They also add one to Shub's combat and they provide you one Power during gather Power,

**[25:29]** just like a Cultist. They don't act like Cultists for any other reason. So like Dark Young can't be

**[25:35]** captured, for example, except by Capture Monster. This is a really crazy ability. There's no ability

**[25:41]** really like this in the game. Dark Young, they typically cost you three Power. I keep saying

**[25:46]** they normally cost you this much Power. That will make more sense in a minute. Dark Young are kind of

**[25:52]** expensive. They have decent combat. They have two combats, but really this ability is where they

**[25:57]** really shine. You've got your six acolytes as Black Goat, but once you have the Red Sign,

**[26:03]** you really are having nine units that produce Power and nine units that can build and control Gates.

**[26:10]** Just having all your acolytes in play at gather Power and all of your Dark Young, that's nine Power

**[26:17]** right there without you having to control any Gates. That's like a huge deal. If you're ever in a

**[26:22]** position where you're just like totally dominating as Black Goat, you can get above that theoretical

**[26:27]** six Gate cap that other factions have. So it's not impossible for the Black Goat player to get

**[26:32]** between seven and nine Gates. Hopefully that never happens. If it does, you've probably lost the game

**[26:38]** if Black Goat ever gets to seven or eight Gates. Just keep in mind it's a possibility.

**[26:44]** The other handy thing about this ability, the Dark Young can create Gates. When we're thinking about

**[26:50]** spreading out, getting into those additional areas as Black Goat, the Dark Young are actually a good unit

**[26:56]** to send out into the new area because they're not going to get captured. They can also build a Gate,

**[27:02]** so you don't need to like expose your acolytes to capture when you could instead have Red Sign and

**[27:07]** move your Dark Young into a nice spot instead. Last thing about Red Sign, it's just annoying for your

**[27:15]** opponents to have to deal with Dark Young, which are controlling Gates. They're just stickier than an

**[27:21]** acolyte on a Gate, and they're just a great deterrent. Your opponents really are going to think twice

**[27:25]** about moving into a Gate with a Dark Young and several acolytes. They're not going to be able to

**[27:30]** capture in order to take that Gate. They're going to have to declare a battle, and if you got Frenzy

**[27:35]** and like a couple of just a couple of acolytes and a Dark Young, that's going to be four or five dice

**[27:41]** that you're rolling against them. It's just kind of more trouble than it's worth to grab those Gates.

**[27:45]** Defensively, Red Sign is really strong. Once Black Goat gets entrenched in some areas with Dark Young,

**[27:52]** several acolytes, maybe a Fungi or two, those Gates are just become very undesirable for your

**[27:57]** opponents to come take from you. Let's talk about Thousand Young. This is another spa book. It's an

**[28:05]** ongoing ability. If Shabba's in play, Ghouls, Fungi, and Dark Young cost you each one less Power to

**[28:13]** summon. This is why I've been saying that caveat every time I've mentioned Black Goat's monsters.

**[28:18]** They typically cost this much. Mostly, you're going to have the Thousand Young. They're actually

**[28:22]** going to cost one less, so that's a huge deal. That means your Ghouls, instead of costing one Power,

**[28:28]** they cost zero Power. If you remember from our previous episode about staggering the Power that

**[28:33]** you're spending, if you've not summoned your Ghouls and they cost you zero Power, that's two actions

**[28:37]** worth of you getting to do nothing. That's awesome. That's like two turns worth of stalling.

**[28:42]** Your Fungi costs one Power, so that's great. Now they have one combat, one cost. That's a really

**[28:49]** good rate. One cost actions are really cheap. That's also really nice. Lastly, there's the Dark Young.

**[28:56]** That initial Power of three to spend is kind of steep. If you can manage to get Thousand Young before you

**[29:02]** summon any Dark Young, well, you're going to be saving one Power on them, and then they're also going

**[29:06]** to be providing you one Power, so they're going to pay for themselves a little bit more quickly than they

**[29:11]** normally would. Very useful Spellbook. This is also a really nice one to get early on in the game if you

**[29:18]** want to get your Ghouls on the cheap, kind of keep everybody guessing what you're going to do next.

**[29:22]** I'll talk more about that in the opening strategies for Black Goat, but this Spellbook is very,

**[29:28]** very awesome. One of the stronger Spellbooks that Black Goat has. The last of our Black Goat Spellbooks

**[29:35]** is going to be Groth. This one's a doozy. Roll one die. You got a special Groth die for Black Goat.

**[29:43]** It's just a d6. Roll one die. If the result is equal to or less than the number of areas containing Fungi,

**[29:50]** your enemies must eliminate Cultists equal to the roll between them. They've got one minute to decide

**[29:56]** how many each must lose. If they can't agree, you choose four of them. If the result is higher than the

**[30:02]** number of areas with Fungi, that'd be like a five or a six at maximum. Place an Acolyte from any faction

**[30:09]** anywhere on the map. A lot to unpack with this Spellbook. So firstly, it's not going to do anything

**[30:16]** for you if you don't have any Fungi, so you're going to want to have at least one Fungi. I would recommend

**[30:22]** not ever using this Spellbook unless you have the full maximum of all four of your Fungi in four

**[30:28]** different areas. And that's mainly because this ability can fail even when you've like got it at

**[30:34]** maximum strength. If you roll a five or a six, it will fail. Notably, like if this ability fails,

**[30:40]** you must place an Acolyte from somebody's pool if it's available. If you don't have any Acolytes in

**[30:45]** your pool, you're going to have to place someone from somebody else. The good news is that it can be

**[30:50]** in any area, so if Cthulhu has an Acolyte in their pool, you can freely just place it somewhere they

**[30:56]** don't want, like in the home area of the Chocho or something where Ubo can do a capture. Let's say

**[31:03]** we don't fail though. You're going to roll a die, and that die is going to land between one and four.

**[31:09]** That's going to be how much Cultists the other players need to eliminate. They've got a minute

**[31:15]** to do that, so it's a little bit like Thousand Forms. I find that people don't often come to an

**[31:22]** agreement on this one. Typically, everyone is asking the Black Goat player when they groth. If

**[31:27]** they groth for a four, they're going to ask Black Goat, like, hey, what's up? Like, who are you going

**[31:31]** to use that on? More often than the players cooperating with each other. If you're using groth,

**[31:37]** certain factions it is better against than others. What do I mean by that? One faction I think groth is

**[31:45]** really strong against is Sleeper, because they typically like to hang around and wait till everybody's

**[31:51]** out of Power with Lethargy. If you groth them and you make them give up four of their Acolytes,

**[31:57]** you know, with assuming the other players don't want to help make that not happen, losing four

**[32:02]** Acolytes is pretty significant. They'll have to spend four Power recruiting them, and that's four

**[32:07]** less Power they have to spend on moving and taking people's Gates after everybody else is out of Power.

**[32:13]** Quick PSA on the opposite case. A faction where groth is not effective at all would be Demon Sultan.

**[32:20]** You never ever want to use groth while Demon Sultan is in the game. That's because Demon Sultan has

**[32:26]** ability Psychosis that lets them place their Acolytes for zero Power where there's no units in

**[32:32]** the area. Demon Sultan is going to love to give up four Acolytes, because that means like four turns

**[32:37]** of stalling and paying zero Power. You don't really want to ever give them that. More on that in my

**[32:43]** Demon Sultan guide that will be coming at some point.

**[32:45]** One other faction you want to be aware of on a lower groth roll that could backfire on you a

**[32:51]** little bit would be Yellow Sign, because they have Passion. Losing Acolytes to groth does count as an

**[32:57]** elimination, so just be careful you don't accidentally give Yellow Sign one Power and let them relocate one

**[33:04]** of their Acolytes on a recruit in a later turn. That being said, the high groth roll is going to work

**[33:10]** just fine on Yellow Sign. If they have to give up four Acolytes, the way Passion works, it's every

**[33:15]** instance of losing units, so if they give up four Acolytes, they're only going to gain one Power back

**[33:19]** from Passion. Groth is going to be most useful against any faction that is on many Gates but

**[33:26]** spread kind of thin. So think about any faction that is on like four or five or six Gates. Groth's

**[33:31]** going to be really strong because they're not going to have multiple Acolytes at every Gate. If you hit a

**[33:36]** four, the other players are going to be super down to like not give any Cultists up. If you tell them

**[33:41]** like before you groth, hey, don't offer up any Cultists because I'm going to make, I don't know,

**[33:46]** I'm going to make Windwalker, who's on four Gates, give up four Cultists. Everyone's going to be like,

**[33:50]** that sounds great. If things go according to plan, you spent two Power. Windwalker lost four Acolytes

**[33:56]** and probably lost control of multiple Gates, which is really, really strong. Groth is just a,

**[34:02]** it's just a very strange ability. When do you want to really use Groth? When you're on low Power,

**[34:08]** I don't really recommend using Groth. I like find it the most useful when you have had a good turn

**[34:15]** as Black Goat and maybe you have like the highest amount of Power of anybody. You can really start

**[34:20]** suppressing the other players. If you've got six or eight Power to spare and you can Groth successfully

**[34:25]** like three or four times, it's going to be pretty rough for the other players to like get anything done.

**[34:31]** Everyone's just going to be losing their Acolytes left and right. They're going to have to spend their

**[34:34]** Power just to like recruit and maintain control of their Gates and that's Power that they can't spend

**[34:39]** on like coming and punching you. Okay, so we've pretty much finished with our faction overview of

**[34:47]** Black Goat at this point and now we can move on to Black Goat openings. This is going to be my favorite

**[34:53]** part of the guide and that's because I feel like this faction just has so many shenanigans that you can

**[34:59]** go for way more than other factions. There's just a lot of different a lot of play to how you can open

**[35:04]** up the game. I'm going to talk long form about all these. This is my favorite faction so sorry.

**[35:10]** Starting in action phase one, one very significant difference between Black Goat and other factions

**[35:16]** is that you actually have enough Power to awaken your great old one on action phase one. You'll have

**[35:22]** exactly eight Power. Shub costs exactly eight Power to awaken. Yes, you'll have to give up two Acolytes.

**[35:29]** Yes, you'll be out of Power after doing so. Yes, the following action phase you'll be down two Acolytes

**[35:35]** so you'll only have six Power to work with but I'm here to tell you as someone who considers themselves

**[35:40]** a Black Goat main, I think this is like one of if not the strongest ways to open as the Black Goat

**[35:46]** and that's because whenever I wake up Shub action phase one, I will 99% of the time be taking

**[35:53]** Blood Sacrifice. In action phase two, you're going to be on six Power and you're going to have only

**[36:00]** four Acolytes. You're going to want to give up one and so you'll only have three starting the action

**[36:05]** phase but you will get an Elder Sign. The reason I like this opening so much is imagine like everybody

**[36:13]** else in a typical game is going to you know build a Gate so all the players are going to be on two

**[36:17]** Gates. That means in the Doom phase all the players are going to get two Doom. Even though you didn't

**[36:22]** build a second Gate, you're still getting an Elder Sign for giving up an Acolyte. Even if that Elder

**[36:27]** Sign is a one, it's as though you are on at least two Gates just like all the other players. If that Elder

**[36:33]** Sign is like a two or a three, you're actually ahead of all the other players just from giving up one

**[36:38]** Acolyte. That alone to me is just incredibly strong. If you can keep Shub alive the whole game,

**[36:45]** that's going to be four Elder Signs over the course of the game. That's going to really add up to

**[36:50]** pumping up your Doom total and making it so that you can like actually run away with the game and win.

**[36:55]** We should talk about action phase two as well. In action phase two here, you've got only three

**[37:00]** Acolytes after the Doom phase because you gave one up. You've only got six Power to work with,

**[37:04]** that's not a lot. So you might be thinking like, why would I have done that? I just kind

**[37:08]** put myself in a bad spot in action phase two. I actually don't think you did. Most people are

**[37:14]** going to be taking the second action phase off in order to awaken their great old ones. That's

**[37:19]** really awesome for you as Black Goat. That means there's going to be some number of Gates out there

**[37:24]** that are going to be like vulnerable to you using Avatar. So that's going to like let you get into

**[37:30]** more areas and let you maybe get an additional Gate or get some captures going. One thing I really

**[37:37]** like to do after awakening Shub on action phase one and taking Blood Sacrifice is in action phase two

**[37:44]** as my action eliminate two Cultists from any area on the map. This is wild. So at this point,

**[37:50]** I like to do that first thing. So at that point, you are have six Power, you only have one Acolyte

**[37:56]** and Shub on your West Africa Gate. Seems like a little bit sketchy, but people are taking the turn

**[38:02]** off. No one's really going to have the resources to like come and bother you. Once you've given up

**[38:07]** your two Acolytes, I will usually take Thousand Young. That's going to make all your monsters cost

**[38:13]** one less. So remember that will make your Ghouls cost nothing. Yes, you'll have less Power than the

**[38:19]** other players. You'll have six Power, but you'll have two whole turns worth of summon a Ghoul for zero

**[38:24]** Power and do nothing while the other players are going to have to spend their Power. That's going to put

**[38:28]** you into a spot where at least one player, maybe more, are going to have no Power while you've just

**[38:34]** been sitting there stalling. It's going to make them vulnerable to Avatar and it's just going to

**[38:39]** make it way easier for you to go and steal their Gates. This is actually a very easy way to, in

**[38:45]** action phase two, although you don't have any units in play hardly, you'll be able to get into four

**[38:50]** areas. You might also be able to get your share areas with all enemies and gain Power back. So you've

**[38:56]** turned like a sort of sketchy looking position into a really strong position where you've got

**[39:04]** multiple Spellbook requirements in one action phase, like four areas and share all areas,

**[39:09]** and you've gained the Power back. With this opening, not only do you like keep pace with the other

**[39:13]** players in terms of doom, but you may also start action phase three in a really strong spot where you

**[39:19]** stole multiple Gates and you're starting the turn yourself on like three Gates instead of on one Gate.

**[39:25]** The only thing I have to say about this opening is you might have pissed people off by doing that,

**[39:31]** by stealing their Gates so early on. They might be coming after you. Just be mindful of that.

**[39:37]** The good news is that if you did all this, you should also have the most Power, so you should

**[39:41]** have plenty of Power laying around to defend your Gates in action phase three. If you still want those

**[39:47]** early Elder Signs, but you want to be nice, the polite thing to do with your six Power would just be

**[39:53]** to re-recruit three acolytes and summon a Dark Young. That way you'll be at eight Power next time,

**[39:59]** and you'll still be getting those extra Elder Signs, but hopefully no one should be mad at you.

**[40:04]** I really think this is the strongest start only because getting those extra Elder Signs from blood

**[40:10]** sacrifice as soon as possible, ideally for every doom phase, is going to be really paying off for you

**[40:15]** in terms of doom later. Black goat has a lot of what I would call the quote-unquote standard openings.

**[40:24]** Move, build a Gate, you've got all kinds of different costed monsters that you can summon

**[40:28]** in order to protect all of your Gates. I don't have too much to say on this opening. I would just think

**[40:33]** carefully about which of your first Spellbooks you're going to take. If you want to prioritize

**[40:37]** summoning Dark Young to protect your Gates, I would consider red sign. Your Dark Young are going to start

**[40:42]** producing Power earlier, and that means they're going to pay for themselves earlier. If you want

**[40:48]** to use your Ghouls to help you spread out, I would take Necrophagia as one of your earlier books.

**[40:53]** One advantage to the standard approach is you'll be in two areas on action phase two, and you're

**[40:58]** already setting yourself up to get into four areas by just playing the game and letting it happen

**[41:03]** naturally. You could do the three Gate opening, of course. That's going to make it so that you're in

**[41:08]** almost your four areas. Just be really careful about the three Gate opening when anybody like

**[41:14]** Crawling Chaos with Flight is in the game, or don't do three Gates when anybody is close by to you,

**[41:20]** because you just don't want to give them a free Gate and sabotage yourself by getting your acolyte

**[41:25]** captured, and then you're all of a sudden only in two areas when you're meant to be in almost four areas.

**[41:32]** One last thing I'll say about the three Gate opening is you actually,

**[41:35]** if you can hide the fact that you're going for it, you have a couple of different ways to transition

**[41:40]** out of it. What do I mean by hiding it? That all comes back to that concept of staggering,

**[41:45]** how slowly or quickly you spend your Power that we talked about in the intermediate advanced tactics

**[41:50]** episode. You could move and then build a Gate and then move again. If you did that, everybody's

**[41:56]** going to know that you have committed to building a Gate, and they're going to know you're either going

**[42:01]** to build a third Gate, or you're going to move away or summon a monster or something. Moving an

**[42:06]** acolyte as your first two actions is going to hide the fact that you're going for three Gates for the

**[42:10]** longest possible time. So you've got two acolytes in position to build Gates. From there, you can build

**[42:16]** your first Gate, and if anybody tries to intercept you from building your second Gate or coming to your

**[42:21]** new Gate, you can always just take your Spellbook requirement of giving up two acolytes for a book.

**[42:27]** That's going to give you a couple turns to recruit. You're not going to get the three Gates, but you

**[42:31]** might avoid getting your acolytes captured. Moving two acolytes into two different areas at the start

**[42:37]** of the game is also going to segue nicely into our last opening. The last opening I can talk about,

**[42:44]** which I saw pioneered by KP on the Discord server. Shout out to KP in Australia. Really good Black Goat

**[42:52]** player. I've never seen anybody else play Black Goat quite the same way. Quick plug, KP also has made a

**[42:58]** game called Scrap you should check out. Anywho, the Frenzy opening. What are you going to do here?

**[43:04]** We're going to take Frenzy as one of our first Spellbooks. This opening involves moving an acolyte,

**[43:09]** building a Gate, and then you're maybe going to like move two other acolytes to get into four areas.

**[43:15]** At this point, you're going to take the Frenzy Spellbook.

**[43:18]** With your last remaining Power, probably you're going to summon two Ghouls for the standard cost

**[43:25]** of one Power. In the next action phase, or sooner if you feel, you can take your Spellbook requirement

**[43:32]** to eliminate two Cultists, and with that one you're going to want to take Necrophagy. So at this point

**[43:39]** we're in action phase two. People are going to be taking the turn off to summon their great old ones.

**[43:44]** That's great for you. You can start moving your acolytes into people's Gates and declaring a battle.

**[43:51]** It doesn't even matter if your acolyte with one combat gets killed, that's totally fine.

**[43:56]** Mainly you want to be doing this because you then get to bring in both your Ghouls and kind of like

**[44:00]** bully them off the Gate. Even without Necrophagy, you might be able to find a Gate that's so lightly

**[44:06]** defended that just declaring a battle a couple of times and rolling any kind of results with your

**[44:11]** acolytes is enough. Combined with Necrophagy, this opening can be very potent. If people are not

**[44:17]** having a bunch of plastic where their Gates are, you're going to be able to push them off Gates very

**[44:22]** easily. Yes, you give up Awakening Shub early, which I've got significant concerns about, but instead

**[44:30]** this opening is going to let you get from, you know, four to six to eight areas quickly

**[44:35]** while getting Gates from people, while staggering your Power spending. Practice the frenzy opening,

**[44:42]** I would say, before you do it because this one can embarrass you a little bit if somebody does

**[44:48]** decide to just capture you. You don't really want to get into that spot because you've lost an area

**[44:53]** on your way to getting six and eight areas, which you never ever want to do.

**[44:57]** Maybe we can talk a little bit about like a Dark Young opening as well. Maybe we're staying on one

**[45:07]** Gate and we summon two Dark Young and we sacrifice two Cultists and then we immediately get the Red

**[45:15]** Sign book. That's going to make it so that even though we gave up those acolytes, yeah, okay,

**[45:21]** in the following phase we still get Power from our Dark Young. We're going to be at eight Power anyway.

**[45:25]** That just kind of sets us up so that our Dark Young are going to be starting to provide us Power

**[45:30]** earlier on in the game as long as those stay around. That can set us up better for Action Phase

**[45:35]** 2, Action Phase 3, moving your Dark Young into the new areas and building a Gate there. It's going to

**[45:41]** be a safe way for you to expand, again, without having Shub in play, but you will be generating the

**[45:46]** extra Power from Dark Young, so I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that opening as well.

**[45:51]** So I think I've covered many of the typical openings for Black Goat, so now we can move into talking

**[45:58]** about general tips and tricks, how to play Black Goat, how to not play Black Goat mainly, and how to

**[46:04]** thwart Black Goat. Starting with how to play Black Goat. I've mentioned this several times, the timing of

**[46:10]** spreading out your units in Black Goat is key. If you spread your units out too fast, you're going to be

**[46:15]** your own worst enemy, you're going to sabotage yourself. If you put your acolytes into a spot

**[46:22]** where they can get captured, a good player is just going to do that. You can easily lock a Black Goat

**[46:26]** player out of getting their 8 areas Spellbook just by capturing an acolyte hero there where they

**[46:33]** shouldn't have put one. That's their bad. You have multiple action phases to get into a position where

**[46:39]** you have all of your Spellbooks, so don't rush the spreading. It's totally normal, and I would say

**[46:44]** even preferable to maybe get one of each of those Spellbooks during an action phase. In action phase

**[46:52]** 2, get to 4 areas. Don't try to get into 6 areas. It's not worth it. In action phase 3, maybe you can

**[46:59]** consider getting into 6 and 8 areas, and then I'd also consider trying to share areas with all of your

**[47:05]** enemies. Once you get into 8 areas though, that's when I would consider your mission complete. The other

**[47:11]** Spellbooks are practically free. You're going to wake up Shob obviously, and then as I stated earlier,

**[47:17]** you can just use your Spellbook requirement to eliminate 2 of your Cultists on the map.

**[47:22]** Get them back into your pool, back into safety after you've gotten into 8 areas. That's like ideally

**[47:27]** what you want to do. Just don't get captured, you'll be your own worst enemy if you do. Shob is your most

**[47:34]** valuable asset. She's going to be giving you free Elder Signs from blood sacrifice. She's going to be

**[47:39]** enabling you to avatar around the board, but her summoning costs are, or her awakening costs rather,

**[47:44]** are pretty steep. You really want to avoid losing Shob, if at all possible. It's definitely possible

**[47:50]** to come back and win after losing Shob one time, but if you've lost Shob twice, you might have a hard

**[47:56]** time getting to 30 doom and winning the game. Do avatar earlier on in the game in order to like steal

**[48:02]** those Gates from people, get to the vulnerable areas, but as soon as people start getting unlimited

**[48:07]** combat, it becomes way sketchier to avatar around, so I would just be mindful of that. Be mindful of

**[48:13]** Dread Curse of Azathoth from Opener of the Way. Be really careful about avataring if Opener's in play.

**[48:19]** They would love to just snipe Shob with rolling like three or four dice on a Dread Curse, and you don't

**[48:24]** want that. I don't really have too much to add about thwarting Black Goat. I've kind of already said it.

**[48:31]** If you're playing Black Goat, you may be your own worst enemy, and you may be the one who's most in

**[48:35]** position to sabotage yourself by making a bad move. Stagger your Power moving your units. That's just a

**[48:43]** good rule of thumb in general for Cthulhu Wars. Definitely for Black Goat, moving into the extra

**[48:47]** areas, take your time. Except maybe when you get into that spot where you want to move into your

**[48:52]** eighth area. I'm actually totally cool spending like two or three Power just moving into those

**[48:57]** additional areas and getting those books. Once you get eight areas, you can then start to like

**[49:01]** consolidate your forces. Reducting Shob is of utmost importance. So this is like once everybody

**[49:07]** gets unlimited combat, you want an area that's just very safe, lots of bodies, lots of combat dice,

**[49:12]** where Shob can just vibe and not have to worry about getting sniped by any great old ones.

**[49:19]** Thwarting Black Goat is, I'd say, very simple. Just denying those areas books, if you can,

**[49:26]** is really what you want to be doing. Any opportunities to capture their acolytes as

**[49:30]** they're starting to spread out is a great thing to do. And then, as I've been saying, Shob is like

**[49:34]** the MVP, so any opportunity you have to take Shob out is something you should probably highly consider.

**[49:41]** If you take out Shob, that's Blood Sacrifice not working, and that's going to make it so that you

**[49:45]** can outpace the Black Goat player in terms of Doom. They're going to be getting less Elder Signs if

**[49:50]** Shob's not in play, so that's really the move. That also turns off Thousand Young, so if Shob's not in play,

**[49:55]** monsters are being more expensive. So that's rough for the Black Goat player as well.

**[50:00]** I think that's about all I have for my guide on Black Goat. I hope you found this guide useful.

**[50:07]** I really appreciate you for listening. Thank you everybody who has listened to this cast already,

**[50:12]** who's given me any kind of feedback. I really appreciate it. I'm hoping to keep putting these

**[50:17]** out and hoping that the quality will continue to increase as I get better at not only recording,

**[50:22]** but also editing. Just having done this process end-to-end is going to be easier and easier for me

**[50:27]** going forward. So I would also really appreciate, let me make sure I get the phrase right that they say

**[50:32]** in other podcasts, rate, review, and subscribe if you can. That would be cool. Tell your Cthulhu Wars

**[50:38]** playing friends about this cast. I would love to get more people listening, and as always, I'll be

**[50:43]** linking in every description, but do join the Cthulhu Wars Discord, where we play games on Tabletop

**[50:49]** Simulator. I would love to chat with you or play a game with you. I'm still considering other things

**[50:54]** for this podcast, like setting up an email. I'll probably set up a Gmail at some point, like

**[50:58]** openingthewayatgmail.com, so that you can get in touch with me and ask me questions. Otherwise,

**[51:03]** you can get in touch with me on Discord if you find me at Kilogram. Feel free to send me a message.

**[51:08]** I'd love to hear from you. And yeah, with that said, we'll leave it there. So thanks for listening.

**[51:13]** Appreciate you. Have a nice day. Have a nice evening. Have a nice morning, wherever it is that you are.

**[51:17]** Thanks. Bye.
