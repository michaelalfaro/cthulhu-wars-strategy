## Transcript

**[00:00]** The Revelations of Glacky has been reprinted elsewhere according to notes, or perhaps I'd

**[00:06]** better say pirated. This, however, is the only complete edition. The man who managed to copy it

**[00:12]** down and escaped to get it printed didn't dare copy it all down for publication. The original

**[00:18]** handwritten version is completely fragmentary. It's written by the different members of a cult,

**[00:24]** and where one member leaves off, another begins.

**[00:30]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:48]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host. Hope you're doing well, wherever you are. I'm recording

**[00:55]** this on a Friday morning before work, wishing it would be a little warmer. It seems like

**[01:02]** Halloween started to get cold where I am, and then it frosted and snowed, like, the next day.

**[01:07]** That's not great. Just had a birthday recently, and I think I had mentioned him in another episode.

**[01:15]** This guy, Francois Berenger, this French visual artist, at least I assume he's French,

**[01:20]** got the Dunwich Horror adaptation that he had made. Highly recommend, now that I have one of these in

**[01:29]** my hands. It's insane. It's a huge book. The illustrations are super, super detailed.

**[01:36]** So I'm enjoying rereading the Dunwich Horror for the umpteenth time, but this time with, like,

**[01:42]** crazy artwork to go along with it. I didn't even turn a head on any of the pages, because I

**[01:48]** don't want to spoil myself for the artwork. Looking forward to see what he has in store for

**[01:52]** all the gross stuff that ends up happening in this story.

**[01:57]** But I'm not here to talk about Francois today. We're actually here to talk about another writer

**[02:02]** who we've mentioned plenty of times on the cast already, and that would be Ramsey Campbell.

**[02:08]** This month is going to be kind of a Ramsey Campbell-centric month, and that's because we have

**[02:14]** two different expansions, neutral expansions of units having to do with stories that Ramsey Campbell has

**[02:20]** written. And we've also got a map, Shagai. It's also based on a story, The Insects from Shagai.

**[02:30]** Let's talk a little bit about Ramsey Campbell. I don't actually know all that much about him. Honestly,

**[02:35]** I didn't know who he was until I started really getting into Cthulhu Wars and exploring what's out there.

**[02:41]** Thank you, Sandy, whoever decided to include these units in the game, because yeah, I do think I

**[02:48]** stumbled upon a horror writer I really enjoy reading after making that connection.

**[02:56]** Campbell's still alive, unlike a lot of the other writers that we've discussed in the podcast to

**[03:01]** date. He's written for, it seems like, over 50 years. He has tons and tons of books, including

**[03:09]** plenty of short stories on the mythos, which is why we're talking about him today. I would definitely

**[03:15]** recommend him if you enjoy, like, a Stephen King or that kind of thing. You'll get a similar vibe from

**[03:22]** Campbell. I've read several of his, like, non-mythos novels, like notably Face That Must Die and The

**[03:30]** Parasite, which I'm looking here at his bibliography on Wikipedia. It seems like those actually came along

**[03:36]** pretty early on his career, so I've got a lot of work to do if I want to catch up on some of the other

**[03:41]** stuff he's written, but the point is, dude writes a lot, and his contributions to the mythos are,

**[03:48]** in my opinion, very, very good. A lot of the stuff I'm going to talk about today you can find in

**[03:57]** several collections of his I know of. One of them would be Inhabitant of the Lake and Other

**[04:03]** Unwelcome Tenants, and the other would be Cold Print. They share a lot of the same stories, so

**[04:10]** you've been warned maybe don't buy both of them, but there are a few that are in one and not the

**[04:15]** other. So for completeness's sake, and because I am definitely a fan of Ramsey Campbell, I've gotten

**[04:21]** both and read the entirety of each, so I think I know most of the stories associated with these units.

**[04:28]** All that being out of the way, let's just get into today's topic, which is going to be Ramsey

**[04:35]** Campbell Horror's expansion number one. This is a group of neutral units. We've got one monster,

**[04:42]** and we've got two different independent great old ones. And yeah, I'll just start talking about the

**[04:49]** first unit here. The dull noise of the pitted trapdoor beyond my line of vision echoed for a long time,

**[04:58]** yet when it ceased nothing had appeared around the curve of the cone. All that could be heard was the

**[05:03]** rustling of the unseen dweller, now mixed with the scrabbling which steadily approached. At last a shape

**[05:10]** appeared, lapping above the ground on leathery wings. The thing which flew whirring toward me was

**[05:17]** followed by a train of others, wings slapping the air at incredible speed. Even though they flew so

**[05:23]** fast, I could, with the augmented perception of terror, make out many more details than I wished.

**[05:30]** Those huge lidless eyes which stared at me, the jointed tendrils which seemed to twist from the

**[05:36]** head in cosmic rhythms, the ten legs covered in black shining tentacles and folded into the pallid

**[05:43]** underbody, and the semicircular ridged wings covered with triangular scales. All this cannot convey the

**[05:50]** soul-ripping horror of the shape which darted at me. I saw three mouths of the thing move moistly,

**[05:56]** and then it was upon me.

**[06:00]** Our first unit to discuss today is the Insects from Shagai, from the story of the same name by

**[06:08]** Ramsey Campbell. Great story, definitely give that one a read. Looking at the sculpt now, who was made by

**[06:15]** Tim Prowl. Good job, Tim. Just looks like three little, kind of almost innocuous looking, fly-looking

**[06:24]** things, but when you look closely you can see the multiple human skulls on the ground, and these things

**[06:30]** are pretty big when you take the skulls into consideration for scale. If these are human skulls,

**[06:36]** these are like about the size of a head, and that's very uncomfortable. I don't like bugs. I

**[06:42]** definitely don't like extremely large bugs. I wouldn't want to be near these too much. Tim did a

**[06:48]** good job taking exactly what was in the paragraph I just read and kind of sculpting what he sees in

**[06:54]** his mind's eye, so good job. To get the Insects from Shagai, you're going to pay two Doom to obtain

**[07:01]** their loyalty card, and then you get to place an Insects from Shagai into any area, which is a bit

**[07:06]** different than the normal text on neutral monsters, so that's spicy right off the bat. Any area you want.

**[07:13]** You have three of them in the pool, they have a cost of two, and they have a combat of zero.

**[07:19]** The ability on Insects from Shagai is Mind Parasite. It's kind of a doozy, so strap in.

**[07:26]** It's an ongoing ability. All Acolyte Cultists who are not on a Gate and share an area with an Insects

**[07:32]** from Shagai are controlled by you during the action phase, for only the following purposes.

**[07:38]** Number one, only you can move them. Number two, they fight on your side in any battle.

**[07:45]** They do not benefit from any faction Spellbooks, including yours. They can only be captured by you

**[07:51]** if their true faction permits it. They cannot be captured by their true faction, though they can

**[07:57]** be targeted by a Spellbook or killed in battle by them, etc. Once an Acolyte is no longer in the

**[08:03]** Insects area, they're free. These Cultists are not controlled by you during the gather Power or

**[08:08]** doom phases. They provide Power and doom to their true faction.

**[08:11]** So, kind of a lot to digest with this ability. I will try my best to break it down. I will say,

**[08:22]** right off the bat, this is another great example of taking the story beats, putting them mechanically

**[08:28]** into Cthulhu Wars. Great job there. I've heard this described as the most confusing unit in Cthulhu Wars,

**[08:36]** but it's very cool flavor, so read the story. Basically, you're stealing control over Acolytes

**[08:42]** that aren't on Gates, okay? But that control is a little bit limited. Like, they're not going to

**[08:47]** provide you Power. They're not going to control Gates for you. You can move them and you can fight

**[08:54]** with them on your side in the battle, which I think is the most important bit about them.

**[08:59]** One example of how to use these, if you were to move your great old one and insects into an enemy

**[09:06]** Gated area with multiple Acolytes, every Acolyte not on the Gate is going to be a body on your side

**[09:13]** of the battle. Chocho is sitting around in the corner, they have a ton of Acolytes and Ubo maybe

**[09:19]** in their area, and Crawling Chaos has bought the insects from Shigai. They can fly in with

**[09:25]** Gnarlathotep and the insects, and all of a sudden, if they battle Chocho, all the Acolytes in the area,

**[09:32]** except for one which is controlling the Gate, are going to be bodies on the Crawling Chaos end of

**[09:38]** the battle. I think that's extremely strong. It's making the other great old one there, Ubo,

**[09:44]** like very vulnerable to being killed, and on your side, just making it so that you're probably not

**[09:50]** getting killed unless they roll a really obscene number of kills. Even if they do, great, they're

**[09:57]** killing their own Cultists which you didn't have to recruit or pay for or move. Seems extremely damaging

**[10:05]** if you manage to get your enemy to roll a bunch of kills onto their own units.

**[10:11]** The ability to move the Acolytes that are in an area with insects is a bit strange to me.

**[10:20]** If you move them outside the area with the insects, you lose control of them, so that's a bit odd, but

**[10:26]** I guess I could see some cases where you might want to like move them out of the area with the insects

**[10:30]** and then into an area with another enemy who can then capture them. That's something, being diplomatic,

**[10:36]** but I don't really like spending my Power moving stuff and not getting anything out of it. I'd like

**[10:42]** to capture them myself. One other bit on these, I guess on the the capturing bit, just to clarify,

**[10:48]** they can only be captured by you if their true faction permits it. The way I'm interpreting that is

**[10:53]** you need to like meet the qualifications for the capture, if that makes sense. So like if the insects

**[10:59]** are in an area with just Acolytes, then yeah you're free to capture them. If the insects are in an

**[11:05]** area with Acolytes of your enemies and there's a monster there, you can't capture them. That makes sense

**[11:12]** to me. Hopefully that's correct. Full disclosure, I haven't played with these, partly because they are

**[11:17]** a bit complicated. I do think these are a nice flavor win. I would like to try getting these on the table

**[11:23]** at some point because they seem kind of weird. They seem like they could provoke some salt and I am always

**[11:29]** looking for units to add to a very masochistic and miserable game of Cthulhu Wars one day.

**[11:37]** What factions like the insects from Shigai? I'm thinking it's going to be mostly the offensive

**[11:43]** factions that are more mobile and able to get into those well-fortified areas. Like the Crawling Chaos

**[11:50]** example I mentioned earlier, that's a great use case. But any kind of death ball like Cthulhu or

**[11:56]** Windwalker rolling up on a heavily populated area with an insect in tow, that's going to be probably

**[12:03]** pretty devastating for the opponent because they're just going to have like multiple less bodies in the

**[12:09]** battle to soak up kills. And yeah, that's not where you want to be if you're like a Cho Cho or a yellow

**[12:14]** sign or a faction that is not great in combat. Try these out for yourself. Let me know if you have any

**[12:22]** cool stories about the insects from Shigai. Let me know if I messed up any of the rules, but I intentionally

**[12:27]** was trying not to get into specifics because I haven't played with these and they are pretty

**[12:33]** complicated. There's a lot of discussion that could be had on them. And that's all for this unit, so we

**[12:40]** will move on to another one.

**[12:45]** He fell into total darkness, screamed as his foot went down to avoid a tumble and found no floor to hold it.

**[12:52]** He fell until it seemed like he would never stop, vainly trying to catch his breath as unseen gust howled

**[12:58]** over him, down tunnels lined with a soft substance whose nature he did not care to consider.

**[13:03]** But he hit bottom at last, a circular area of some rubbery material, away from which he crawled down

**[13:10]** a passage, feeling shapes in the dark which throbbed and recoiled from his hands.

**[13:16]** He emerged in a great vault with an arched ceiling. Countless passages entered the vault and converged

**[13:22]** on a dark well in the floor. He went cold at the sight of the well, and while he yet wavered he saw

**[13:29]** bobbing white things stream out of the passages to the cavern rim and felt those which pushed him from

**[13:35]** his refuge. Then came pale movement in the well, and something clambered up from the dark, a bloated

**[13:42]** blanched oval supported on myriad fleshless legs. Eyes formed in the gelatinous oval and stared at him.

**[13:50]** And he prostrated himself as he had been told, and called the horror's name I-Hort. And under the

**[13:55]** arched roof amid the nighted tunnels, the bargain was sealed.

**[14:01]** Our second unit to discuss is the independent great old one I-Hort. Sculpted by Arnaud Bellier.

**[14:11]** Great job. Absolutely disgusting. Exactly as it's described in the story, it's just like a

**[14:18]** bulbous mass. It's got at least 10 legs, maybe 12 depending on how you count.

**[14:23]** Nasty mouth and got some eyes popping out. It just looks like a disgusting, tumory spider thing.

**[14:32]** Very unsettling. You can read about this independent great old one in the story

**[14:39]** Before the Storm by Ramsay Campbell. I think he's also mentioned in the Franklin paragraphs.

**[14:46]** I just read Before the Storm, only like a few days before recording this, and yeah,

**[14:51]** it was very disturbing and disgusting. I think like facehuggers from Alien is kind of the vibe with

**[14:58]** this great old one. I think they did a great job taking what I-Hort does to people in the story and

**[15:05]** putting it in Cthulhu Wars. Let's break down how this one actually works. To awaken I-Hort, you're going to

**[15:11]** need a controlled Gate in an area with your great old one, and you're going to pay 4 Power, placing I-Hort in

**[15:17]** the area containing the Gate. I-Hort has a combat of 0, so that's not great. However, the ability on I-Hort

**[15:26]** is extremely good. It's called the Brood, and it's ongoing. When you awaken I-Hort, immediately replace

**[15:33]** all of your accolade Cultists in play with Brood tokens. Brood tokens are Cultists with a combat of 1.

**[15:40]** They cannot take the move action, nor can they be moved by movement-like or movement-modifying

**[15:45]** abilities such as Submerge or Arctic Wind. Brood tokens can still be pained or moved by enemy abilities

**[15:52]** and Spellbooks. I'm looking at a Brood token now. It just kind of looks like some egg sacs on the ground.

**[16:00]** Don't want to know what's in there. So right off the bat, when you awaken this great old one,

**[16:08]** all of your accolade Cultists are gone and they're replaced with Broods. Broods are still Cultists, so

**[16:14]** it appears like they can control and build Gates if you want to, but they can't move, so they're a bit like

**[16:20]** the brain cylinders from the Yoggoth map in that way. You also can't move them around with any abilities,

**[16:27]** that's also fine, so just think that they're stuck to the ground, but they can still do some useful

**[16:32]** things for you being a Cultist. Importantly, they do still produce Power. That is the huge thing about

**[16:39]** this great old one and why I think it's so so good. Expanding your Cultist pool from 6 to potentially 12

**[16:49]** is a huge deal and it's just a fundamentally Powerful effect. Assuming you recruit back your

**[16:56]** Cultists when you awake IHORT, you're going to just be having way more Power every turn. You're going to

**[17:02]** be having more bodies in play that's good for you in battles. This is awesome with great old ones who

**[17:09]** might want more Cultists for whatever reason, so like a black goat or a yellow sign with passion maybe.

**[17:15]** These also have a combat of 1 notably, so they can declare battle if they need to in a pinch.

**[17:25]** Spellbook requirement for this great old one? You have at least 3 acolyte Cultists in play.

**[17:30]** That's extremely easy to do, you were planning on re-recruiting anyways because you just want to get on

**[17:35]** that sweet sweet Power train and get even more Power than normal. The Spellbook for this great old one is

**[17:42]** Unclean Bargain. In the Doom phase, if you have any brood tokens in your pool, replace your acolyte

**[17:49]** Cultists with brood tokens on a 1 for 1 basis until you either run out of acolyte Cultists on the map

**[17:55]** or brood tokens in your pool. This is not optional. Basically the Spellbook's not doing all that much,

**[18:02]** just kind of repeating that thing that happened when you awoke IHORT. That's just going to happen every

**[18:08]** doom phase, replacing any acolytes with broods if you have any in your pool. So if you have the full

**[18:16]** 6 broods in play and 6 acolytes in play, this is not doing anything for you, but I think that's fine

**[18:22]** because you're getting 6 additional Power during gather Power, so you're not even worried about it at that point.

**[18:30]** Which factions like this great old one? I think this one is just extremely good across the board.

**[18:36]** Nobody is going to turn their nose up at potentially 6 additional Power. If you've played on Yoggoth and

**[18:43]** you've done surgery, if you've played with high priests, I've played recently with the Dunwich

**[18:49]** Horror expansion. Just having more Cultists and extra Power passively generating for you every gather

**[18:57]** Power is one of the best things that you can be doing in my opinion. So I don't really think any

**[19:02]** faction dislikes this one for that reason. Maybe I give a slight nod to the defensive factions because

**[19:09]** they're going to have many more redundant Cultists protecting their Gates and some of them can even

**[19:14]** declare battle if they need to. I think this is just a generally useful great old one. If you buy this,

**[19:21]** you're probably going to get a lot of mileage out of it and if you're playing against IHORT, I would

**[19:26]** definitely recommend trying to kill this one because you are just not going to be able to compete with

**[19:32]** 6 additional Power against IHORT's controller every turn.

**[19:37]** And I think that's all I have to say about IHORT, the stuff of nightmares. Definitely read Before the

**[19:44]** Storm if you have a chance. It's not very long but it is very disturbing. A nice great old one for all the

**[19:51]** Alien franchise fans out there. Let's move on to our last unit.

**[19:58]** There's no description of the being. It was made out of some living iridescent metal as far as I can

**[20:04]** make out, but there are no actual pictures. Occasionally footnotes occur, but if there ever

**[20:10]** was a picture it must have been torn out. There are numerous references to the sentient spines and the

**[20:16]** writers go into great detail about this. It's to do with the initiation of a novice into the cult of

**[20:22]** Glacky and explains in its own superstitious way the legends of the witch's mark.

**[20:31]** And yes, our last unit from this expansion is the independent great old one, Glacky.

**[20:37]** Glacky. This one you can read about in the story The Inhabitant of the Lake. Sculpted by a Joe Brumby,

**[20:47]** who's done a lot of sculpts. Great job. This one looks very creepy. Very similar to how it's described

**[20:53]** in the story. I love it. Just kind of looking like a nasty slug with lots of spines. Those metallic

**[21:00]** spines that were mentioned. Got three stalks with eyes. Big mouth with teeth. I don't want to be

**[21:07]** anywhere near this thing. It looks very scary. To get Glacky, you're going to need a controlled Gate

**[21:15]** in an area with your great old one, and then you're going to pay four Power and place Glacky in the

**[21:20]** area containing the Gate. And Glacky has combat equal to the number of acolyte Cultists in your pool.

**[21:27]** So that's kind of interesting. The ability on Glacky is the Tomb Herd. In the gather Power phase,

**[21:35]** earn one Power per acolyte Cultist in your pool. Count these before any enemy sacrificing your

**[21:41]** captured Cultists gives them back to you. So right off the bat, pretty weird set of abilities. So the

**[21:50]** combat of this great old one gets higher the more acolytes are in your pool. Potentially

**[21:57]** a combat of six, though if that's the case, you're not controlling any Gates. So be careful about that.

**[22:03]** You do want to probably control at least two Gates, ideally maybe two or three. So I'd say on average,

**[22:10]** the combat for this is going to be fairly low, like maybe a three or two or four.

**[22:16]** Tomb Herd ability, pretty wild. So you're not really being penalized for having acolytes in your pool now.

**[22:23]** You're still earning Power for them. And I really like this. I've said in plenty of other episodes that

**[22:29]** the pool is actually a really great place for your acolytes because they're safe.

**[22:34]** Obviously you'd prefer them to be in play generating Power for you and ideally controlling Gates, but

**[22:40]** that's often not the case. You're typically on like two or three Gates if you're doing,

**[22:45]** you know, medium to good in the game. And this great old one lets you just kind of chill out and

**[22:51]** deploy your acolytes from your pool only when you need to, like maybe only when you're about to take

**[22:56]** control of another Gate. So I really like that. Keeping your acolytes safe is a very nice thing.

**[23:03]** The Spellbook requirement here, you are the first player to reach zero Power during the action phase.

**[23:09]** Windwalker taking hibernate does not fulfill this requirement. Spellbook requirement not at all hard

**[23:16]** to earn. You could intentionally spend a bunch of Power all at once in a big move if you needed to,

**[23:21]** worst case scenario, but I think this one's going to happen pretty naturally. You have a lot of control

**[23:27]** over when you can earn this one, which I like. And you will want to earn this because the Spellbook is

**[23:33]** green decay. During the gather Power phase, whenever a captured Cultist is sacrificed and

**[23:39]** returned, gain an Elder Sign instead of your normal reward of one Power.

**[23:46]** So this is extremely strong. If you manage to capture even one Cultist, I think it's pretty worth it.

**[23:52]** Like, say we spent two Power, like one to move and one to capture. Two Power for one Elder Sign is a

**[23:59]** great deal in my book. Anything on top of that is just actively insanely good. Everyone in the game is

**[24:07]** in big trouble if the Glackey player manages to just capture three Cultists. Like, that's at least three

**[24:13]** doom. Probably more closer to five or six doom. You do not want to be on the wrong side of this one.

**[24:20]** If you manage to capture a couple times with this, earning some Elder Signs, the game's probably just

**[24:25]** yours to lose. And hopefully you also stole a Gate or two along the way and have easily deployed the

**[24:31]** Cultists which may have been hanging out in your pool. Your doom tempo is just going to skyrocket and

**[24:36]** I think you're well on your way to winning the game with this if you manage to get the Spellbook and

**[24:41]** get a few captures off. What factions like this great old one? I would say the fighty factions that are more

**[24:49]** mobile for sure. You can roll up with your death ball. You might just be able to straight up capture

**[24:54]** multiple Cultists but battling people out of the way, giving Glackey kind of an entourage,

**[25:00]** getting into those areas with the Cultists and protecting it is going to be key in getting you

**[25:05]** those Elder Signs. And I think that's all that we have for the Ramsay Campbell Horrors expansion number one.

**[25:16]** I'll give you some of my closing thoughts here. Overall this just seems like a solid group of units,

**[25:24]** if a little complex with the insects of Shigai specifically. I don't think the insects are bad,

**[25:31]** to be clear. I actually think they're pretty good, or they would be. I've not played with them. Beware,

**[25:37]** I wouldn't throw these in a game with people who are very new. You might end up breaking some brains.

**[25:43]** You're probably going to get a lot of questions regardless of how experienced the players are, so just know that if you plan to use the insects going in.

**[25:53]** On the great old ones, Glackey and IHort, I really like both of these. They're pretty straightforward,

**[25:59]** and they're pretty Powerful, both of them. IHort in particular, I don't think is going to necessarily

**[26:06]** favor any one faction. So I feel pretty nice about including that one in a game. It's going to be

**[26:12]** sought after. It might be fought over. People might come to kill IHort just so they can get it for themselves.

**[26:18]** I think that's pretty nice. And yeah, obviously the stories behind all these great old ones are very

**[26:26]** strong. So great job, Ramsay Campbell, for writing about these, and great job, Sandy, others, for

**[26:33]** deciding to include these in Cthulhu Wars. I think these are all great additions to the game.

**[26:40]** I think that's another episode in the books. Hopefully you enjoyed. Hopefully I've inspired you

**[27:39]** There's a story among the country people, and it extends to them in the suburbs around Mercy Hill,

**[27:45]** which is nearest your place. Something lives in the lake and sends out nightmares to lure people to it.

**[27:51]** Even though the nightmares are terrifying, they're said to have a hypnotic effect. Since the place

**[27:56]** became untenanted, people, children particularly, in the Mercy Hill area have been dreaming, and one

**[28:03]** or two have been admitted to the Hill Hospital. No wonder they have nightmares around there. It used to

**[28:09]** be the site of the gallows, you know, and the hospital was a prison. Only some joker called it Mercy Hill,

**[28:16]** and the name stuck. They say the dreams are the work of what's in the lake. It's hungry and casting its

**[28:22]** net further out. Of course, it's all superstition. God knows what they think it is.
