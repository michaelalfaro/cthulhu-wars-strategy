## Transcript

**[00:00]** It was in the year of the red moon that a human being first dared to breathe defiance against Gitanathoa and its nameless menace.

**[00:08]** This bold heretic was Tiag, high priest of Shub-Nigaroth and guardian of the copper temple of the goat with a thousand young.

**[00:16]** Tiag had thought long on the Powers of various gods and had had strange dreams and revelations touching the life of this and earlier worlds.

**[00:24]** In the end, he felt sure that the gods friendly to man could be arrayed against the hostile gods and believed that Shub-Nigaroth, Nug, and Yeb, as well as Yig the serpent god, were ready to take sides with man against the tyranny and presumption of Gitanathoa.

**[00:54]** Hello, and welcome to Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:02]** My name's Graham. I'm your host.

**[01:04]** Hope you're doing well.

**[01:06]** It's kind of a cold, chilly morning where I am, but I've got my tea and I've got my recordings ready to roll.

**[01:12]** I'm hot off my black goat guide, and I'm putting out this episode at the same time.

**[01:17]** We're going to be talking about the High Priest expansion.

**[01:21]** I wanted to get this episode out sooner rather than later because I think this is one of the most commonly asked about expansions in places I've seen people ask around the internet.

**[01:32]** What are High Priest? Should I use High Priest? Do you recommend High Priest?

**[01:35]** Hopefully you can answer all those questions for yourself after hearing this guide.

**[01:40]** First, let's talk about High Priest. What are they exactly?

**[01:44]** They are recruited just like acolytes.

**[01:47]** They generate Power during the gather Power phase.

**[01:50]** They can create and control Gates just like an acolyte, and they can be captured just like an acolyte.

**[01:56]** Every faction has access to only a single High Priest.

**[02:00]** If you've ever played with the Chocho faction, they have High Priest. They have three of them.

**[02:06]** The High Priest expansion works exactly the same way that the Chocho High Priests do.

**[02:12]** High Priests benefit from all Spellbooks or abilities that reference Cultists, but not acolytes.

**[02:17]** A little bit of rules legalese here. Cultists are often called acolytes.

**[02:22]** If you've been playing without the High Priest expansion, this is a little bit like all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares kind of thing.

**[02:30]** I did a little bit of research before recording this episode on which books are specific to acolytes and which books can actually affect High Priests.

**[02:40]** Don't think this is an exhaustive list here, but books that affect only acolytes but not High Priests.

**[02:45]** That would be Zyngaya. Cannot Zyngaya a High Priest.

**[02:48]** Dreams. Can only Dreams acolytes, not High Priests.

**[02:51]** Psychosis can only place acolytes and not High Priests.

**[02:56]** Groth, on the other hand, I believe is one of the only abilities that doesn't care about whether or not it's an acolyte.

**[03:03]** It just hits all Cultists.

**[03:05]** Be careful if Black Goat wants to use Groth.

**[03:07]** Maybe consider sacrificing your High Priest.

**[03:11]** How do they work exactly?

**[03:13]** As I mentioned, they're ocCultists for all intents and purposes.

**[03:16]** The main difference is they recruit for 3 Power instead of just 1 Power.

**[03:21]** And all of the High Priests have an ability, Unspeakable Oath.

**[03:25]** At the end of any player's action, even if it's not your turn, you can sacrifice your High Priest and return it to your pool to add 2 to your Power.

**[03:33]** This can also be done during the Gather Power phase or the Doom phase.

**[03:37]** First, a note on the timing of the ability.

**[03:40]** It is actually kind of the same timing as Devolve, so very few abilities work exactly like this.

**[03:46]** So you can kind of do this in between actions to react to people.

**[03:51]** So there's like a lot of implications.

**[03:53]** The most significant thing is if you're at 0 Power, you can actually sacrifice your High Priest and get back into the game and have 2 Power to work with.

**[04:02]** This is like a huge deal for people coming after your Gates.

**[04:05]** If you have a High Priest, you can suddenly pop it and defend yourself.

**[04:08]** Or if somebody else doesn't have a High Priest, it's going to allow you to maybe walk over and steal somebody's Gate or walk onto an abandoned Gate.

**[04:16]** Things like that.

**[04:18]** So we've decided to play in our game with High Priests.

**[04:22]** How do they change the opening strategies for Cthulhu Wars?

**[04:26]** I'd say pretty significantly.

**[04:27]** So for Action Phase 1 through 3, I think the script is totally rewritten with these.

**[04:33]** Any faction that has an expensive Great Old One like Crawling Chaos or Great Cthulhu, I strongly recommend completely revising your Action Phase 1 opening in order to accommodate getting a High Priest.

**[04:46]** Because it makes Action Phase 2 way, way better for you.

**[04:49]** Let me give you an example.

**[04:50]** With Crawling Chaos, you can move 2 spaces, that's great.

**[04:56]** Crawling Chaos can build these remote area Gates.

**[04:59]** So you've got 8 Power to start the game.

**[05:01]** Move once, that's 7 Power.

**[05:03]** Build a Gate, that's 3 Power.

**[05:05]** You've got 4 Power left.

**[05:07]** You can summon a Night Gaunt at your newly constructed Gate, so you've got 3 Power left.

**[05:11]** And then you can recruit a High Priest at your starting Gate.

**[05:14]** So, in Gather Power, you'll have 11 Power compared to the typical 10, because you'll have your 2 controlled Gates and then 7 Acolytes instead of your typical 6.

**[05:25]** That means on Action Phase 2, you can awaken Crawling Chaos and still have enough Power left to use 1000 forms, or pop your High Priest and do a couple of other things.

**[05:35]** Maybe you go capture an Acolyte.

**[05:37]** Popping your High Priest to go from 11 to 13 Power before awakening Narlathotep is also going to earn you a Spellbook as Crawling Chaos.

**[05:47]** Similarly, with Great Cthulhu, I would highly recommend move, build a Gate, summon a Deep One, and then recruit a High Priest at your starting Gate.

**[05:56]** In Action Phase 2, you'll have enough to awaken Great Cthulhu, probably took some merge.

**[06:01]** You may be able to submerge, reemerge, and get one of your fight Spellbooks in Action Phase 2.

**[06:08]** Pretty big deal.

**[06:09]** If you're somehow able to get that mythical 3 devours or kills in 1 battle and 2 Spellbooks, that's amazing.

**[06:15]** In Action Phase 3, the only thing you need to do left for your Spellbook requirements is build that Ocean Gate, and then you're all set to roll.

**[06:24]** I could go on.

**[06:25]** Suffice it to say that the opening strategies are changed pretty significantly with High Priest.

**[06:30]** Let's talk about good times for recruiting a High Priest.

**[06:35]** I would say it's a great time to recruit a High Priest anytime you had a good turn on the previous Action Phase and you have the most Power, or one of the highest Powers.

**[06:44]** I love recruiting them as one of my first actions.

**[06:48]** Another time would be when you don't have a lot of Power and you want to be sure you can maintain control of the 2-3 Gates that you might have.

**[06:55]** Recruit a High Priest.

**[06:56]** Even if you have one or no Power after recruiting, remember you can pop your High Priest and hop back in the game.

**[07:02]** Even if someone comes after your Gates, you'll have the ability to react and defend yourself.

**[07:08]** Another great time to think about High Priest is whenever you need a spare Cultist to control a Gate for you.

**[07:15]** Remember, they're Cultists, so they follow the same rules as recruiting.

**[07:18]** As long as you have a unit in the area, you can recruit a High Priest.

**[07:22]** They act as your 7th Acolyte, so if you ever find yourself in the position to take a Gate but your normal Acolytes are not nearby, you can recruit a High Priest.

**[07:32]** It's going to sit on the Gate and control it just as well as any of your Acolytes.

**[07:36]** Let's talk about a little bit of tips and tricks.

**[07:40]** I think I already mentioned just the overall potential of Gates that you can control is increased by 1 with your High Priest.

**[07:47]** You could have potentially 7 Gates.

**[07:49]** That is a huge deal.

**[07:51]** If you ever find yourself in that position, that is basically a million doom.

**[07:54]** If you're able to control 7 Gates, the game's probably over.

**[07:57]** It's like 14 Doom Swing on the Doom Phase, plus any Elder Signs you might get from Ritualing.

**[08:04]** Just because you've recruited your High Priest already, that doesn't mean that it's stuck where it is.

**[08:09]** You can always pop your High Priest for 2 Power, and then quote-unquote teleport your High Priest anywhere you need to recruit.

**[08:17]** We're going after some Gate that's not near any of our stuff.

**[08:21]** We've got our High Priest safely with our other Acolytes and Defended Gates.

**[08:25]** If we do get close and have this abandoned Gate, or a Gate that we've just conquered,

**[08:29]** pop your High Priest for 2 Power, and then recruit it into your newly found Gate area.

**[08:35]** That's going to be a really easy way to not need to spend Power on moving,

**[08:38]** and already get a unit there to control that Gate.

**[08:42]** The last trick with High Priest I want to talk about, which I don't see very often,

**[08:46]** but it is an option, is the dreaded High Priest stall.

**[08:50]** You can't see, but I just made the sign of the cross there.

**[08:53]** If you recruit your High Priest for 3 Power, next action, you can pop your High Priest for 2 Power,

**[09:00]** and then just recruit it again for 3 Power.

**[09:03]** So effectively, we're spending 3 Power, gaining 2 Power back.

**[09:07]** We have a repeatable access to a 1 cost action.

**[09:11]** Kind of debatable how useful it is, but if you don't have anything to do with your Power,

**[09:15]** and you do want to maintain a presence in the game as an active player,

**[09:19]** you can feel free to just sacrifice your High Priest over and over again and repeatedly recruit.

**[09:24]** Staying in the game in case somebody comes after you.

**[09:28]** The last section for this High Priest overview,

**[09:31]** should your group use High Priest?

**[09:33]** That's a question I see posed very often.

**[09:36]** I can say for myself, from personal experience, I was definitely a hater.

**[09:40]** When I first knew about them and first started to use them,

**[09:42]** I kind of got the impression...

**[09:44]** Sorry, I'm a recovering Magic the Gathering player,

**[09:47]** so I'm going to keep using these Magic analogies.

**[09:50]** I got the impression, the initial impression,

**[09:52]** that High Priest would feel like everyone was playing blue,

**[09:54]** and that everyone has a way to react at instant speed,

**[09:58]** and that it would kind of be a staring contest at the end of every action phase

**[10:02]** for who's going to pop their High Priest first.

**[10:05]** That can still happen from time to time,

**[10:07]** but it doesn't happen as often as you would think.

**[10:09]** Typically, not every player will have one,

**[10:13]** but it is exciting when everybody does have one.

**[10:16]** I would follow the typical turn rotation at the end of the action phase

**[10:20]** when everybody's out of Power.

**[10:21]** Just ask everybody,

**[10:23]** Hey, do you want to pop a High Priest?

**[10:25]** Going once, going twice like an auction.

**[10:27]** If nobody says yes, okay, great.

**[10:29]** We're moving on to gather Power.

**[10:31]** I would recommend this if your group is getting more experience with Cthulhu Wars,

**[10:35]** and if ever you think Vanilla Earth is starting to feel stale with no add-ons,

**[10:40]** I don't know how that ever happens.

**[10:42]** I've played hundreds of games on Earth.

**[10:44]** It's still fun, still the most balanced map.

**[10:47]** But yeah, High Priest can be a little bit spiced to add.

**[10:50]** Notably, they weaken a little bit factions like Chocho and Sleeper,

**[10:54]** and that's because Chocho is no longer the only faction with access to High Priest,

**[10:59]** so it takes away a little bit of the uniqueness that Chocho brings to the table.

**[11:03]** And it weakens Sleeper because the typical play with Lethargy,

**[11:07]** Sleeper's unique ability is to wait until you can do nothing as an action

**[11:11]** if you don't know what Lethargy is.

**[11:13]** You can kind of just sit around until everyone's out of Power.

**[11:17]** That's no longer as effective if everybody has a High Priest

**[11:19]** because if Sleeper marches into your area,

**[11:21]** you can now pop High Priest and react and move your great old one in,

**[11:26]** and that's Power that they may be wasted on moving.

**[11:30]** Maybe this is a con of using the High Priest.

**[11:32]** I do think they add slightly additional time onto the game.

**[11:36]** In the spots where the end of action phase, everyone's thinking about,

**[11:39]** oh, am I going to pop?

**[11:40]** You might find people sitting, thinking for a minute about,

**[11:43]** do I want to pop? Do I not want to pop?

**[11:45]** That's okay, just know that going in.

**[11:47]** One other con I would think of the High Priest,

**[11:49]** which I think can be fixed with a simple house rule,

**[11:52]** is regarding Crawling Chaos.

**[11:53]** I recommend playing with the rule that Crawling Chaos cannot use their High Priest

**[11:58]** to return from zero Power and then use Thousand Forms.

**[12:03]** That's just like pretty warping to the game.

**[12:05]** Not really in the spirit of Thousand Forms, I guess you could say.

**[12:08]** Of course, you run into situations where nobody has any Power,

**[12:11]** and Crawling Chaos is going to use the Thousand Forms and gain the Power regardless,

**[12:15]** but it feels a little bit warping when there's High Priest in the game.

**[12:18]** If Crawling Chaos can jump in with two Power,

**[12:20]** nobody has any High Priest, they use Thousand Forms,

**[12:23]** there's no way anybody can pay for it, and they roll like a five.

**[12:26]** That's pretty gross.

**[12:27]** That's like seven Power that nobody can stop Crawling Chaos from working with,

**[12:31]** so recommend not playing with that.

**[12:34]** Closing thoughts on High Priest.

**[12:36]** Overall, I do really like this expansion for Cthulhu Wars.

**[12:41]** Cthulhu Wars is a very delicious cake,

**[12:44]** and a lot of these expansions like High Priest or alternate maps or neutral units

**[12:49]** are delicious layers of sponge that you can add to your cake.

**[12:53]** Sorry, I watch a lot of Great British Baking Show.

**[12:57]** High Priest, I'd say, is like a really thin layer that you can add to your cake of Cthulhu Wars,

**[13:02]** but it's a very tasty layer.

**[13:04]** There's not a lot of mental overhead to add the High Priest.

**[13:08]** If everyone's seen Cho Cho, they already know how High Priest work,

**[13:11]** and I think they do a lot to make the game, in a lot of ways, more interesting,

**[13:16]** and the only real drawback is the slight, slight addition of more time onto your game.

**[13:21]** I don't think that just because you've put High Priest in your game,

**[13:25]** that that makes it so that your group can only play one game,

**[13:28]** where previously they could play two games on Earth.

**[13:31]** The time they add to the game is minimal,

**[13:33]** and they bring a lot to the table in terms of twisting and changing strategies

**[13:37]** and adding a lot more interesting decisions to the game.

**[13:40]** I think overall they're a great choice.

**[13:42]** Maybe you don't need them in every game,

**[13:44]** but I think they're a fine addition to most games.

**[13:47]** They've got my seal of approval.

**[13:49]** Hopefully you enjoyed this guide,

**[13:51]** and you can include High Priest in your next game,

**[13:54]** and everybody will enjoy them.

**[13:57]** That being said, that's another episode of Opening the Way in the Books.
