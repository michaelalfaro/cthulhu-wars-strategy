## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:23]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[00:26]** I hope you're doing well wherever you are, and that you're having a good week.

**[00:32]** I'm recording this on Friday morning, so looking forward to the weekend.

**[00:37]** I don't usually comment on the ongoing Cthulhu Wars fulfillment, but it sounds like that's getting to a pretty good place,

**[00:45]** and things are finally moving in the United States, so hopefully everybody is going to get their stuff soon, finally, after several years.

**[00:53]** In another bit of news, tickets for PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia went on sale yesterday at time of recording this.

**[01:02]** It's December 1st through the 3rd in the Philadelphia Convention Center.

**[01:07]** I will be there. I am absolutely planning on playing some Cthulhu Wars while I'm there.

**[01:11]** If anyone also finds themselves at PAX that weekend, definitely reach out to me on Discord.

**[01:18]** I would love to meet up with you and play Cthulhu Wars with you, or any of the other games I'm into.

**[01:25]** Arkham Horror the Card Game, or Root, or some Commander, Magic the Gathering.

**[01:31]** It's been a lot of fun. I went, I think, every year that PAX has been around,

**[01:35]** and obviously I didn't go during the pandemic, so it's been a couple of years.

**[01:40]** I'm really looking forward to going back.

**[01:44]** On to today's episode, what are we talking about?

**[01:47]** We are doing another map episode, this time on the library at Celiano.

**[01:54]** Celiano? Not sure how you pronounce this.

**[01:56]** I have not read the source material on this one, though I believe it is from the story The Trail of Cthulhu,

**[02:04]** or The House on Kerwin Street by August Durlith.

**[02:09]** The library is basically just a big repository of information about the Great Old Ones.

**[02:15]** Great Old Ones go there to learn things, I guess, and it's somewhere out in the cosmos.

**[02:20]** I'll just quickly do an overview of the map and kind of my opening thoughts.

**[02:28]** This map is very, very chaotic, so if you're looking to have a lot of shenanigans happen during a game,

**[02:37]** this might be the map for you.

**[02:39]** But if you're looking for more stability, less swinginess, I would not want to play on this map.

**[02:45]** If you want the crazy, Powerful mechanics, you'll probably be into this.

**[02:52]** My playgroup in real life really, really likes this map.

**[02:55]** It's been requested, I think, the last three or four times that we've gotten together,

**[02:59]** which surprised me, but it is enjoyable to play on.

**[03:02]** I, myself, like some chaos.

**[03:04]** I was a fan of the Dreamlands map.

**[03:06]** I think this map is kind of like one step above complexity compared to the Dreamlands.

**[03:11]** It also shares a few similarities to Dreamlands in terms of the layout, so I will get into that right now.

**[03:20]** This is another map that does not wrap around like Earth.

**[03:25]** Instead, it has an upper-lower level like in the Dreamlands.

**[03:29]** Analogous to the tunnels on the Dreamlands,

**[03:33]** the library has lettered staircases, which work exactly the same way.

**[03:38]** So staircase A on the top floor is adjacent to staircase A on the ground floor.

**[03:47]** And you can freely pain yourself up and down the stairs if you need to after battle.

**[03:54]** This map has even more connectivity and complexity in terms of adjacency than the Dreamlands, though.

**[04:02]** It also has these areas called archways.

**[04:05]** All areas with archways are adjacent to each other in terms of movement.

**[04:11]** But you cannot pain yourself through an archway the way you can with the staircases.

**[04:17]** There's all kinds of opportunities for intelligent, creative movement decisions because of these archways.

**[04:25]** You're never really that far away from anybody on the library,

**[04:28]** and that's something that you always have to remember.

**[04:30]** Because of those archways, nobody's really going to be remote and unable to be messed with by the other players.

**[04:38]** Getting into the mechanics of the library,

**[04:44]** there is a new resource called silence tokens,

**[04:47]** which players can spend in order to call upon the custodian or the librarian,

**[04:53]** more on them later,

**[04:55]** or to reuse some of their tomes,

**[04:59]** which we will also talk about.

**[05:01]** These replenish during the doom phase,

**[05:04]** and they're a nice zero-cost action to use.

**[05:09]** There are four Powerful tomes that players can obtain

**[05:12]** by controlling Gates in certain areas on the second floor.

**[05:17]** These are really going to shape the game as you play

**[05:20]** because they are so Powerful and warping.

**[05:22]** Lastly, there is the custodian,

**[05:27]** who can send naughty players to the oubliette,

**[05:30]** which is an ocean area on the ground floor.

**[05:33]** And there's also a librarian,

**[05:35]** who can punish players who have overdue tomes.

**[05:38]** We'll explain what that means here in a bit.

**[05:43]** The first thing to break down would be the silence tokens.

**[05:47]** Everybody's going to start with a silence token,

**[05:49]** and on your turn, as an action,

**[05:52]** you may spend zero Power,

**[05:54]** discard your silence token,

**[05:55]** and do one of the following.

**[05:58]** You can activate the custodian,

**[06:00]** or you can activate the librarian

**[06:02]** if an enemy player has an overdue library tome.

**[06:05]** You might also be using these silence tokens

**[06:08]** to reuse one of your tomes,

**[06:09]** which we will get into.

**[06:12]** Not too much to say on silence tokens.

**[06:15]** Just calling out that they're a renewable resource,

**[06:18]** you will get them again during the doom phase,

**[06:20]** so you really should be using this every action phase,

**[06:24]** even if it's not a very impressive thing to do.

**[06:27]** It's a zero cost action,

**[06:29]** it's like walking in place for one turn,

**[06:30]** so it can be easy to forget about these,

**[06:33]** but you're really kind of like missing out

**[06:35]** on an opportunity by not spending one.

**[06:39]** Though most of the time,

**[06:40]** you're going to have a reason to use this,

**[06:41]** because there's so much crazy stuff happening on this map.

**[06:44]** I'll try to break down the next section of rules

**[06:49]** in a way that makes sense.

**[06:50]** So firstly, a little bit of rules

**[06:52]** on the library tomes themselves.

**[06:56]** The library tomes act as additional available Spellbooks,

**[06:59]** however, they're not placed on your faction card.

**[07:02]** They also don't count toward having six Spellbooks

**[07:04]** for the purposes of unlimited battle

**[07:06]** and winning the game.

**[07:09]** This part's important.

**[07:10]** When you control a Gate in an area with a tome,

**[07:14]** take that library's tome if it's still on the map

**[07:16]** and place it by your faction card.

**[07:18]** You may now use its ability

**[07:19]** as though it were a standard Spellbook.

**[07:22]** We'll break down the tomes in just a second,

**[07:25]** but trust me, you want these.

**[07:27]** They're extremely strong, you'll see.

**[07:29]** Also know, on the other hand,

**[07:31]** as soon as you take a tome,

**[07:32]** you will be a target immediately.

**[07:34]** We know there are four tomes

**[07:37]** and there are four areas

**[07:39]** where you can take tomes

**[07:41]** if you control a Gate in the area.

**[07:44]** You'll see this on the map.

**[07:46]** There's a big square

**[07:47]** where you can fit the library tome

**[07:48]** and there should be plenty of space also for a Gate.

**[07:52]** There will be Gates appearing in these tome areas

**[07:56]** and that will make the tomes up for grabs

**[07:58]** during the first doom phase.

**[08:00]** At the start of the first doom phase,

**[08:02]** place a Gate in each of the four areas

**[08:04]** where the library tomes were placed during setup,

**[08:07]** unless a Gate's already present.

**[08:09]** The Gate creation happens only once

**[08:10]** in the first doom phase.

**[08:12]** If one or more of these areas

**[08:13]** is missing its Gate later,

**[08:15]** nothing happens.

**[08:17]** It can be tempting on the library

**[08:18]** to move an acolyte into a tome area

**[08:21]** and wait patiently for the first doom phase

**[08:24]** and then you're kind of like

**[08:25]** getting control of a tome right away.

**[08:29]** But it can be equally as tempting

**[08:31]** to just build a Gate there

**[08:32]** before the first doom phase if possible

**[08:34]** or move a Gate there

**[08:35]** because the tomes really are that strong.

**[08:40]** Last point on the spontaneous Gate creation

**[08:43]** in these tome areas,

**[08:44]** I would say your configuration of the map

**[08:47]** with the three and five player sides here,

**[08:49]** it makes a huge difference.

**[08:51]** The three player side,

**[08:54]** some of the tome areas are adjacent

**[08:56]** to black goat, yellow sign,

**[08:58]** and Windwalker star areas,

**[09:00]** so they're extremely dangerous

**[09:02]** from the beginning of the game.

**[09:04]** Even just moving and building a Gate

**[09:05]** from any of these factions

**[09:06]** is going to be a huge deal

**[09:09]** because tomes are going to be got right away

**[09:11]** before the first doom phase.

**[09:13]** I would suggest the more balanced thing to do

**[09:16]** is play with the five player side

**[09:18]** of the upper level that has the tome areas.

**[09:21]** It's still adjacent to some faction start areas,

**[09:23]** notably black goat, my love,

**[09:25]** but there's more areas up there obviously,

**[09:28]** so it makes it a little bit more difficult

**[09:29]** to get to the tome areas.

**[09:33]** And all the Opener of the Way players

**[09:35]** listening to this episode so far

**[09:38]** are salivating.

**[09:39]** Now they're hearing a plus four Gates

**[09:41]** on the doom phase,

**[09:42]** and they're very stoked on that

**[09:43]** for their eight and 12 Gate Spellbook.

**[09:45]** For sure, this is really good,

**[09:47]** but you know, remember it only happens

**[09:49]** once the entire game,

**[09:50]** so if you start beyond one-ing,

**[09:52]** you're not going to have more Gates

**[09:53]** appear there later

**[09:54]** because it only happens once.

**[09:57]** Let's talk about overdue library tomes.

**[10:00]** Not sure where editing Graham's

**[10:02]** going to put this one.

**[10:03]** If you lose control of a Gate

**[10:04]** in a library tome area,

**[10:06]** then that area's library tome

**[10:08]** is now overdue.

**[10:09]** This does not affect

**[10:10]** your use of the tome.

**[10:11]** It remains next to your faction card,

**[10:13]** and you can still keep it

**[10:14]** and use its effects.

**[10:16]** However, once you have

**[10:17]** an overdue library tome,

**[10:18]** you are now vulnerable

**[10:19]** to the librarian's agony,

**[10:22]** which we'll talk a little bit more

**[10:23]** about later.

**[10:25]** Basically, the agony is going to give people

**[10:27]** a couple of unpleasant options

**[10:28]** in order to try to pay

**[10:31]** for having an overdue tome.

**[10:33]** So if you're playing on the library,

**[10:35]** you have an overdue tome,

**[10:36]** I would just lean into it,

**[10:38]** keep using it while you can,

**[10:39]** people are probably coming for you.

**[10:42]** Multiple players calling the librarian

**[10:43]** on you is not going to go well,

**[10:45]** so yeah, use your tome while you can.

**[10:48]** If you're a player without an overdue tome,

**[10:50]** great, you've got nothing to worry about

**[10:52]** from the librarian.

**[10:54]** Let's get into the tomes themselves.

**[10:56]** What do they do?

**[10:57]** First one I'll say is a bit hard to pronounce.

**[11:00]** It's Ear in the N'gir,

**[11:03]** which I'm going to call YNN from here on out

**[11:06]** because it's a lot easier to say.

**[11:07]** I had no idea what this name was from,

**[11:11]** but I asked around,

**[11:12]** so thank you for cartridge on Discord

**[11:15]** for letting me know.

**[11:17]** This is from Alan Moore's

**[11:19]** The Courtyard comic,

**[11:21]** and it is Aklo,

**[11:23]** which is like a mythos language,

**[11:25]** and it's talking about the concept of

**[11:27]** nested time,

**[11:29]** like the past is happening right now.

**[11:31]** Kind of cool.

**[11:31]** What does this tome do?

**[11:35]** It's a one-cost action.

**[11:36]** If any enemy faction has more doom than you,

**[11:39]** choose one.

**[11:40]** Either place one monster at your controlled Gate

**[11:42]** for no additional cost,

**[11:44]** or gain two Power.

**[11:46]** Flip this card face down.

**[11:47]** You may flip it face up again

**[11:49]** and reuse it by releasing a captured Cultist

**[11:51]** back to its owner's pool,

**[11:53]** discarding an Elder Sign,

**[11:54]** or discarding a silence token.

**[11:56]** It also flips up in the next doom phase.

**[11:59]** So this is not the most overtly Powerful tome,

**[12:05]** but make no mistake,

**[12:06]** it's very strong,

**[12:07]** and because it's really flexible,

**[12:10]** it can be good with either option.

**[12:13]** Some factions are really going to like

**[12:14]** the ability to summon

**[12:15]** an expensive monster for free,

**[12:17]** so some would be like

**[12:19]** Opener, Sleeper,

**[12:21]** Windwalker with the Nafkes.

**[12:23]** They're going to love that option.

**[12:25]** Worst case scenario,

**[12:26]** if you have nothing to do,

**[12:27]** you can activate this tome

**[12:28]** to stall,

**[12:29]** and you'll have a net gain of one Power

**[12:31]** because it costs one Power to activate.

**[12:35]** You can always spend your silence token

**[12:37]** if you've got nothing else to do with it,

**[12:39]** so you'll be flipping the tome face up again,

**[12:41]** and you'll be able to flip it again,

**[12:43]** hopefully for more Power.

**[12:44]** Paying one of these costs

**[12:45]** to flip a tome face up,

**[12:47]** that's releasing a captured Cultist

**[12:49]** back to its owner's pool,

**[12:51]** discarding an Elder Sign,

**[12:52]** or discarding a silence token,

**[12:54]** is not an action.

**[12:55]** You can do it at any time,

**[12:56]** so there is no restriction on this.

**[12:58]** It's not the same as taking an action,

**[13:01]** it's not even the same as devolve,

**[13:03]** which you need to do in between actions.

**[13:05]** You can do this whenever you want,

**[13:06]** for what it's worth.

**[13:07]** You also have another really nice way to stall

**[13:11]** if you happen to stumble on a Gate

**[13:13]** that has several Cultists

**[13:15]** while their controller's out of Power.

**[13:17]** You could be capturing a Cultist,

**[13:20]** returning it to its owner's pool,

**[13:22]** flipping this book face up again,

**[13:25]** activating it to gain Power,

**[13:27]** rinse and repeat.

**[13:28]** You won't be netting any Power

**[13:30]** because you'll be spending it to capture

**[13:32]** and then to activate the book,

**[13:33]** but you will be able to stall

**[13:35]** pretty effectively using this.

**[13:38]** Notably, you'll be giving up

**[13:40]** on that extra Power you get

**[13:42]** from releasing captured Cultists

**[13:43]** during gather Power phase,

**[13:45]** but I leave that up to you,

**[13:46]** your discretion.

**[13:47]** Maybe you can get more Gates out of this.

**[13:49]** We'll see.

**[13:51]** Last thing would be,

**[13:53]** you can only activate this

**[13:54]** if a faction has more doom than you,

**[13:56]** so be careful.

**[13:57]** If you're going to be in the lead,

**[13:59]** this tome is going to be completely useless.

**[14:01]** Let's move on to the next tome,

**[14:06]** that is the Larvae of the Outer Gods.

**[14:10]** It's a one cost action.

**[14:12]** Gain one Elder Sign.

**[14:14]** If any active faction has more Power than you,

**[14:17]** flip this card face down.

**[14:19]** You may flip it face up again

**[14:21]** and reuse it by releasing a captured Cultist

**[14:23]** back to its owner's pool,

**[14:25]** discarding an Elder Sign,

**[14:26]** or discarding a Silence token.

**[14:28]** It also flips up in the next doom phase.

**[14:30]** I don't have a lot to say about this one,

**[14:35]** because it's pretty obvious.

**[14:36]** This is very, very good.

**[14:38]** Getting one free Elder Sign at minimum

**[14:40]** every turn is extremely strong.

**[14:43]** I would say this is the most Powerful of the tomes,

**[14:47]** and it's not particularly close.

**[14:49]** The restriction of somebody having more Power than you

**[14:53]** is so easy to play around,

**[14:54]** it might as well not even be there.

**[14:56]** Note that when you reuse this tome,

**[15:00]** you can discard an Elder Sign.

**[15:01]** So if you draw one from activating it earlier,

**[15:05]** and you just have an embarrassment of riches,

**[15:06]** you can always just discard that one

**[15:08]** and pay for it flipping back up.

**[15:11]** You will be the villain if you take this book,

**[15:14]** and you will be the target of the entire table.

**[15:16]** So if you're into that,

**[15:18]** just accept it,

**[15:19]** just lean into it,

**[15:20]** and take it.

**[15:21]** Turtle up.

**[15:23]** Just play the role.

**[15:24]** Do not try to play the victim

**[15:25]** when you take this book,

**[15:26]** because nobody's buying it.

**[15:28]** It's the best tome in the entire map,

**[15:31]** and you will be the target for the entire game

**[15:34]** until this stops being under your control.

**[15:36]** Just know that going in.

**[15:37]** Let's move on to another tome.

**[15:41]** We have the Barrier of Noctith.

**[15:44]** It's an ongoing ability.

**[15:45]** No other player may declare battle against you

**[15:47]** unless they release a captured Cultist

**[15:49]** back to its owner's pool.

**[15:51]** Discard an Elder Sign,

**[15:52]** or discard a Silence token.

**[15:55]** Put the shields up with this tome.

**[15:58]** This one is also really awesome.

**[16:00]** I think this one's probably the second best tome.

**[16:03]** It's the only one that has a templating like this.

**[16:06]** All the other tomes involve flipping themselves.

**[16:10]** If you're already a defensive faction,

**[16:14]** it's going to be a real pain for anybody

**[16:15]** to battle you effectively with this.

**[16:19]** People are going to need to pay

**[16:20]** in order to really hurt you,

**[16:22]** and that's where this book becomes really strong.

**[16:24]** The Silence token is probably the easiest way to pay,

**[16:28]** but you're giving up on a lot of different options

**[16:30]** by spending it to pay to get through the barrier.

**[16:32]** Past that, the other two options are pretty undesirable.

**[16:39]** You're probably not going to have

**[16:40]** a bunch of captured Cultists laying around

**[16:42]** in your pool in order to battle.

**[16:45]** Maybe one, maybe two.

**[16:47]** And giving up an Elder Sign

**[16:48]** just to be able to declare a battle against somebody,

**[16:50]** that feels awful.

**[16:53]** So the person who has the barrier,

**[16:55]** you don't really need to think about it too much.

**[16:56]** It's just a great shield for you.

**[16:58]** Players that don't have the barrier,

**[17:01]** maybe cooperate to strike at a strategic moment,

**[17:04]** while it's cheap to put the shields down, so to speak.

**[17:07]** Last tome, we have Guardian Under the Lake.

**[17:13]** It's a one-cost action.

**[17:15]** Choose an archway area and a faction there.

**[17:18]** Move all units of that faction in that area

**[17:20]** to any other archway area.

**[17:23]** Flip this card face down.

**[17:25]** You may flip it face up again and reuse it

**[17:27]** by releasing a captured Cultist back to its owner's pool,

**[17:30]** discarding an Elder Sign,

**[17:31]** or discarding a Silence token.

**[17:33]** It also flips up in the next Doom phase.

**[17:36]** On the surface, this might seem like the least Powerful book.

**[17:40]** Maybe it is, but all of these books are strong,

**[17:44]** and this one has so many possibilities and flexibility,

**[17:47]** so it is like deceptively Powerful.

**[17:51]** It's very disruptive.

**[17:53]** You can use this on yourself to invade an area,

**[17:55]** or you can totally transplant a defensive opponent

**[17:59]** way out of position.

**[18:00]** But just be careful, again,

**[18:03]** about those archway areas being adjacent to everything,

**[18:06]** including some of your stuff that you might have elsewhere.

**[18:11]** Notably, you can target somebody

**[18:13]** who's in one of those tome areas with this book

**[18:16]** and completely make them leave,

**[18:17]** and that's going to make their tome overdue right away.

**[18:21]** That makes this book great to use politically.

**[18:24]** You can be the hero

**[18:25]** and, you know, take that person

**[18:28]** who's got the larvae of the Outer Gods

**[18:31]** or the barrier,

**[18:32]** put them way out of position.

**[18:34]** Or you can use this one

**[18:35]** maybe just to pit people against each other.

**[18:37]** Maybe you take one person,

**[18:39]** they're totally turtled up in an area,

**[18:40]** and you just put them right in the same area

**[18:43]** as a big old Cthulhu death ball,

**[18:45]** and what do you think is going to happen

**[18:47]** if you do that?

**[18:47]** They're going to fight.

**[18:48]** Not too much else to say about the tomes.

**[18:53]** They're wow Powerful,

**[18:56]** and they're going to be really warping the game

**[18:58]** as soon as people start taking them and using them.

**[19:01]** You're going to notice right away

**[19:02]** that's going to become the most important thing to do

**[19:05]** is either optimize using your tome

**[19:07]** or take tomes away from people

**[19:09]** who are starting to pull ahead

**[19:11]** and really take over the game.

**[19:13]** Let's talk about the few denizens of the library,

**[19:18]** starting with the custodian.

**[19:20]** It looks like a, I don't know,

**[19:22]** like a nasty horseshoe crab lobster kind of vibe here.

**[19:27]** Looks a lot like Ran Tagoth from Windwalker.

**[19:29]** I feel like they're cousins,

**[19:31]** or they would like hang out with each other

**[19:33]** and eat whatever these giant elder god crabs would eat.

**[19:38]** You can spend a silence token

**[19:39]** to activate the custodian on somebody.

**[19:41]** You may place it or move it into any area

**[19:45]** or keep it in the same area,

**[19:47]** and then you roll the agony die,

**[19:49]** which is a six-sided die,

**[19:51]** and it has a result from one to three,

**[19:55]** and that is twice over,

**[19:57]** so a 33% chance to roll each one.

**[20:00]** If the custodian stays in the same area without moving,

**[20:04]** you add plus one to the agony die's final total.

**[20:07]** A number of units in the custodian's area

**[20:10]** equal to the result on the agony die

**[20:12]** must be moved to the oubliet area.

**[20:15]** If more than one faction is present,

**[20:17]** the activating player gets to choose

**[20:19]** how many units must go from each faction,

**[20:21]** up to the total on the agony die,

**[20:23]** but the affected player gets to choose

**[20:25]** which units are moved.

**[20:27]** The player who activated the custodian

**[20:29]** can choose their own units to be affected as well.

**[20:32]** If there are fewer units in the area

**[20:34]** than the result on the agony die roll,

**[20:36]** move all units present to the oubliet.

**[20:39]** No player may take control of an abandoned Gate

**[20:43]** in an area inhabited by the custodian.

**[20:45]** If the custodian is sent to an area

**[20:47]** with a controlled Gate,

**[20:49]** that Gate may remain controlled for the time being.

**[20:52]** If you create a Gate in an area with the custodian,

**[20:55]** it must remain abandoned until the custodian leaves.

**[21:00]** Additionally, players may not battle the custodian.

**[21:02]** It is immune to all Spellbooks, abilities, and other effects.

**[21:06]** The only interaction it has with a faction

**[21:08]** is when a player activates it with a silence token.

**[21:11]** It has no unit type.

**[21:12]** Let's break this down a little bit.

**[21:17]** This one is pretty cool.

**[21:19]** Go directly to jail.

**[21:21]** Don't collect $200.

**[21:23]** If you really need to get someone out of an area,

**[21:26]** particularly those tome areas,

**[21:28]** this is kind of how you do it.

**[21:30]** The best you can do is rolling a 3 on the agony die.

**[21:35]** So if you use this in like a big ball of units,

**[21:38]** it's not going to go well.

**[21:39]** I would be talking to the other players

**[21:41]** about cooperating and spending your silence tokens consecutively

**[21:46]** to activate the custodian on a particular person or persons.

**[21:50]** That's because if you activate it

**[21:52]** when it's already in the same area,

**[21:54]** you'll get plus 1 to that agony die.

**[21:57]** So if you really need to get someone away,

**[21:58]** talk to somebody else,

**[21:59]** and maybe you can cooperate and make it happen.

**[22:02]** Some factions can take advantage of the custodian.

**[22:06]** You can move yourself by targeting yourself with it if you want.

**[22:10]** About the Oubliette, it is a sea area,

**[22:13]** so that's good for Great Cthulhu.

**[22:15]** It also happens to be one of Windwalker's starting areas,

**[22:18]** so that's also important to keep in mind if they're in the game.

**[22:21]** It's either where they started,

**[22:22]** or it's the opposite pole where they want to travel to anyways.

**[22:26]** If you've got nothing better to do with your silence token,

**[22:30]** great thing to do is just pick a Gate

**[22:32]** with an acolyte and a monster on it.

**[22:34]** Exactly.

**[22:35]** You know, maybe 1 or 2 units.

**[22:37]** Call the custodian on there.

**[22:38]** You might get some abandoned Gate Power out of it

**[22:41]** in Gather Power.

**[22:43]** Lastly, that bit on the abandoned Gates.

**[22:49]** Once you empty out somebody from one of those tome areas

**[22:53]** and the custodian's hanging out at the empty Gate,

**[22:56]** it's actually going to guard that Gate from other people

**[22:59]** claiming it and claiming the tome

**[23:01]** until somebody calls the custodian somewhere else.

**[23:03]** So that's something to keep in mind too.

**[23:05]** It will kind of like lock down an area

**[23:07]** once the Gate becomes abandoned.

**[23:11]** And of course, I don't know why you would do this,

**[23:13]** but don't build a Gate next to the custodian either

**[23:15]** when you're in the area

**[23:16]** because you won't be able to control it right away.

**[23:23]** Let's move on to the librarian.

**[23:26]** This one's very cool looking.

**[23:28]** It kind of looks like...

**[23:30]** I don't know what it really looks like.

**[23:33]** It looks like an alien tripod,

**[23:36]** almost tree-looking thing.

**[23:38]** It's got a couple of eyes, three legs.

**[23:41]** It's surrounded by books.

**[23:42]** It's been hitting the books.

**[23:43]** Definitely has read everything in the library,

**[23:46]** what with being the librarian and all.

**[23:49]** The rules for the librarian can only be activated

**[23:52]** if at least one enemy faction has an overdue library tome.

**[23:56]** It's activated when a player spends a silence token

**[23:58]** and places the librarian into any area

**[24:01]** containing at least one unit from an enemy faction

**[24:04]** with an overdue library tome.

**[24:06]** The activating player then rolls the agony die,

**[24:09]** as with the custodian.

**[24:11]** Same with the custodian.

**[24:12]** If the library stays in the same area without moving,

**[24:15]** you add plus one to the agony die's final total.

**[24:18]** If there's more than one enemy faction in the area with an overdue tome,

**[24:24]** the activating player divides up the agony die's total

**[24:26]** between them as they please.

**[24:29]** Each victim must satisfy all the agony assigned to them

**[24:33]** by choosing from the following options.

**[24:35]** Satisfy one agony for each of your units in the area you choose to eliminate.

**[24:40]** Satisfy one agony for each one doom you choose to lose.

**[24:44]** Or satisfy one agony for each overdue tome you return to its slot.

**[24:50]** And again, that's going to be like a slot on the map in a tome area.

**[24:53]** If the victim does not have enough collective units doom

**[24:57]** or overdue tomes to satisfy the agony assigned to them,

**[25:00]** then the remaining agony can be ignored.

**[25:03]** When a player replaces an overdue tome to satisfy the agony

**[25:07]** and a faction currently controls a Gate in that tome's area,

**[25:11]** the player controlling that Gate immediately takes possession of the tome.

**[25:15]** Same with the custodian.

**[25:16]** No player can take control of an abandoned Gate in an area

**[25:19]** inhabited by the librarian.

**[25:21]** If the librarian is sent to an area with a controlled Gate,

**[25:24]** that Gate remains controlled for the time being.

**[25:27]** If you create a Gate in an area with the librarian,

**[25:29]** it must remain abandoned until the librarian leaves.

**[25:33]** Same with the custodian.

**[25:34]** Players cannot battle librarian.

**[25:36]** It's immune to all Spellbooks and abilities.

**[25:39]** Its only interaction is when it's activated with the silence token

**[25:42]** and it does not have a unit type.

**[25:46]** That was a lot of rules, but let's put it really simply.

**[25:49]** You can't use librarian without someone having an overdue tome,

**[25:53]** so figure out how to make that happen.

**[25:55]** I would be cooperating with the other players if you need to.

**[26:01]** I think it always feels pretty meaningful to spend your silence tokens using the librarian.

**[26:06]** Again, these tomes are extremely, extremely good.

**[26:08]** Use those silence tokens wisely to activate the librarian,

**[26:13]** and you can have some really swingy turns.

**[26:16]** Getting one or two players to successively use the librarian on somebody is very, very good,

**[26:23]** so that would be something I'm angling to do always,

**[26:27]** especially if somebody has one of those really, really strong tomes like the barrier or the larva.

**[26:32]** Last section of this library guide,

**[26:38]** just talk about maybe some general strategies on this map

**[26:41]** and some specific faction interactions.

**[26:46]** First strategy, very obvious.

**[26:48]** Get tomes.

**[26:49]** They're really good.

**[26:51]** This map kind of really sets you up to be the villain,

**[26:54]** so if you want to go for multiple tomes,

**[26:57]** you're going to be the target the entire game,

**[26:59]** but it is pretty fun.

**[27:00]** It's a heady drug because the tomes are so, so strong.

**[27:04]** Imagine having the barrier and the larvae tome at the same time.

**[27:10]** Don't mind if I do.

**[27:12]** You'll be a disgusting Elder Sign machine,

**[27:14]** and you'll also be protected by a force field.

**[27:17]** I'd say this is the most dangerous combination,

**[27:19]** and if you're an enemy of that player,

**[27:22]** just don't ever let somebody do this.

**[27:24]** Make sure you rally the other players to do whatever you can

**[27:27]** to make one or both of these overdue,

**[27:30]** and just call the librarian.

**[27:31]** Call the shit out of the librarian on somebody

**[27:33]** when they do something like that.

**[27:34]** They deserve it.

**[27:38]** Another very counterintuitive strategy

**[27:40]** would be to be above the fray

**[27:44]** and don't go for any tomes

**[27:46]** and just try to play a normal game.

**[27:49]** I wouldn't think this would work out on paper,

**[27:52]** but the last time we played on the library,

**[27:54]** my wife did exactly this,

**[27:56]** and she ended up crushing and totally dominating the game.

**[28:00]** Everyone else is probably going out of their way

**[28:02]** to either claim tomes or fight over them,

**[28:05]** and if you don't want to go after any of them,

**[28:08]** you can kind of take advantage of the confusion and the chaos

**[28:11]** and just do your normal thing pretty much uninterrupted.

**[28:14]** You're also completely immune to the librarian,

**[28:17]** so the only thing anyone can do to you

**[28:20]** is call the custodian on you,

**[28:22]** and you might not care depending on which faction you are.

**[28:26]** Some specific faction interactions here.

**[28:29]** Obviously, maybe it's not obvious, but it should be.

**[28:33]** Opener is public enemy number one.

**[28:36]** The spontaneous Gate generation is really nice

**[28:39]** for their Spellbook requirements,

**[28:40]** but mainly their unique faction ability beyond one.

**[28:44]** It makes it really trivial to move Gates into tome areas,

**[28:48]** or if there's an enemy there,

**[28:51]** you can beyond one their Gate away from the tome area,

**[28:53]** and that immediately makes their tome overdue,

**[28:56]** because they no longer control a Gate in the area.

**[28:59]** Opener extremely dangerous on this map.

**[29:01]** I would be really watching for them

**[29:03]** and targeting them with extreme prejudice,

**[29:06]** because they have a lot of potential for shenanigans here.

**[29:11]** Honorable mention to the other Gate-moving factions

**[29:14]** that we mentioned in the Dreamlands episode,

**[29:16]** Demon Sultan, who can use Animate Matter and Chaos Gate

**[29:20]** to quickly build Gates or move Gates out of tome areas,

**[29:24]** or with Animate Matter, destroy those tome Gates.

**[29:27]** That will immediately make tomes overdue,

**[29:30]** which is pretty good.

**[29:32]** Sleeper, A Distant Third.

**[29:33]** You have Cursed Slumber, you can potentially

**[29:36]** place or remove Gates from the tome areas.

**[29:41]** Other notable faction things, Chocho.

**[29:43]** You do not want them ever getting the Barrier Book

**[29:47]** or the Larvae of the Elder Gods specifically.

**[29:50]** It's just so much doom,

**[29:52]** you can't afford to not be able to fight Chocho,

**[29:54]** so watch out for that.

**[29:57]** I think that's mainly all I have for strategies.

**[30:00]** I'm sure there's a lot more I haven't mentioned.

**[30:02]** I've not played this map too, too many times,

**[30:04]** so I'm sure I'm going to keep finding things.

**[30:06]** And if you've got any interesting faction-specific interactions,

**[30:10]** definitely let me know.

**[30:11]** I'd love to hear about them.

**[30:14]** My closing thoughts on this map.

**[30:16]** It's very fun, but again, very, very chaotic.

**[30:19]** So if that's not what you're looking for,

**[30:22]** maybe avoid this one.

**[30:23]** One mark against this map might be,

**[30:27]** I do think the mechanics add enough overhead

**[30:31]** that it would be the difference between

**[30:33]** playing two games and playing one game.

**[30:35]** You might only have time to play

**[30:37]** a single game on the library,

**[30:38]** but that's where repeated plays come in nicely.

**[30:41]** I think my group's almost at the point

**[30:43]** where we could probably bang out two games

**[30:45]** in a single evening on the library if we wanted to.

**[30:47]** I would rank this map maybe medium complexity

**[30:53]** in terms of some of the other alternate maps.

**[30:57]** So I'll try to maybe assign a complexity rating

**[30:59]** for each of these as I get into these episodes.

**[31:01]** Dreamlands is pretty low.

**[31:03]** This one I would call medium.

**[31:07]** I think that's another episode in the books.

**[31:11]** Hopefully you enjoyed.

**[31:12]** Hopefully I've convinced you

**[31:14]** to play at least one game on the library.

**[31:16]** It is a wild time

**[31:18]** and I don't think you'll be disappointed.
