## Transcript

**[00:00]** It was at the dawning of one of those emerald-lit days that the object was first seen.

**[00:06]** Above the double disk on the horizon and slowly approaching their planet peered a strange,

**[00:11]** semi-spherical red globe.

**[00:14]** The edges were indistinct, while the center was a sharply defined point of crimson fire.

**[00:20]** At the time, the approach of the sphere was so unnoticeable that few of the city's inhabitants

**[00:24]** remarked it, but by the third dawn the object was much nearer, so that the race of scientists

**[00:29]** began to study it.

**[00:32]** They decided, after much speculation, that it was not a star or planet, but some species

**[00:37]** of body which was composed of no recognizable substance.

**[00:40]** The spectrum was completely unknown and the substance must have come from a region where

**[00:45]** conditions were unlike those anywhere in this universe.

**[00:49]** Because of this vagueness of its identity they were uncertain of its probable effects

**[00:53]** on their planet, for the body was heading directly for Shigai and should reach it before

**[00:58]** the suns had set thrice more.

**[01:01]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:20]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[01:23]** Hope you're doing well, wherever you are.

**[01:26]** I'm not doing great.

**[01:27]** If you heard my last episode, I was complaining about the seasonal change and feeling dry.

**[01:33]** Well, it turns out I also have COVID, so that would explain a lot.

**[01:38]** But I don't think COVID is going to keep me down from recording.

**[01:41]** This is the hardest part.

**[01:43]** The editing bit is a bit easier to do when you're not feeling well, but rest assured

**[01:47]** through the magic of editing, hopefully it doesn't sound like I'm having too hard a time

**[01:52]** getting through everything I have to say about this one.

**[01:56]** I'm going to keep the small talk pretty short because I am trying to conserve my voice.

**[02:01]** What are we talking about today?

**[02:02]** We're doing another map-specific episode to top off our Ramsey Campbell month here.

**[02:10]** And today we're talking about the Shigai map.

**[02:13]** What you heard in the intro there was a bit from the story The Insects from Shigai by

**[02:18]** Ramsey Campbell.

**[02:19]** You can find that in the cold print or the Inhabitant of the Lake and Other Unwelcome

**[02:24]** Tenants collections I mentioned in a previous episode if you want to read more about it.

**[02:29]** Basically this map is representing the destruction of the homeworld of the Insects of Shigai.

**[02:37]** I've heard this one described as Cthulhu Wars with spiked walls closing in, and that does

**[02:42]** sound pretty accurate.

**[02:44]** This is another map I actually have yet to play, so hopefully I'm going to do another

**[02:49]** before and after here where I read you about the map, tell you my initial impressions,

**[02:54]** and then I'll continue the episode a little bit later after I've played, let you know

**[02:59]** my thoughts, maybe from a little bit of a more informed point of view.

**[03:05]** This map's really beautiful to look at actually.

**[03:08]** It looks unlike any other Cthulhu Wars map.

**[03:11]** The setup is very much the same way as you would set up Cthulhu Wars on Earth, and the

**[03:16]** layout of the map wraps around the same way.

**[03:18]** So no more split-level maps like the Library or Dreamlands here.

**[03:24]** First thing you'll notice about the map is all the areas are like hexagons fitting together.

**[03:28]** I really like the way it looks, I like how colorful it is.

**[03:32]** You'll also notice the ocean areas are all in a single band going around the equator,

**[03:37]** as opposed to other maps where they're sort of spread out.

**[03:40]** They all have the ocean belt in their titles.

**[03:43]** The last thing to mention on setup is placing one Worm of Groth figure into the area labeled

**[03:49]** the Worm that Gnaws in the Night.

**[03:51]** These worms are representing the eradication that's coming to Shigai.

**[03:57]** They look pretty gross.

**[03:59]** The mouth of the worm definitely looks like something my wife pointed out to me.

**[04:04]** So I'll leave that up to your imagination what she was talking about.

**[04:09]** Like most maps in Cthulhu Wars, there is some stuff happening in the Doom Phase that

**[04:13]** doesn't normally happen in a game on Earth.

**[04:17]** In this case on Shigai, we're going to degrade our worms, which is going to let us figure

**[04:22]** out which area or areas in the map are getting destroyed, and then we're going to place new worms.

**[04:29]** First degrading worms.

**[04:30]** After all other Doom Phase events, we degrade worms.

**[04:34]** Roll one Worm Degradation die for each player.

**[04:37]** These are six-sided dice.

**[04:38]** They're pretty normal dice.

**[04:41]** Each worm has a number on its base.

**[04:43]** Each worm whose number corresponds to a rolled result is removed from the map and replaced

**[04:47]** with an eradication token, which kind of just looks like an explosion.

**[04:52]** They're orange, kind of transparent, explosion-y looking tokens.

**[04:56]** If no worm matches any rolled result, no eradication markers are placed.

**[05:01]** For example, in the first Doom Phase of a four-player game, four dice get rolled because

**[05:06]** there's four players.

**[05:08]** If there's a starting worm and it has a three on its base, and one or more dice turn up

**[05:13]** as a three, that worm gets eradicated.

**[05:17]** In each newly eradicated area, remove any Gate, cathedral, or other game marker such

**[05:23]** as an Ice Age marker.

**[05:25]** If a removed Gate was controlled by a player, that player earns one Elder Sign.

**[05:29]** A removed cathedral provides one Doom to the Ancients player.

**[05:34]** Next, you'll eliminate all units in the eradicated area.

**[05:38]** Those units' owners receive one Power for each of their units eliminated.

**[05:42]** Each faction Great Old One that is eliminated also provides its owner with one Elder Sign.

**[05:48]** And there's a little rider here for Yog specifically, since Yog-Sothoth counts as a Gate, he provides

**[05:52]** one Power and two Elder Signs if eliminated.

**[05:55]** That's pretty nice.

**[05:58]** So right away in the first Doom Phase, there's a pretty good chance of eradicating that initial

**[06:03]** worm that gnaws in the night area.

**[06:06]** I'm not good at statistics, but through my research I believe this is something like

**[06:10]** an 80% chance, so just know that going in.

**[06:13]** Things are going to get destroyed on this map more often than not, so you need to plan

**[06:17]** for that.

**[06:20]** It's very unfortunate if your Gated area is the one to get eradicated, but on this map

**[06:24]** it's nice that you at least get some compensation.

**[06:28]** You're going to get an Elder Sign if you controlled a Gate there, that's pretty nice.

**[06:31]** You're also getting paid back Power for all the units that were there.

**[06:35]** May or may not feel nice depending on the units that you lose.

**[06:38]** If they were Cultists, great, but yeah, it feels bad to lose a spawn of Yog or maybe

**[06:43]** a formless spawn from Sleeper's side.

**[06:47]** Getting the Elder Sign from the Great Old One is also pretty nice, but yeah, you're

**[06:50]** not planning to get your Great Old Ones blown up on purpose, at least I don't think so.

**[06:57]** After you've figured out all the areas which are getting eradicated, the last thing you're

**[07:02]** going to do is place new worms.

**[07:04]** Beginning with the starting player, each player places one worm either adjacent to the worm

**[07:09]** that gnaws in the night area, or adjacent to any already eradicated area.

**[07:15]** Only one worm may be placed in an area.

**[07:18]** If there are no more worms or legal areas, by the time this segment gets around to a

**[07:23]** given player, that player and any after them do not place any worms.

**[07:29]** So in a four-player game, first player is going to place a worm, and then the other

**[07:33]** three players are also placing a worm.

**[07:36]** Assuming the initial worm that gets placed during setup didn't get eradicated, there's

**[07:41]** going to be four more worms on the map, like a total of five, going into the second doom

**[07:46]** phase.

**[07:47]** That's a lot.

**[07:49]** That's a guarantee something is going to get, some things I should say, multiple areas can

**[07:53]** get eradicated.

**[07:54]** You've got to keep in mind that there's going to be a pretty good chance of that happening.

**[08:00]** Definitely feeling the spiked walls closing in as I read about the eradications here.

**[08:07]** That's the main effect on this map that happens in the doom phase.

**[08:11]** There's a couple other bits of the map to talk about.

**[08:15]** Just the effects of the worms of groth before they eradicate an area.

**[08:20]** Aside from being replaced by

**[08:21]** eradication markers at the end of the doom phase, worms by themselves don't do anything.

**[08:26]** They can't be battled, eliminated, or otherwise interacted with in any way.

**[08:31]** So that's good to know, they can't be battled away or anything, but they do give us something

**[08:35]** just by being around, and that's the cosmic Power.

**[08:39]** A player controlling a Gate in an area that contains a worm can tap into the cosmic Power.

**[08:45]** As an action, you can place any Spellbook, including those of independent Great Old Ones,

**[08:50]** simply by spending 6 Power instead of meeting that Spellbook's requirement.

**[08:55]** Thanks to the cosmic Power, you need never fear eradication depriving you of a potential

**[08:59]** Spellbook.

**[09:00]** It's usually cheaper to earn Spellbooks the old-fashioned way, though.

**[09:03]** In addition, when you control a Gate in an area with a worm, you may bypass area restrictions

**[09:09]** on awakening or summoning your units by paying 2 additional Power.

**[09:13]** All other awakening or summoning requirements must still be met.

**[09:17]** By controlling a Gate in a worm's area, the cosmic Power also allows the ancient's cathedrals

**[09:22]** to be placed similarly.

**[09:25]** So this means you could potentially place a cathedral in that same, let's say the scratching

**[09:30]** glyph, you could place a second cathedral in a scratching glyph area by paying 2 extra

**[09:34]** Power.

**[09:35]** It's probably costing you 3 to 5 Power to do that, but that's good to know, something

**[09:40]** that you can do there.

**[09:42]** This paragraph goes on to say the ancients can earn Spellbooks the same way with the

**[09:46]** substitution, so if you haven't, for example, placed a cathedral in that chevron glyph area

**[09:51]** and there are no more chevron glyph areas, you can just pay 6 Power instead of having

**[09:56]** to try to earn that unearnable requirement.

**[10:00]** And the last thing it says here is Boobastis is allowed to use this pay 6 Power rule, but

**[10:04]** not the pay 2 Power rule, even though the moon can't have a worm.

**[10:09]** Cats are like that.

**[10:11]** So that was like a lot to get through, but let me break it down as simply as possible.

**[10:18]** So we can like quote unquote shortcut our Spellbook requirements on this map, but it's

**[10:22]** not very cheap to do that.

**[10:26]** Mainly this is a workaround for Spellbook requirements that maybe can't be met after

**[10:30]** areas get eradicated.

**[10:33]** Having said that, I do think there are some Spellbook requirements it might be nice to

**[10:36]** just pay 6 Power and avoid earning the old-fashioned way.

**[10:40]** Two that come to mind for me would be like being in 8 areas with black goats.

**[10:44]** Paying 6 Power seems kind of nice to not have to do that.

**[10:47]** Also 12 Gates on the map for opener would be pretty nice to just pay 6 Power instead

**[10:52]** of having to maybe build a bunch of Gates yourself.

**[10:56]** And yeah, maybe also like a ritual with sleeper perhaps if they're already 7 or 8 Power might

**[11:02]** be a little cheaper just to pay the 6, though you won't be getting the doom obviously.

**[11:08]** The awakening shortcuts are similarly useful.

**[11:11]** So for example, Great Cthulhu is never going to be locked out of awakening now just because

**[11:16]** their starting area, the South Pacific area if you will, got eradicated for example.

**[11:23]** So interesting mechanic here.

**[11:25]** Paying 6 Power, I'm interested to see how that plays out.

**[11:28]** If people are going to use that out of convenience, or rather out of necessity, I'm not really

**[11:32]** sure.

**[11:33]** I will report back later.

**[11:37]** Last part on this map is those eradication markers.

**[11:40]** Once they get placed, what do they do?

**[11:43]** Once an eradication marker has been placed in an area, no units or gameplay pieces may

**[11:47]** be moved to or placed into that area.

**[11:51]** These areas are considered to be completely gone.

**[11:54]** If you have units adjacent to an eradicated area, you may move through that area, in effect

**[12:12]** skipping over it to another area adjacent to it.

**[12:16]** However, one of the units making the move is eliminated when you do this, so don't move

**[12:21]** a single unit over an eradicated area.

**[12:25]** You can move any number of units over any number of eradicated areas and from multiple

**[12:29]** areas and still lose only one unit in total for that entire move action.

**[12:36]** Movement like abilities or Spellbooks which let you relocate without passing through areas

**[12:41]** don't cause you to lose a unit.

**[12:43]** So for example, Submerge and Avatar are not going to cost you a unit, even if the travel

**[12:48]** originates in an area surrounded by eradication tokens.

**[12:53]** However, movement like abilities which do not teleport, like Screaming Dead, do still

**[12:58]** force the user to eliminate a unit.

**[13:01]** Units cannot be retreated into or through eradicated areas.

**[13:05]** If units cannot be retreated, then one unit is eliminated per the normal battle rule.

**[13:13]** So right away on this map we're going to be having these gaps of eradicated areas.

**[13:17]** They might sort of slice the map in half.

**[13:20]** I'm not sure what to expect.

**[13:21]** You might have islands of areas surrounded by eradicated areas.

**[13:26]** Very interested to see how that unfolds.

**[13:29]** You can move through them, but it's going to cost a unit.

**[13:31]** So not great, but we do what we got to do to get our Spellbooks right.

**[13:37]** So to me, moving through eradication seems like a purely negative thing on the surface,

**[13:41]** but I could also maybe see this used advantageously.

**[13:45]** Like maybe a less mobile faction like a Chocho is using this to just get out of dodge and

**[13:51]** get effectively a few spaces away from another predatory faction that wants to hurt them.

**[13:57]** Maybe they could do that in a pinch.

**[13:59]** But not really stopping anybody from being followed either, so I'm not sure how useful

**[14:02]** that's going to be.

**[14:06]** Last thing on this map, the world's end.

**[14:10]** It's possible for a Shugai game to reach the point where the world is basically falling

**[14:13]** apart, making it difficult to win.

**[14:15]** If the total of non-eradicated areas ever reaches fewer than two per player, the game

**[14:21]** immediately ends and the player with the most doom wins, as long as they have all six Spellbooks.

**[14:27]** If the game ends and no player has all six Spellbooks, then no one wins.

**[14:31]** Shugai's final catastrophe ruins it for everyone.

**[14:34]** I'm not going to lie, I kind of want to see this happen or, you know, get pretty close

**[14:38]** to it.

**[14:40]** If you are listening to this and you have played on Shugai a bunch of times, please

**[14:43]** send me your epic Shugai stories.

**[14:46]** I would love to hear about how you got close to winning, but then the world's end happened

**[14:51]** and you couldn't win, or you managed to win right before the end, or you managed to be

**[14:56]** the only player with all their Spellbooks at the time the world fell apart.

**[14:59]** I want to hear about all that, I'm pretty curious.

**[15:04]** And yeah, I think that's all that I really have to say about Shugai before sitting down

**[15:08]** to play it for the first time myself.

**[15:11]** On the surface it seems like one of the least complex maps, so that's pretty nice to know

**[15:16]** in advance, but how's the gameplay going to feel?

**[15:19]** I generally see people not badmouthing this map, but it's not usually mentioned as people's

**[15:24]** favorite, so I'm interested to see how it's going to go and what I might be able to do

**[15:30]** when I play there.

**[15:32]** One thing I'm particularly interested in trying is maybe Demon Sultan intentionally

**[15:38]** throwing away Chaos Gates and Avatars to the worms, just trying to get paid in Elder Signs

**[15:44]** and not really losing out on all that much.

**[15:47]** That seems a pretty interesting strategy to go for.

**[15:50]** I'll let you know how it goes, and I will rest up and play on the map and talk to you

**[15:56]** a little later.

**[16:02]** Hi, it's me again.

**[16:08]** I'm back.

**[16:09]** It's about 24 hours after the initial recording.

**[16:12]** Didn't expect to make this so soon, but I was able to get together with some people

**[16:16]** online on Tabletop Simulator, and we did play on the Shugai map for the first time.

**[16:24]** Huge shoutout to Matt, Griffin, and David for volunteering to play on this map with

**[16:29]** me for the first time.

**[16:30]** It was everybody's first time on the map.

**[16:33]** Matt moved away, so we haven't been able to play together in real life for quite a while,

**[16:37]** but it was very pleasant to play online together, and I think we'll be doing it again, so looking

**[16:41]** forward to that.

**[16:42]** We had a nice time on Shigai. We had in the game Sleeper, Opener, Crawling Chaos,

**[16:50]** and I was playing as Demon Sultan. I end up winning at 32 doom. We had Crawling

**[16:57]** Chaos at 24, Sleeper at 23, and Opener bringing up the rear at 17. It was a very

**[17:05]** violent game. Toward the end of the game there was only one Great Old One in play

**[17:09]** right at the very end. That was the Toad. And yeah, I think everybody including me

**[17:15]** had a pretty favorable view of the map. So I'll try to do something similar to

**[17:20]** the Dunwich Horror episode where I revisit each part of the map and how my

**[17:25]** opinions may be changed or gotten a little bit more informed. Doom phase

**[17:31]** stuff, degrading all the worms, eradicating areas, placing new worms. That

**[17:35]** was a lot of fun. Everybody was pretty excited every time that rolled around

**[17:39]** to figure out what was going to happen. I did end up going for that Demon Sultan

**[17:44]** strategy I mentioned in the initial recording, leaving Thesis behind along

**[17:49]** with a Chaos Gate to get destroyed. I did that several times to earn several Elder

**[17:54]** Signs so that felt pretty nice but definitely didn't feel unfair. Giving up

**[17:58]** your Great Old One for any reason is not usually ideal and that includes Thesis,

**[18:04]** especially since Crawling Chaos was in the game. My avatars started getting

**[18:08]** hunted and it became clear to me I wasn't going to be able to get away with

**[18:12]** doing that kind of thing many times. I only ended up ritualing one time in the

**[18:17]** whole game and I felt like the Elder Signs I got from the worms, destroying my

**[18:21]** Gates, and Thesis a few times made up for that. The pattern of the worms

**[18:27]** expanding away from the center of the board was not nearly as predictable as I

**[18:32]** thought it was going to be. The worms were on player's Gates right away that

**[18:36]** they didn't really count on and yeah that made for some exciting gameplay.

**[18:41]** There were some exciting eradications too. Poor Crawling Chaos did a great job

**[18:47]** of clawing their way back into the game after a very unfortunate eradication

**[18:52]** early on that ended up hitting a bunch of their units and Crawling Chaos but

**[18:56]** the nice thing was that they did get paid like seven Power and an Elder Sign

**[19:00]** for their trouble so yes it was like not ideal not even close to ideal but

**[19:04]** they did get compensated and it did make good use of all that Power to stay in

**[19:09]** the game and actually end up with a pretty respectable second place in the

**[19:12]** end. That whole guessing game of like will the worms destroy my stuff or won't

**[19:18]** they that was pretty exciting. I was like I said trying to get my stuff destroyed

**[19:23]** by worms several times. It only ended up happening a single time which was a

**[19:27]** little disappointing and there was a couple cases of heavily populated areas

**[19:31]** getting eradicated and people are not counting on that happening. I also think

**[19:37]** I way undervalued the Power and Elder Signs gotten from the Gated areas being

**[19:45]** eradicated by the worms. By the end of the game I was really trying to not only

**[19:49]** take that into account but like I was planning on getting a Gate destroyed

**[19:53]** that had three or four units there because I knew that would pay for like

**[19:57]** most of the ritual I was planning on doing anyway so that's something to keep

**[20:01]** in mind playing on this map for sure. If you're planning on ritualing maybe like

**[20:05]** plan on throwing some units under the bus in an eradication because that is

**[20:09]** gonna rebate you on maybe most of the cost of a ritual depending on how

**[20:13]** expensive they are. As far as the cosmic Power I believe

**[20:18]** Opener used cosmic Power to pay for their 12 Gates book so that was probably

**[20:24]** a good idea on their part. I was tempted to do it at one point just to get

**[20:29]** unlimited combat. My missing spell book at the time was Abandoned Gate on the

**[20:34]** map during Gathered Power and I thought it was just gonna be a little bit too

**[20:36]** expensive so I didn't end up going for it. The spread of eradication over the

**[20:43]** game was pretty cool. There ended up being like a pretty nice swath like

**[20:48]** cutting through the middle of the map pretty early on so just a full line

**[20:52]** slicing like the northwestern half and the southeastern half of the map from

**[20:57]** each other. Felt isolating. It was like Demon Sultan and the Toad were up in the

**[21:02]** left and Opener and Crawling Chaos were down in the right side. Kept remarking

**[21:09]** that I didn't think Crawling Chaos was gonna be willing to cross the

**[21:12]** eradication but I was totally wrong about that. Griffin proved me wrong.

**[21:16]** Narlathotep and a couple of friends, a couple of brave soldiers, crossed the

**[21:21]** eradication. Not only did they cross but they went on to do a train of pain and

**[21:27]** made all Demon Sultan avatars extinct alongside Sothogua and Opener just

**[21:33]** wiping out all great old ones earning I believe it was like six Elder Signs in

**[21:37]** one turn and then taking their doom score from kind of a middling score up

**[21:42]** to the mid 20s and they were definitely in position to win the game did I not

**[21:47]** win in the doom phase so pretty exciting game. We did have like somewhat of a time

**[21:52]** limit too so I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of complexity of the map. All

**[21:58]** these players have probably played I don't know 20 games probably more but it

**[22:02]** was nice everyone was able to pick up the rules right away nobody was really

**[22:05]** asking tons of questions during the game as opposed to something like maybe

**[22:08]** Yuggoth. Yeah I would recommend it I'm not sure I'd play on it every time but

**[22:14]** definitely is a fun change up. The areas disappearing and all the chaos that goes

**[22:19]** along with that. So I think that's all that I have for this episode on Shaggai.

**[22:26]** Ended up being quite a treat to play on the map so I would recommend it. Thanks

**[22:31]** for listening hopefully you found this useful. Rate, review, and subscribe if you

**[23:23]** On the third day the globe was a huge red glow in the sky blotting out the

**[23:28]** green suns and lighting everything with a crimson flame but no heat emanated

**[23:33]** from it and no other evidence of its existence met the insects besides the

**[23:38]** blood-red light. They were uneasy for the menacing sphere in the heavens was very

**[23:43]** disturbing and therefore many of them visited the triangular temple frequently

**[23:48]** for private worship. The being in my body had been one of those frequent

**[23:52]** visitors and owed its life to being in the temple when the cataclysm struck. It

**[23:57]** entered under the arched portal where a protocolus like sheet of translucent

**[24:02]** mineral would fall at any external threat to protect the tenant inside. As

**[24:07]** the insect made to leave the temple after that act which it must practice

**[24:11]** before the tenant of the pyramid it saw a prolonged crimson flash in the sky

**[24:16]** speedily approaching the ground while at the same time the protective shield

**[24:20]** crashed down in the temple entrance. The 40 or so other beings which were also at

**[24:26]** worship clattered to stare through the shield at what was happening in the city

**[24:30]** outside. As the red glow faded the buildings became again visible as did

**[24:36]** the beings in the streets. The creatures and buildings had changed in some way

**[24:39]** during the cataclysm but they glowed with that same crimson light streaming

**[24:44]** from inside each and the light became every moment brighter changing from red

**[24:49]** orange blinding yellow to white as the insect beings rised and clawed at

**[24:54]** themselves in helpless agony.
