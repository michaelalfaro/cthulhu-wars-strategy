## Transcript

**[00:00]** They, or their principal ancestral element, had first been found in a wild state amidst

**[00:06]** the cyclopean ruins of the deserted red-litten world of Joth, which lay below the blue-litten

**[00:11]** world of Kinyan.

**[00:14]** The part of them was human seemed quite clear, but men of science could never decide whether

**[00:18]** they were actually the descendants of the bygone entities who had lived and reigned

**[00:22]** in the strange ruins.

**[00:25]** The chief ground for such a supposition was the well-known fact that the vanished inhabitants

**[00:29]** of Joth had been quadrupedal.

**[00:32]** This much was known from the very few manuscripts and carvings found in the vaults of Zin beneath

**[00:37]** the largest ruined city of Joth.

**[00:40]** But it was also known from these manuscripts that the beings of Joth had possessed the

**[00:44]** art of synthetically creating life and had made and destroyed several efficiently designed

**[00:49]** races of industrial and transportational animals in the course of their history.

**[00:54]** To say nothing of concocting all manner of fantastic living shapes for the sake of amusement

**[01:00]** and new sensations during the long period of decadence.

**[01:04]** The beings of Joth had undoubtedly been reptilian in affiliations, and most physiologists of

**[01:10]** Sath agreed that the present beast had been very much inclined toward reptilianism before

**[01:16]** they had been crossed with the mammal slave class of Kinyan.

**[01:35]** Hello and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:43]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[01:46]** Hope you're doing well wherever you are.

**[01:49]** I'm doing great.

**[01:50]** I'm looking forward very much to a vacation for me that starts at the end of this week,

**[01:56]** and I'll be gone for a week.

**[01:57]** I'll be in Sandbridge, Virginia.

**[02:00]** It's about 20 minutes from Virginia Beach.

**[02:03]** Highly recommend if you've never been.

**[02:05]** My family's been going there for years.

**[02:08]** My family is all aware of this podcast by this point, and they may even have listened

**[02:14]** to some of it, and I'm happy to say I am bringing along Cthulhu Wars for the ride.

**[02:19]** I was able to somehow Tetris in the first seven factions plus the library map plus the

**[02:26]** Dreamlands map, so I'll be bringing those along with me.

**[02:30]** Maybe I'll be playing the drunkest Cthulhu Wars you've ever heard of, and I'll report

**[02:34]** back.

**[02:37]** One more piece of Sandbridge trivia and opening-the-way trivia in case you were ever wondering, what

**[02:42]** is the logo for this podcast?

**[02:44]** What's it from?

**[02:46]** It's actually from last year when we were at Sandbridge.

**[02:50]** My wife took that picture when we were walking around in the middle of the night on the beach.

**[02:56]** So if you don't know, now you know what that's from.

**[03:00]** I'll be away for probably like 10 days, so if the episode content this month is a little

**[03:06]** bit light, that's probably why, but everyone deserves a vacation, even from a podcast.

**[03:13]** What are we talking about today?

**[03:15]** I'm excited to bring another faction guide to the table, this time about the Ancients.

**[03:21]** This is a very weird faction.

**[03:25]** You heard in the opening there what I think is the source material for the Ancients.

**[03:29]** This is the mound by HP Lovecraft and Hazel Heald.

**[03:34]** It goes into great detail about the subterranean race that lives under the ground.

**[03:38]** It also goes into great detail about Yig and the snakes.

**[03:43]** Lots of stuff in that story.

**[03:45]** Not the best Lovecraft story in the world, definitely has some pretty bad caricatures

**[03:50]** of Native Americans in the United States, but does lay out some nice lore for these

**[03:56]** more obscure things in the mythos, the Ancients being one of them.

**[04:01]** Let's talk about the faction.

**[04:03]** This faction is very weird.

**[04:05]** The first thing, if you are at all familiar with the Ancients, you'll probably already

**[04:08]** know this.

**[04:09]** This faction does not have any Great Old Ones.

**[04:13]** We've talked about factions with one, two, and even three Great Old Ones up to this point,

**[04:18]** but this faction has none of them.

**[04:20]** If you don't know that much about Cthulhu Wars, you might be thinking to yourself right

**[04:25]** now like, how is that even possible?

**[04:28]** There's this fundamental thing that you learned really early on in Cthulhu Wars about how

**[04:33]** to make your Gates safe from other players.

**[04:36]** One of those is having a Great Old One at your Gate protects it from other Great Old

**[04:41]** Ones, at least as far as your Cultists being captured.

**[04:45]** Ancients don't have any Great Old Ones like that, so there's nothing that prevents people

**[04:49]** from capturing their Cultists.

**[04:52]** So when you're playing this faction, you're going to have to figure out exactly how to

**[04:56]** ward off the other Great Old Ones that are at the table, but the good news is the Ancients

**[05:01]** do have some tools in their kit in order to accomplish that.

**[05:06]** Some of the pros of not having a Great Old One, all the units for this faction are extremely

**[05:10]** cheap, so you'll find that you're rarely, if ever, needing to quote-unquote take a turn

**[05:16]** off to summon, in this case, your most expensive units.

**[05:20]** None of your stuff is very costly.

**[05:24]** How else can you make up for this shortcoming against other Great Old Ones?

**[05:27]** I would say your main tools are social engineering, which we will go into in great detail.

**[05:34]** You've got several angles there, and you've also got a little bit of a rattlesnake-like

**[05:39]** ability in Unholy Ground, which we'll talk a lot more about.

**[05:44]** You can use that ability reactively to protect your Gates, threaten Great Old Ones, or you

**[05:48]** can even use it proactively and be a huge jerk, and I'll tell you all about that a little

**[05:53]** later.

**[05:55]** This faction is really going to reward you if you're good at talking, table talking,

**[06:00]** getting people to do favors for you, doing favors for other people.

**[06:04]** You might have a bit of a harder time if you're not as sociable when you play, you don't have

**[06:08]** good table talk, you're probably going to struggle to play this faction to its fullest

**[06:13]** potential.

**[06:16]** Another key piece about the Ancients that separates them from most other factions, they

**[06:20]** have their own special buildings, cathedrals, which can coexist in an area with a Gate.

**[06:27]** They can potentially provide you and your opponents with extra Power via their Worship

**[06:32]** Services Spellbook, that's a little bit of the social engineering there, and you'll be

**[06:36]** able to maybe snipe Great Old Ones in battle against you with your Unholy Ground Spellbook.

**[06:43]** Ancients are also a very mobile faction.

**[06:46]** Their unique ability we'll talk about, Dematerialization, allows them to kind of teleport around the

**[06:50]** map.

**[06:52]** They tend to do a lot of battling, it's the only way for you to protect your Gates is

**[06:56]** by battling.

**[06:58]** They've always reminded me quite a bit of the South Park episode, it's the one where

**[07:03]** Russell Crowe is picking fights with everybody around the world.

**[07:07]** I'm not going to do my Russell Crowe impression for you, I will just say, foughtin' around

**[07:13]** the world.

**[07:14]** So, if you know that episode, you know what I'm talking about.

**[07:17]** That's kind of what I imagine the Ancients are doing here.

**[07:20]** They have nothing else to do but fight people, beat them down, and take their Gates and win

**[07:25]** the game.

**[07:29]** And with the opening thoughts out of the way, we'll go ahead and get into the setup for

**[07:33]** the Ancients.

**[07:35]** This faction sets up after all factions other than Cho's, Windwalker, and Opener of the

**[07:40]** Way.

**[07:41]** They've got 8 Power, 6 acolytes, and a controlled Gate in any area containing no game symbol.

**[07:48]** So that means like anybody's starting glyph, you can still place yourself and set up in

**[07:53]** an area that has one of the three glyphs that you might associate with Yellow Sign, like

**[07:58]** the Scratching Glyph, the Chevron Glyph, the Ouroboros Glyph, the circular, spirally one.

**[08:05]** There's also some specific rules on other maps for the Ancients, I'll just quickly touch

**[08:10]** on them, though I do write these guides in such a way where I assume that you're playing

**[08:14]** on Earth.

**[08:16]** Primeval map, Ancients can't set up where there's a glacier, don't worry about that

**[08:20]** if you don't know what that means.

**[08:22]** Dreamlands, Ancients can't set up in an area with a citadel, cool.

**[08:26]** Yoggoth map, Ancients cannot set up in the Slime Sea, or on the Overlook, or on the Green

**[08:31]** Pyramid, or in the Laboratory, as all those areas are marked with a game symbol.

**[08:37]** Library map, Ancients cannot set up in a special collection room, I'm assuming that means where

**[08:41]** you pick up the tomes, it's kind of strange.

**[08:44]** On the Shigai map, the Ancients cannot set up on the Worm that Gnaws in the Night area,

**[08:50]** but why would you want to?

**[08:53]** Last thing on setup for the Ancients, depending on the other factions in the game, this is

**[08:57]** another case of deciding several things.

**[09:01]** Do you want to be close to people, or do you want to be far away from them, and are you

**[09:06]** going to be more of a social engineering style of play, team player, or are you going to

**[09:13]** be more of a bully that pushes people away from their Gates and takes them for yourself?

**[09:19]** Think about that when you're setting up, choose your role.

**[09:22]** I'll talk more about this in the opening section of the guide and playing the Ancients.

**[09:30]** On to the unique faction ability for Ancients, that is Dematerialization.

**[09:36]** In the Doom phase, relocate any or all of your own units from one single area

**[09:40]** area, to a single other area anywhere on the map.

**[09:45]** This ability is amazing, I would definitely say it's among the best movement abilities

**[09:49]** in the game, maybe also in the top 3 or 5 faction abilities in the game straight out.

**[09:56]** You can grab a ton of units with this at one time, and teleport anywhere you need to go.

**[10:01]** Imagine you're playing a larger game, there's more areas on the map, doesn't matter, dematerialization

**[10:07]** can take you literally anywhere with no restrictions, other than you can only take your units from

**[10:12]** one area into only one other area.

**[10:16]** Again, not getting too into the ancient strategies here, but some things you can do with dematerialization,

**[10:24]** you can grab one or only a few units if you want to be nice to somebody and build a cathedral

**[10:31]** somewhere for them, more on that in a second, or if you can try to predict the future a

**[10:36]** little bit, consider who's going to be the first player, start lobbying them if needed

**[10:41]** to influence the turn order.

**[10:44]** The turn order can be really huge for the ancients and this ability, it can be the difference

**[10:48]** between being able to take the first action before somebody else, and getting a battle

**[10:53]** off, that can be a huge deal for you, possibly getting a great old one out of your way, or

**[10:59]** moving back to safety.

**[11:02]** And before we go any further in the guide onto units or Spellbook requirements, I must

**[11:08]** talk about cathedrals.

**[11:10]** I don't want to trap myself the way I felt like I did in the yellow sign guide, as everything

**[11:14]** was so interconnected I didn't know what order to put things in.

**[11:18]** I'm just going to do the cathedrals right now.

**[11:22]** These are a new type of building specific to the ancients.

**[11:26]** You don't get great old ones as this faction, you get these buildings instead.

**[11:30]** They're very unusual, you're going to need to rely on them in order to do some combination

**[11:35]** of social engineering or threatening enemy great old ones.

**[11:41]** They give me a lot of, if you've ever played Castlevania, they give me a lot of Dracula's

**[11:46]** Castle vibes looking at them.

**[11:49]** Really cool looking architecture on these.

**[11:52]** You've got four cathedrals in the pool, they cost three Power to construct, only one Power

**[11:59]** if they're not built adjacent to another cathedral.

**[12:03]** They have several Spellbooks that work with them that we'll talk more about, worship services,

**[12:08]** consecration, and unholy ground.

**[12:12]** Cathedrals also have a special ability, if all four of them are in play, you may awaken

**[12:17]** an independent great old one without having your own great old one.

**[12:22]** And if you're awakening Cthugha for some reason specifically, you will just end up paying

**[12:26]** six Power.

**[12:28]** That's cool if you have a little bit of a carve out with this faction.

**[12:31]** If you are playing with neutral units, ancients do have a way of awakening independent great

**[12:36]** old ones if needed.

**[12:39]** When performing the create Gate action as the ancients, you can construct either a cathedral

**[12:43]** or a Gate.

**[12:44]** As with Gates, you must have a Cultist in the selected area.

**[12:49]** A cathedral can be placed in the same area as a Gate following these restrictions.

**[12:53]** Only one cathedral can be placed in an area containing that clog glyph.

**[12:58]** Only one cathedral can be placed in an area containing the V-shaped chevron glyph.

**[13:03]** Only one cathedral can be placed in an area containing the spirally ouroboros glyph.

**[13:08]** And only one cathedral can be placed in an area that does not contain any of those three

**[13:12]** glyphs.

**[13:13]** This is a very easy rule to miss.

**[13:17]** Just note that it only applies in building cathedrals in Gated areas specifically.

**[13:24]** Very weird.

**[13:25]** Very easy to miss.

**[13:27]** Doesn't actually come up all that often.

**[13:28]** I totally wasn't even aware of this rule.

**[13:31]** Make sure you're aware of this.

**[13:32]** Make sure your opponents are on top of it too so nobody makes a whoopsie.

**[13:36]** Cannot build, for example, there's two Gates both in an area with the chevron glyph.

**[13:41]** You cannot build a cathedral in each of those areas.

**[13:45]** Only in one at a time.

**[13:48]** Last rule on cathedrals, unlike Gates, you do not control them as the ancients.

**[13:53]** They always belong to you even if you have no units in the area.

**[13:57]** Cathedrals themselves, though, are not units and they cannot participate in any battles.

**[14:04]** Let's move on to the Spellbook requirements for the ancients.

**[14:07]** This is probably going to be a very quick section because I think I can talk about these,

**[14:11]** most of them as a group.

**[14:14]** First category of Spellbook requirements is building cathedrals around the world.

**[14:19]** You've got four Spellbook requirements here.

**[14:22]** Building a cathedral in an area with a claw scratching glyph.

**[14:26]** Building a cathedral in an area with a chevron glyph.

**[14:30]** Building a cathedral in an area with a ouroboros glyph.

**[14:34]** Or building a cathedral in an area with none of those glyphs.

**[14:38]** Those are four different Spellbook requirements.

**[14:40]** They all are involving you to do the same thing, building a cathedral.

**[14:45]** Recall from the cathedral rules, these do cost three Power to build if they're adjacent

**[14:50]** to each other.

**[14:51]** So ideally, when you're taking these Spellbook requirements, you're doing so a few spaces

**[14:55]** apart from another cathedral so that you only need to pay one Power to construct.

**[15:01]** Of course, you can move your acolytes into the right areas to build these cathedrals,

**[15:08]** but don't forget about dematerialization, which can really save you Power on moving

**[15:14]** into the right area.

**[15:15]** You can do it for free if you choose to move in the doom phase.

**[15:20]** Last thing, this faction can earn its Spellbooks very quickly, maybe only rivaled by the chocho,

**[15:26]** so you don't need to rush on getting all four of these or feel the need to walk alone acolyte

**[15:33]** spending multiple Power to walk onto an enemy Gate.

**[15:37]** Talk to somebody before you do this.

**[15:39]** It can be risky if you're playing with somebody that has no honor and they want to capture

**[15:43]** you.

**[15:45]** You're always running your mouth as this faction.

**[15:50]** Last two Spellbook requirements for the ancients are involving giving away free monsters.

**[15:56]** You've got each player summons their lowest cost monster for free, and each player summons

**[16:01]** their highest cost monster for free.

**[16:05]** Each of those is an action, and you'll take a Spellbook whenever you offer that up to

**[16:09]** the other players.

**[16:11]** Some specifics on each.

**[16:12]** The lowest cost monster for free, I think it's worth doing pretty early, but it depends

**[16:17]** on what sort of opening you want to do more on that later.

**[16:21]** Waiting on this can be potentially quote-unquote bad if people have already summoned their

**[16:26]** cheapest monsters from their pools, and you end up giving them something a bit more expensive

**[16:31]** instead.

**[16:32]** Imagine, for example, you use this on the sleeper player, but they've already summoned

**[16:38]** all their wizards and their serpentmen, and you end up giving them a formless spawn for

**[16:42]** free.

**[16:43]** Feels kind of bad.

**[16:45]** Last one, each player summons their highest cost monster for free.

**[16:49]** If you can manage to wait on this one until one or more players already have their most

**[16:53]** expensive units on the map, and that they don't get one for free, great.

**[16:57]** So a little bit of the opposite of the other one.

**[17:00]** So another example, if Opener of the Way happens to already have both of their spawns out,

**[17:06]** maybe it's nice to take this and they only get an abomination.

**[17:11]** Last thing on these two Spellbooks, shoutout to being mean to Demon Sultan, who probably

**[17:16]** deserves it.

**[17:18]** This faction doesn't start on the map.

**[17:19]** They probably won't have a Gate right away, so if you take either one of these and somebody

**[17:24]** doesn't have a Gate built on the map, they don't get anything.

**[17:26]** So keep that in mind, this is a funny way, a mean way, of denying Demon Sultan some monsters

**[17:33]** by taking these books before they actually have a Gate built.

**[17:39]** And that's the Spellbook requirements out of the way, so we'll move on to the units.

**[17:44]** First thing is the Ancient's Acolytes.

**[17:47]** They're kind of endearing looking, they look like little pilots, they're holding something

**[17:51]** in their hand.

**[17:52]** They look like they're like, look, I found it!

**[17:55]** They look innocent.

**[17:57]** They're not.

**[17:58]** They can really get up to some shenanigans by building those cathedrals, and we'll keep

**[18:03]** talking more about that.

**[18:06]** There's not too much else to say.

**[18:08]** There's no Spellbooks that actually work with the Ancient's Acolytes.

**[18:12]** Just keep in mind you can move them around with dematerialization.

**[18:16]** General tip on Ancients, I would avoid getting your Acolytes captured for no reason.

**[18:23]** The Power can be kind of tight for this faction from time to time, so you don't want to miss

**[18:27]** out on having one of your units captured or in your pool, because every Power can matter

**[18:33]** on certain turns.

**[18:36]** Next unit for the Ancients, we've got the Unmen.

**[18:42]** The Old Ones knew how to make a corpse into an automaton which would last almost indefinitely

**[18:46]** and perform any sort of work when directed by streams of thought.

**[18:50]** Charging Buffalo said that the people had all come to talk by means of thought only,

**[18:55]** speech having been found crude and needless, except for religious devotions and emotional

**[18:59]** expression as aeons of discovery and study rolled by.

**[19:03]** They worshipped Yig, the great father of serpents, and Tulu, the octopus-headed entity that had

**[19:09]** brought them down from the stars.

**[19:11]** Yes, our next unit is the Unmen.

**[19:15]** They look pretty disgusting, like they're not quite human.

**[19:20]** The Ancients are doomed.

**[19:21]** all kind of scientific and genetic experimentation down there. These look

**[19:26]** like they're not quite there on the humanity side of things. Very spindly

**[19:32]** looking legs and arms. Looks like it might have been human some generations

**[19:37]** ago but no longer. You've got three unmen in your pool. They cost three Power

**[19:43]** normally, they cost only zero with the festival Spellbook, and they have zero

**[19:48]** combat. Zero combat what? Very bad, but you know remember having a monster, just

**[19:56]** a monster, is good enough to defend a Gate even if it can't declare battle on

**[19:59]** its own. It's still good enough to protect from other monsters. Once you

**[20:06]** have your festival Spellbook, these will cost zero Power and you'll have a way to

**[20:09]** give away some Power to a lucky opponent, so choose wisely. If you do, these can

**[20:17]** give you, you know, repeated zero cost summon actions if you can manage to get

**[20:22]** them back into your pool and give Power away to the right player. Next unit for

**[20:29]** the ancients, we have the reanimated. Upon reaching the plane, Zamacona saw the

**[20:36]** larger forms and noted the almost human work performed by the repulsive horned

**[20:41]** Gya-Yothin. He likewise observed the more manlike shapes that toiled along the

**[20:46]** furrows and felt a curious fright and disgust toward certain of them whose

**[20:50]** motions were more mechanical than those of the rest. These, Gyal-Kha-Yun explained,

**[20:57]** were what men called the Yun-Bai, organisms which had died but which had

**[21:02]** been mechanically reanimated for industrial purposes by means of atomic

**[21:06]** energy and thought Power. Yeah the reanimated, they also look very gross

**[21:12]** like they were once humans but now they have been kind of augmented with

**[21:17]** machinery. I'm getting a bit of a like Borg from Star Trek vibe by looking at

**[21:22]** this. Looks like this reanimated can't breathe on its own, it's got some sort of

**[21:26]** an oxygen tube and it's got these big mechanical attachments to its arms.

**[21:32]** Pretty disturbing looking, again, kind of like the An-Men. You've got three

**[21:38]** reanimated in your pool, they cost four Power normally, they'll cost only one

**[21:43]** when you have your brainless Spellbook, and they have two combat. Another weird

**[21:49]** unit, only two combat they have and most of the time because of their brainless

**[21:54]** Spellbook you're gonna need to have other non-reanimated units in the area

**[21:58]** if you want to move or capture or battle with these. Seems bad like a drawback and

**[22:04]** it definitely is, but remember your dematerialization ability. These are

**[22:09]** actually a pretty nice rate of two combat dice for only one Power once you

**[22:13]** get the brainless book. The last unit for the ancients we have the Jothans. Heard a

**[22:21]** bit about them in the intro there. They look pretty cool if you like lizards, if

**[22:27]** you like dinosaurs. These are like a nice dinosaur dog looking things. They look

**[22:34]** very mean, they look very strong, they're crouched down ready to pounce. They look

**[22:40]** like they have some chonk on them and they definitely do. You've got three of

**[22:46]** them in your pool, they cost six Power to summon normally, only three with their

**[22:50]** extinction Spellbook. Wow. And they have a combat of seven dice, so let that sink

**[22:57]** in for a minute. Seven dice, whoa. Yeah, Jothans are chonks. They're not great old

**[23:03]** ones, but they sure do hit like them. These are not monsters, they are terrors.

**[23:10]** So quick recap on terrors, basically the same thing as monsters, however no

**[23:17]** abilities that affect monsters can affect terrors. So just some examples,

**[23:21]** can't use invisibility on terrors, they're not monsters. Cthulhu cannot

**[23:25]** devour Jothans because they're not monsters. The Spellbook that works with

**[23:31]** Jothans is extinction. It makes them cost less, only three Power for seven

**[23:36]** combat, which is crazy. However the theme with these other ancient Spellbooks, if

**[23:41]** you take extinction it makes it possible to permanently lose your Jothans, but in

**[23:46]** exchange you get this insane rate of three cost seven combat. If you can keep

**[23:51]** your Jothans safe with a entourage of other ancients units, they are really

**[23:56]** some of the scariest combat units in the entire game. If you manage to get all

**[24:01]** three of them together, that's 21 combat dice. If you add in the reanimated, that's

**[24:06]** 27 total combat. That's competing with the most dice that you can like possibly

**[24:11]** roll. Maybe alongside Cthulhu and Windwalker are the only other factions

**[24:15]** that can even get up to that amount of dice. We'll talk more about this, but yeah

**[24:21]** don't lose your Jothans unnecessarily, but they are a resource so consider over

**[24:27]** the course of the game you do want to make sure you're using them up to their

**[24:31]** maximum potential. Okay let's move on to the ancients Spellbooks. So I'm going to

**[24:39]** break this one up again too, and I'm going to talk about all of the cathedral

**[24:44]** centric Spellbooks first, and then I'll recap the monster Spellbooks. First

**[24:50]** Spellbook, Worship Services. During the gather Power phase, gain one Power for

**[24:55]** each cathedral that shares an area with an enemy Gate. Those enemies each gain

**[24:59]** one Power. So here's more social engineering for the ancients. Obviously

**[25:04]** players like Power. Players are going to really enjoy getting extra Power from

**[25:08]** this. Good players who've played against the ancients enough though know that a

**[25:12]** cathedral in their area might not always be a gift. It could eventually be a curse

**[25:18]** for reasons we will get into in a minute. If you manage to have three or four of

**[25:24]** these on the map and they're controlled by enemies, you're getting like you know

**[25:28]** two or three or four extra Power. That's a lot. That is paying for a significant

**[25:32]** chunk of a ritual, which this faction will like to do. Nice segue into the next

**[25:40]** Spellbook here, which is Consecration. In the doom phase, when you perform a ritual

**[25:45]** of annihilation, gain one Elder Sign if at least one cathedral is in play. If all

**[25:51]** four of your cathedrals are in play, gain two Elder Signs instead. You might have

**[25:56]** been wondering at the beginning if you don't have a great on one, how does this

**[25:59]** faction gain Elder Signs? This is how. It can be tempting to not want to ritual

**[26:05]** until you have all four of your cathedrals out so that you can get those

**[26:09]** full two Elder Signs, but just note that anywhere between one and three cathedrals

**[26:14]** you're still getting one Elder Sign, which is not nothing. Two Gates and one

**[26:19]** cathedral with consecration and a ritual, that's still five doom minimum.

**[26:23]** Especially nice if you've got some other cathedrals in your opponent's Gated

**[26:28]** areas and you're helping to subsidize the cost with worship services. Coming

**[26:36]** back around to cathedrals at enemy Gates and protecting your own Gates, we've got

**[26:41]** our last cathedral-centric Spellbook, Unholy Ground. This is a post-battle. If

**[26:46]** there's a cathedral in the battle area, you may choose to remove a cathedral

**[26:50]** from anywhere, so not just the battle area. If you do, an enemy great old one in

**[26:55]** the battle must be eliminated by its owner. So this is a very scary book, one

**[27:01]** of the most important tools in your belt as the ancients, so you need to be able

**[27:06]** to use this one effectively, or at least threaten to use it effectively against

**[27:09]** people. You only need to declare battle or have it declared against you in order

**[27:15]** to auto-kill a great old one after the battle, regardless of the combat results.

**[27:20]** If somebody fights you and you have only a reanimate there and you roll two

**[27:24]** combat die and they're both blanks, doesn't matter. If you have a cathedral

**[27:28]** in the area, you can eliminate a cathedral from there or anywhere else

**[27:32]** and you're sniping that great old one. We'll talk more about this in openings

**[27:37]** and playing the ancients, but because this book dematerialized, the unique

**[27:42]** faction ability can be extremely dangerous for your enemies, even as early

**[27:47]** as the first doom phase. If you dematerialize into an opponent's area in

**[27:53]** the first doom phase and they take a turn off awakening into that area with

**[27:59]** their great old one, they probably fucked up. If you take on holy ground and you

**[28:04]** battle them, you've just sniped their great old one, so PSA to everyone not

**[28:09]** playing the ancients, don't ever do this. You're gonna be really sad if you do, and

**[28:13]** the ancients player is at all paying attention. We'll talk a bit more about those

**[28:18]** books later in openings and playing this faction. Moving back to our second

**[28:26]** category of spell books that have to do with monsters, we've got our first one,

**[28:30]** Festival. Ongoing, unmin now causes zero Power to summon. When you summon an unmin,

**[28:36]** you also select an enemy player to gain one Power, and this is not optional. More

**[28:42]** social engineering here, my advice would be find a helpful companion, friend, or

**[28:48]** puppet to feed the Power to. Get them to do stuff for you in exchange for getting

**[28:52]** that Power. If you listen to my Power of friendship episode, threat assessment

**[28:59]** episode, you'll know that just

**[29:02]** Using your words can be very Powerful in Cthulhu Wars, so here you're using your words, you're

**[29:07]** also giving away some Power to sweeten the deal.

**[29:10]** You can really get up to some shenanigans with this if you are talking to the right

**[29:13]** person and getting them to do what you want.

**[29:18]** What you really want to set up if you can with this Spellbook taken is try to engineer

**[29:23]** some situations where you can throw some unmet under the bus with kills so that you can repeatedly

**[29:29]** take zero cost actions to summon them again, hopefully funneling even more Power into somebody

**[29:36]** who's agreed not to mess with you, maybe they agreed to do your bidding, something like

**[29:41]** that.

**[29:43]** I would not give away my festival Power randomly, you're a coward if you do that, but I also

**[29:49]** think you're leaving some value on the table if you do that.

**[29:52]** You really want to pick somebody and be talking to them the whole time, be cooperating with

**[29:57]** them the whole time if you can.

**[30:01]** Next book, Brainless, about reanimated, ongoing.

**[30:05]** Reanimated costs only one Power to summon.

**[30:07]** They may only move, capture, or declare battle if they share an area with one or more of

**[30:12]** your non-reanimated units.

**[30:14]** This is not optional.

**[30:18]** Like I said before, this feels bad, but one cost to combat is still a pretty nice rate.

**[30:24]** Reanimated are a great accompaniment to Cultist into an enemy Gated area where you want to

**[30:30]** either build a cathedral and or fight and kill a great old one with unholy ground.

**[30:38]** Don't get caught out by this drawback.

**[30:40]** Remember if you have a reanimated by itself, it's as good as dead, so make sure you keep

**[30:46]** your reanimated together with somebody else.

**[30:48]** Use the buddy system so that these units can actually do what they're supposed to do, which

**[30:53]** is fight mainly.

**[30:54]** You get three of these in the pool.

**[30:56]** That's potentially six combat dice pretty early on if you want it.

**[31:01]** As early as action phase two, reanimated can be dematerialized around the map to fight

**[31:06]** somewhere else.

**[31:07]** More on that a little bit later.

**[31:12]** Last Spellbook, Extinction.

**[31:14]** It's ongoing.

**[31:15]** Yothins now cost only three Power to summon.

**[31:18]** When a Yothin is killed or eliminated, remove it from the game permanently.

**[31:21]** This is not optional.

**[31:24]** Like I said before, Yothins are a resource, right?

**[31:28]** You get three of them.

**[31:29]** That's 21 combat dice, very impressive.

**[31:31]** But at the end of the game, if you have all three of your Yothins, did you really try

**[31:35]** hard enough to fight around the world or didn't you?

**[31:39]** If you have, you know, one or zero Yothins at the end of the game and you win or you're

**[31:44]** in second place, I think you did a great job.

**[31:46]** You used up your resource, set out there for you.

**[31:52]** And Yothins are just fucking cool.

**[31:53]** Let's just put that out there too.

**[31:54]** They're terrors.

**[31:55]** They fight great old ones pretty effectively because they just don't cost anything and

**[31:59]** they can punch super hard.

**[32:02]** Okay, we got the Spellbooks out of the way, the units out of the way, so we can move on

**[32:09]** to openings for the ancients and playing the ancients.

**[32:14]** On the openings, I think there's two main approaches to this faction, which you can

**[32:19]** flex between, of course, and you probably should be.

**[32:22]** There is this more typical opening of trying to spend your Power on rituals every turn,

**[32:28]** like some of the other engine factions out there.

**[32:31]** If you want to do this, I would be definitely moving, definitely building a Gate in the

**[32:37]** first action phase, and then probably building at least one cathedral, taking consecration

**[32:43]** so that you can ritual in the first doom phase and start accumulating those Elder Signs early

**[32:48]** and often.

**[32:51]** The second approach is more of this like fighting around the world concept where you're bullying

**[32:56]** factions off your Gates with your very cheap units that happen to have very high combat

**[33:02]** dice.

**[33:04]** If you're going for this approach, you're going to be using your Yothins and or your

**[33:09]** reanimated in combination with dematerialization and holy ground to get into position on someone

**[33:16]** else's Gate and either snipe their great old one or push them away and keep the Gate

**[33:22]** for yourself.

**[33:24]** Remember in Cthulhu Wars, especially action phase 2, a lot of players are going to be

**[33:28]** taking the turn off to awaken, and that's great for you as the ancients because your

**[33:33]** units are all very cheap and you have a lot of shenanigans that you can get up to, especially

**[33:39]** with dematerialization.

**[33:40]** You have a lot of opportunity to like push people off of Gates and not have to build

**[33:44]** them yourself.

**[33:47]** So there's like a lot of combinations with how to spend your Power in the first action

**[33:51]** phase if you're going to be fighting a lot.

**[33:54]** If you move and build a second Gate, you'll only have 4 Power to play with and you can

**[33:58]** use that either to maybe take brainless and summon all of your reanimated or take extinction

**[34:04]** and summon a single Yothin.

**[34:07]** Or if you want to opt out of building a second Gate altogether, you can go super hard and

**[34:12]** start doing this.

**[34:14]** I've heard it called colloquially Yothin bombing.

**[34:17]** If you don't build a second Gate, you can take extinction very early and summon multiple

**[34:22]** Yothins, two to be exact, and you can teleport those around with dematerialization in the

**[34:28]** first doom phase and start bullying people right away.

**[34:34]** Like I was saying earlier, if your enemies after the first doom phase and you've dematerialized

**[34:39]** into their area, if they're foolish enough to build a great old one there, they fucked

**[34:43]** up, you can build a cathedral and really punish them with unholy ground.

**[34:48]** If they're out of Power after that, their great old one is as good as dead.

**[34:52]** If they're not out of Power after that and their great old one sticks around and you've

**[34:55]** got a cathedral there, also they fucked up.

**[34:57]** They should definitely leave.

**[35:00]** Any expensive, 10 cost great old one like Narlathotep really really fears unholy ground

**[35:06]** and probably is going to stay away from your Gates as a result.

**[35:12]** Remember when you're going to try to bully people?

**[35:14]** All you need is one reanimated to do this with unholy ground.

**[35:19]** If you have one reanimated, you dematerialize, bring a friend, bring a couple acolytes with

**[35:23]** you, build a cathedral, and then you have the ability to declare combat if they don't

**[35:28]** fight you first.

**[35:32]** With this more fighty approach, you're going to be spending a lot of your Power moving

**[35:36]** and battling.

**[35:37]** Not unusual with this faction to spend multiple Power moving your units into position.

**[35:42]** You've got that crazy combat dice potential with the Jothins and you've also got your

**[35:48]** like really fast Spellbook tempo is also something to be mindful of when talking about the openings

**[35:54]** or just playing this faction in general.

**[35:57]** You can get your unlimited combat going sooner than most other factions, maybe all other

**[36:02]** factions with the exception of Cho's.

**[36:06]** Take advantage of that.

**[36:08]** Once you have unlimited combat, you can do the dirty, dirty trick of build a cathedral

**[36:13]** as your normal action and then unlimited combat.

**[36:16]** Great old ones are not going to like it once you can do that, so remember that that's a

**[36:21]** thing that you can do.

**[36:22]** Remember that when you remove a cathedral from play for unholy ground, it can be from

**[36:27]** anywhere on the map, not just the place where the battle occurred.

**[36:35]** Regardless of which style of opening you're going for, remember you have two Spellbook

**[36:39]** requirements, the giving away the cheapest monster and the most expensive monster.

**[36:44]** Those are pretty much free, so there's a lot of flexibility in how you can open.

**[36:49]** I don't know if I have time to get into all the permutations of openings here, but just

**[36:53]** know you can take pretty much two or three Spellbooks for free and whatever those are

**[36:58]** is up to you and you can blend between these two styles because you've got such a freedom

**[37:03]** to take whatever Spellbooks you want, kind of whenever you want them.

**[37:11]** So as far as ending on the openings and sort of transitioning into playing the ancients,

**[37:17]** once you've kind of done your thing and gone through the first doom phase, pretty much

**[37:20]** what you want to do the rest of the game is get the rest of your Spellbooks met.

**[37:26]** So you probably have two or maybe three.

**[37:29]** You don't need to rush, but you might want to be the first one to get Unlimited Combat.

**[37:34]** After you have Unlimited Combat, I would be trying to shoot for ending the action phase

**[37:38]** on at least two Gates, and hopefully you've got at least one cathedral out.

**[37:43]** That should enable you, hopefully, to be able to do a ritual every turn from then on, and

**[37:49]** you'll have at least five doom because you'll get two doom from your Gates, two doom from

**[37:53]** a ritual, at least one doom from consecration.

**[38:02]** So we're getting out of the openings and now we're sort of transitioning into playing the

**[38:06]** ancients.

**[38:07]** I mentioned this earlier, one tip, just protect your Cultists from capture if you can because

**[38:12]** Power can be tight with this faction.

**[38:14]** You don't want to limit your Gate potential.

**[38:16]** You don't want to limit your potential Power, if at all possible.

**[38:21]** On your monster Spellbooks, it might sound counterintuitive because of the drawbacks,

**[38:26]** but you really do want to get these to enhance your monsters.

**[38:29]** There's strings attached, of course, but being cheaper in terms of Power is 100% the better

**[38:34]** call overall.

**[38:35]** It could be tempting to get a 6-cost Jothun that you can resummon later.

**[38:42]** It's not worth a try.

**[38:43]** me. Just get extinction like you're supposed to, get them for three Power, save your Power,

**[38:47]** it's better spent moving and battling and causing trouble instead.

**[38:55]** I don't have a ton of advice playing Ancients. I'm not the best Ancients player in the world,

**[38:59]** so hopefully this guide is still useful to some. The main thing I'd call out is Unholy Ground is

**[39:05]** very flexible and Powerful. Remember that you can remove your cathedrals from anywhere when you

**[39:11]** trigger Unholy Ground, if there's a cathedral in the battle area. Blend these two styles together,

**[39:18]** the social engineering style and the fighty style. If someone's no longer being your friend and you

**[39:23]** had a cathedral in the area, take it away with Unholy Ground once you've killed a great old

**[39:28]** one elsewhere. They don't deserve it if they're not working for you anymore.

**[39:34]** You've got this really high combat potential as Ancients, so you do want to like assemble at some

**[39:40]** point maybe multiple Jothans and your Reanimated and your Unmen in a big ball. You can dematerialize

**[39:47]** around the map and hopefully get into a big fight with somebody else that has a lot of units,

**[39:52]** hopefully has some great old ones that you can kill. Some of the best companions to your Reanimated

**[40:00]** but also your Jothans are obviously those Unmen. If you can manage to get them killed, and hopefully

**[40:05]** you can because you're going to be battling often, if you can get them killed they're going to be so

**[40:10]** cheap to resummon and you'll be stalling the other players with zero cost actions

**[40:15]** while hopefully feeding somebody who is like cooperating with you.

**[40:21]** Be careful with your Jothans once you have extinction. Don't leave them by themselves,

**[40:26]** you really don't want them getting killed early on unnecessarily. You want to be the one to decide

**[40:32]** when your Jothans get killed and you really want to be taking out somebody important with you

**[40:36]** like another great old one. If at all possible, take them around with some Unmen or Reanimated

**[40:43]** and get those killed instead, or Cult of Steven. Anything else is preferable to getting a Jothan

**[40:49]** killed first thing. Another hot tip on playing the Ancients I mentioned a bit earlier, but

**[40:57]** figure out who the first player is going to be and start talking to them before they are the

**[41:02]** first player and the turn order is decided. Why do I say that? Especially once unlimited combat

**[41:08]** becomes a thing for this faction or multiple factions, you really want to be getting the

**[41:14]** turn order going in like an advantageous direction for you so that you can get off the battle first

**[41:21]** in order to maybe snipe that great old one or so that you can push people away

**[41:26]** and they can't capture you before you have a chance to take an action.

**[41:32]** Once this faction has unlimited combat they are extremely dangerous and I would say this

**[41:38]** faction more than others really really likes that train of pain. So what I mean by that is

**[41:44]** declaring unlimited combat against somebody, strategically panning yourself into another

**[41:49]** area with another opponent, and then fighting them right away before they have time to react.

**[41:55]** If you have your full death ball of two or three Jothans and a couple of friends, that's a lot of

**[42:01]** dice. So if you get paned out even with two Jothans and you know random unmen or something,

**[42:07]** you still have 14 Power to punch somebody super hard. So if there's not madness in the game,

**[42:14]** that's definitely what I'd recommend doing. You can really bully people and even like

**[42:18]** suppress the other factions if you are able to get off a couple of good battles

**[42:23]** and kill a couple of great old ones. You're going to be in a really great spot if you do that.

**[42:30]** I'd say this faction is the most dangerous once you have unlimited combat and approximately

**[42:35]** three cathedrals on the map. I say that because the dangerous thing that you can do is once you

**[42:40]** have unlimited combat build a cathedral and then fight right away. That will like allow you to

**[42:45]** snipe great old ones that are in your area. I think that's mostly what I have to say on

**[42:53]** playing the Ancients. Like I said, I think you'll be most successful if you are using your words,

**[43:00]** using that social engineering, in combination with the raw combat bullying potential. You can

**[43:05]** use some social engineering there too. Threaten people with your high combat value. You may not

**[43:12]** actually need to carry out the threat. You can still get them to do what you want just by saying

**[43:16]** that you're going to hurt them. That's all for playing Ancients. I think we can move on to some

**[43:23]** advice for thwarting the Ancients. First thing, similar advice to Demon Sultan, just don't make

**[43:30]** deals with these fuckers. They are up to no good and they don't want nice things for you ultimately.

**[43:36]** They're out to win the game. They're not out to like be your friend the entire game. Maybe

**[43:41]** don't make deals with them. Maybe break the deal. Maybe keep your honor, but like take advantage of

**[43:47]** anything they didn't say when they're trying to draw up a social contract with you. If they say

**[43:52]** like, hey go do this for me, but they also don't say like, and don't mess with my Gates, like go

**[43:57]** go mess with their Gates. Just do it. They didn't say not to, so getting them with that rules lawyer

**[44:03]** stuff can be nice. They'll be upset with you, but you know that's on them. You gotta read the fine

**[44:08]** print. You gotta also write up the fine print so people actually need to read it.

**[44:13]** Second piece of advice, if possible, don't make it easy for them to build cathedrals.

**[44:18]** If you let an Ancients acolyte come into your area and you don't capture them or battle them

**[44:23]** and they get to build a cathedral, cool. Maybe you've got some angle where you want the Power

**[44:29]** so that you can do a ritual or something, but you probably gave them a Spellbook by doing that, so

**[44:34]** just know that you did that for them. If you want to be mean to them and capture battle them away,

**[44:40]** especially if they use dematerialization to get into an area with a certain glyph,

**[44:44]** that sucks for them. If you capture them, they will need to get back into an area with that

**[44:49]** glyph somehow. Try to spot where they haven't built cathedrals. Maybe you can be there,

**[44:55]** maybe you can battle them, maybe you can capture them before they can actually get their Spellbooks.

**[45:00]** They earn them so quickly, so the way to actually get in their way is by stopping them from building

**[45:05]** the cathedrals. If you can force them to have to build a cathedral adjacent to another one for

**[45:11]** three Power instead of one, that's great, because like I said, every Power can matter for this

**[45:16]** faction, so anything you can do to starve them of some Power or make them spend some extra is worth

**[45:22]** doing. If ancients start giving you Power with the unmen, you can just start using that against

**[45:30]** them. Start to use your own social engineering against them. If they become the leader,

**[45:35]** start telling the other players not to cooperate with them. They're going to want to give away

**[45:41]** that unmen Power to other players. If everybody's kind of like aligned against them, it's starting

**[45:46]** to feel bad for the ancients player. They're taking zero cost actions, yes, but they have to

**[45:50]** give away Power to people who are like clearly their enemies in the moment, and they really don't

**[45:55]** want to do that. Last piece of advice, it's obvious, but just keep the ancients player off of as many

**[46:03]** Gates as possible. The maximum amount of Gates you ever want the ancients to be on is two.

**[46:08]** Any higher than that, they're probably going to win with the Elder Signs that they get.

**[46:13]** One Gate is preferable. If you can never make it so that the ancients can't afford a ritual,

**[46:18]** amazing. You've done a great job.

**[46:23]** And I think that's all that I have for the ancients guide.

**[46:27]** My closing thoughts, it's a very strange faction. I wouldn't recommend this one to people for their

**[46:33]** first game, but having said that, I do know several people who played Cthulhu Wars with

**[46:39]** me for the first time. They insisted on playing the ancients, and they did really well, so I can't

**[46:45]** fault them for it. I like the big scary monsters, great old ones, so I kind of like gravitate away

**[46:52]** from these ones, but don't get me wrong, I love fighting around the world, so I will take that

**[46:57]** opportunity when it comes up. I definitely favor that fightier approach as opposed to the more

**[47:02]** typical passive approach where you're doing a lot of rituals. I prefer just like punching people in

**[47:08]** the face and taking their stuff away from them. So if you enjoy a good battle, this faction could

**[47:14]** be for you. If you enjoy manipulating people, I do. This faction could also be for you.

**[47:21]** I'm definitely not an ancients specialist, so hopefully you still found this guide useful.

**[47:27]** If I missed something big in terms of strategy, definitely let me know.

**[47:32]** And I think that's another episode in the book, so thank you very much for listening.
