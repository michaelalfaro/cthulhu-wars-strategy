## Transcript

**[00:00]** As time wore along, his absorption in the irregular wall and ceiling of his room increased,

**[00:07]** for he began to read into the odd angles a mathematical significance which seemed to offer

**[00:12]** vague clues regarding their purpose. Old Keziah, he reflected, might have had excellent reasons for

**[00:19]** living in a room with peculiar angles, for was it not through certain angles that she claimed to

**[00:24]** have gone outside the boundaries of the world of space we know?

**[00:30]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:49]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host. Hope you're doing well wherever you are. I'm recording

**[00:56]** this in mid-January on a very cold and dark morning. Kind of good conditions for podcasting,

**[01:06]** to be honest. Staying warm and definitely staying dry. I said in another episode I would give you an

**[01:13]** update on how it was going with the Three Births of Daloth trilogy by Ramsey Campbell. I have finished

**[01:19]** it. I thought it was really, really good. Do recommend, if you at all like Cosmic Horror,

**[01:25]** really, really thought it was awesome and a great read. Particularly if you're like me,

**[01:31]** and you get a lot out of these short stories, and you're getting pretty jazzed about this whole theme,

**[01:35]** imagine that's split into three novels. It's about, I don't know, 900 pages in total, something like

**[01:40]** that, and from somebody that really knows how to write their way through a book or three. So,

**[01:47]** definitely check that out. What are we going to be talking about in this episode? I'm both happy to

**[01:54]** say, and maybe a little sad to say, depending on your perspective, this is actually going to be the

**[01:59]** last episode I record. Maybe not ever, but for quite some time. Why is that? I've covered the mission

**[02:09]** statement of the podcast at this point, I feel. I am filling in the rest of the neutral units I've not

**[02:16]** covered. The ones that sit alone by themselves, as opposed to being part of a set like the Dreamlands

**[02:22]** monsters, for example. I'm covering all of those here. Everything else, all the maps, all the faction

**[02:28]** guides, that has been spoken for in other episodes. So, consider this like a season one finale, and

**[02:37]** enjoy yourself. I'm not going out on like a 15 minute short episode. There's a lot to cover here, so

**[02:43]** this one probably is going to be pretty jumbo sized in the end, and yeah. Hope you enjoy as we work

**[02:49]** through the rest of the neutral units that we have out here. I'll get going and start with our first

**[02:56]** neutral monster. Suddenly, a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us, and we flashed on the second torch.

**[03:05]** It's odd how wholly this new quest had turned our minds from earlier fears of what might lurk near.

**[03:10]** These other ones, having left their supplies in the great circular place, must have planned to return

**[03:16]** after their scouting trip toward or into the abyss, yet we had now discarded all caution concerning them

**[03:21]** as completely as if they had ever existed. This white waddling thing was fully six feet high,

**[03:28]** yet we seemed to realize at once that it was not one of those others. They were larger and dark,

**[03:33]** and according to the sculptures, their motion over land surfaces was a swift, assured matter despite the

**[03:38]** queerness of their sea-borne tentacle equipment. But to say the white thing did not profoundly frighten

**[03:44]** us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an instant by a primitive dread almost sharper than

**[03:50]** the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others. Then came a flash of anti-climax as the white

**[03:56]** shape sidled into a lateral archway to our left to join two others of its kind, which had summoned it in

**[04:02]** raucous tones, or it was only a penguin, albeit of a huge unknown species larger than the greatest of

**[04:09]** the known king penguins and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual eyelessness.

**[04:16]** Okay, our first neutral unit to discuss today is going to be a neutral monster. We've got the

**[04:22]** giant albino penguins. Sculpted by Tara Stranek, very awesome looking, really disgusting monster

**[04:31]** penguin. It's got almost like a turtle shell looking thing. It's got an incredibly long tongue. Think like

**[04:38]** Windwalker's tongue. This might even have Ithaca beat for the longest tongue in the entire game.

**[04:43]** Tongue wrapping around in a really crazy angle. And yeah, they have like big, nasty, bony fingers.

**[04:49]** They're flightless birds, but yeah, these ones look like they could claw you up and they look kind of mean

**[04:56]** even though they're supposedly very harmless.

**[05:00]** These are from the story At the Mountains of Madness by H.P. Lovecraft, one of his longer tales.

**[05:06]** Definitely check it out if you have a chance. A lot of nice world building going on in there.

**[05:11]** The giant penguins are just sort of a like detour on the way to like the actual scary stuff that happens

**[05:18]** in that story. I like them. One place I really don't like these is Arkham Horror, the card game.

**[05:24]** They are my nemesis. If you've played the Edge of the Earth campaign, you probably know what I'm

**[05:29]** talking about. But anyway, we're talking about Cthulhu Wars. How do we obtain the giant albino

**[05:35]** penguins? You're going to pay two doom to obtain their loyalty card, and then you're going to place a

**[05:40]** penguin at your controlled Gate. Penguins have a cost of one, and they have a combat of negative two,

**[05:46]** which we've never seen on a Cthulhu Wars unit before. And the ability on giant blind albino

**[05:54]** penguins is laughingstock pre-battle ability. Move one or more penguins to the battle area,

**[06:02]** even if you're not part of the battle. If you are part of the battle, the penguin fights on your side.

**[06:07]** Otherwise, you choose which side the penguin is on, and it belongs to that player until the battle's end.

**[06:12]** So this is a pretty hilarious ability, if you ask me. These are kind of like the anti-Ghouls,

**[06:20]** if you will, since they're going to subtract two dice, at least, from the battle results. Even a

**[06:25]** single penguin subtracting two dice is kind of a big deal. What can you do with these? I think you

**[06:31]** could really, like, make people spend Power on some prolonged, like, multi-action conflicts over one

**[06:38]** area, since there's just naturally going to be less dice rolled with the penguins in the mix,

**[06:43]** and therefore, like, less pains and kills being rolled. Do note that the penguins belong to the

**[06:50]** person that you give them to on their side of the battle, so they can, as opposed to the Ghouls,

**[06:56]** which come in post-battle, these come in pre-battle. The opponent has the penguin on their side. If they

**[07:01]** get a kill rolled against them, they can put it on the penguin. Keep that in mind, but the good news is

**[07:06]** that the penguins are extremely cheap to summon as well at only one Power. This is a pretty strange

**[07:12]** unit. Also note that it does not really benefit you in your battles if you bring it into a battle

**[07:18]** that you're participating in. The penguins are always on your side, so you'll be rolling a lot less dice,

**[07:23]** though maybe you just want the one-cost body in the battle to absorb a kill away from your other

**[07:29]** more valuable units that are there. So I also think there's, like, a nice diplomacy angle here, too,

**[07:36]** because you can use it in other battles. You can probably be table-talking a little bit,

**[07:40]** threatening to use this to ruin somebody's battle, or threatening to help somebody who you already have

**[07:46]** an alliance with. So I think there's a lot of play to this one. I haven't gotten on the table yet

**[07:50]** myself, but I look forward to it because it's just silly and also seems pretty Powerful, honestly.

**[07:57]** What factions like this? The first one that comes to mind is My Love, Black Goat. I think this is,

**[08:02]** like, an S tier neutral for this faction. I say that for the same reason as the Ghouls. It's going

**[08:08]** to let you, like, quote-unquote move into extra areas with multiple opponents. That's another Spellbook

**[08:14]** requirement you have for free. Hopefully these don't get a kill rolled against them, and that way they'd

**[08:19]** be out of the area, but I think this is going to make it pretty easy for you to, like, earn those

**[08:23]** multiple area books. Probably also sharing all areas with your opponent's book seems very easy if you

**[08:28]** have the penguins on top of also having the Ghouls. Yellow Sign might like this too, for themselves,

**[08:36]** I mean, putting it into their own battles. They're not really rolling that many dice to begin with,

**[08:40]** and it is a body that you can put in the way to make sure that your valuable units,

**[08:46]** Hastur, and more importantly King and Yellow, like, don't get killed.

**[08:51]** I'll also shout out maybe Demon Sultan as a faction that wants this to participate in battle on their side

**[08:58]** of the field, because they might have an avatar thesis or an antithesis, which might already be

**[09:04]** rolling zero dice or one or zero dice. In that sense, the penguins are not really going to hurt

**[09:08]** you at all, so I think that's a good shout out there. Hard to make a blanket statement here on

**[09:15]** whether this benefits the fighty factions or the defensive factions, mostly because when you bring

**[09:19]** it into the battle on your side, it's always going to not benefit you. So it's probably, like,

**[09:24]** at the end of the day, a social engineering unit that you can use in other people's battles to

**[09:30]** cause a lot of mischief. So if you have any good albino penguin stories, definitely let me know.

**[09:37]** And with that, we'll move on to our next unit, our first terror of this episode.

**[09:44]** The more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various cosmic enemies.

**[09:49]** They'd done the same thing on other planets, having manufactured not only necessary foods,

**[09:55]** but certain multicellular protoplasmic masses capable of molding their tissues into all sorts

**[10:00]** of temporary organs under hypnotic influence, and thereby forming ideal slaves to perform

**[10:05]** the heavy work of the community. These viscous masses were no doubt what

**[10:10]** Abdul Alhazred whispered about as the Shoggoths in his frightful Necronomicon,

**[10:14]** though even that mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on Earth, except in the dreams of those

**[10:20]** who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb. When the star-headed old ones on this planet had

**[10:25]** synthesized their simple food forms and bred a good supply of Shoggoths, they allowed other cell

**[10:30]** groups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable life for sundry purposes, extirpating

**[10:36]** any whose presence became troublesome.

**[10:38]** And yes, our next scene that we have to discuss is the Elder Shoggoth. I'm not sure who it was that

**[10:48]** sculpted this one, but really good job. Love the way this looks. There was another quote from

**[10:54]** the Mountains of Madness there. This is kind of like one of the titular scary things that are in that

**[11:01]** story, and yeah, it looks very much like a mass of tentacles. It's got like a head, many different eyes,

**[11:08]** if you've seen the Cthulhu Shoggoths, you know they got a lot of eyes. And a big mouth, yeah, I kind of

**[11:13]** like how it looks like it's maybe crawling a little bit, but it's got a bunch of tentacles, like it looks

**[11:17]** like it's used to swimming, but exploring on land maybe. This is our first terror, so to get the Elder

**[11:24]** Shoggoth, you're gonna pay two doom and two Power to take its loyalty card, and then you're gonna place

**[11:29]** the Elder Shoggoth at your controlled Gate. Shoggoth costs four to summon and has a combat of two.

**[11:38]** The ability on the Shoggoth is prime cause, it's a pre-battle. In a battle involving the Elder

**[11:46]** Shoggoth, choose any of your units, including this one, and replace it with any other unit from your

**[11:51]** pool. You can gain a faction Great Old One that was previously awakened, but must still fulfill other

**[11:57]** requirements. For example, to place Cthulhu, the battle must be in the South Pacific area, and there

**[12:05]** needs to be a Gate there. If you choose to replace the Elder Shoggoth itself, pay nothing, and no enemy

**[12:11]** gains a reward. Otherwise, follow these rules. First, you'll pay half the new unit's Power cost

**[12:17]** rounded down, so you would pay one Power for a three-cost monster. If the new unit is a terror,

**[12:23]** the enemy you're battling gains one doom. If the new unit is a Great Old One, the enemy that you're

**[12:28]** battling gains one Elder Sign. Very, very spicy unit. You can target any of your units in the area

**[12:36]** with the Shoggoth before the dice get rolled, including the Shoggoth itself, and it can kind

**[12:41]** of hatch into any unit in your pool, all the way from your Acolytes to your faction Great Old Ones.

**[12:50]** You'll still need to fulfill other awakening requirements like those rules mentioned,

**[12:54]** but I don't really think that's a very big ask for such a strong effect.

**[13:00]** So, let me talk about this in two different ways. So first, let's talk about if you target

**[13:06]** the Elder Shoggoth itself. That doesn't require you to give anything away to anybody or pay any Power.

**[13:14]** When you first get the Shoggoth, you pay two Power and two doom, so effectively, you've paid that much

**[13:21]** if you want to swap out for one of your Great Old Ones. Or four Power if you've summoned the Shoggoth

**[13:27]** again and you're using Prime Cause for like a second or third time, if that makes sense.

**[13:32]** How about targeting anything other than the Elder Shoggoth? So let's say like we want to replace

**[13:38]** one of our Acolytes and we want to, I don't know, still summon a Great Old One. You still need to pay

**[13:45]** half the Power. Half price is not cheap for some Great Old Ones. Maybe like a Narlapotep would still

**[13:51]** cost you five, but still a pretty good deal if you just give up an Acolyte in exchange for five Power

**[13:57]** Great Old One. I really like that. You'll be giving away Doom for

**[14:01]** Terrors and an Elder Sign for a Great Old One, but I don't really think that's a huge deal,

**[14:08]** except maybe toward the end of the game. Note that there's no room for diplomacy here. This is

**[14:13]** the person fighting you that you are donating Doom or Elder Signs to, so keep that in mind.

**[14:20]** What factions like this? Again, I think I already maybe have mentioned them. All the ones that have

**[14:25]** like an expensive Great Old One that cost maybe eight or ten, Crawling Chaos, Black Goat, Demon

**[14:31]** Salton, Yellow Sign, Sleeper come to mind. Those all seem like they could make great use of the Elder

**[14:37]** Shoggoth. If you've got any sweet Elder Shoggoth plays that you've done, let me know because I'm super

**[14:44]** interested in hearing about it. I think that's all I've got on Elder Shoggoth, so I'll move on to the

**[14:50]** next terror that we have to discuss. That object, no larger than a good-sized rat and quaintly called

**[14:58]** by the townspeople Brown Jenkin, seemed to have been the fruit of a remarkable case of sympathetic

**[15:03]** herd delusion, where in 1692 no less than 11 persons had testified to glimpsing it. There were

**[15:10]** recent rumors, too, with a baffling and disconcerting amount of agreement. Witnesses said it had long hair

**[15:16]** in the shape of a rat, but that its sharp-toothed bearded face was evilly human, while its paws were

**[15:21]** like tiny human hands. It took messages betwixt old Keziah and the devil, and was nursed on the

**[15:28]** witch's blood, which it sucked like a vampire. Oh, that's right, our next terror to discuss is Brown

**[15:35]** Jenkin, sculpted by Valerio Carbone. Brown Jenkin is from the story Dreams in the Witch House by H.P.

**[15:44]** Lovecraft. Pretty underrated short story, in my opinion. I actually think this is one of my favorite

**[15:49]** ones nowadays. Yeah, he's kind of the familiar of the witch Keziah Mason, who has somehow figured out

**[15:55]** how to travel outside of like the Euclidean space that we all know and love. So very cool story, a lot

**[16:03]** of implications on other stories. I think people have taken a lot of inspiration from this one in

**[16:08]** other stories and novels that have been written. To get Brown Jenkin, we're going to pay 2 Power and 2

**[16:17]** doom to obtain their loyalty card, and then place Brown Jenkin at our controlled Gate. The unit has a

**[16:24]** cost of 2 to summon and a combat of 0. It's got two abilities. First, Loathsome Titter, Gather Power

**[16:33]** phase. If Brown Jenkin shares an area with an enemy controlled Gate during the gather Power phase,

**[16:39]** gain 2 Power plus 1 more Power for each enemy Cultist in the area. And then we've also got

**[16:46]** another ongoing ability, Familiar. If Brown Jenkin is killed or eliminated, if or as soon as you have

**[16:53]** at least 2 Power, pay 2 Power and place Brown Jenkin at your controlled Gate. This does not count as an

**[17:00]** action, and this is not optional. Okay, let's talk about Loathsome Titter first. So sneaking into

**[17:08]** anyone's area, last thing in the action phase. So let's say they have just a Gate with one Cultist on

**[17:14]** it. You're gaining 3 additional Power just for that. That's really nice. But now imagine that we snuck

**[17:21]** onto their like starting Gate, and maybe there's a controlled Gate, and there's 4 other Cultists in the

**[17:27]** area. That is insane. That is like 7 additional Power. So like 3 from the Gate, and then the 4 other

**[17:34]** Cultists. That's insane. That is probably most of, if not the entirety of a ritual. That's free. So

**[17:41]** that's really, really good. Now onto the drawback. That's the Familiar ability. Quote unquote drawback.

**[17:49]** So Familiar is ensuring Brown Jenkin never dies, but he doesn't ask to be brought back. He is going to

**[17:56]** come back no matter what, and he steals from you whenever he does to Power. So try to avoid letting

**[18:02]** him die too many times, but you probably paid for at least one or two deaths every time you use

**[18:08]** Loathsome Titter. So that's something to keep in mind. The other thing to remember is you're not

**[18:13]** going to like sneak around Familiar by having Brown Jenkin get killed when you have zero Power. It also

**[18:19]** says as soon as you have the Power to pay, Brown Jenkin is coming back. So if it has to happen in

**[18:24]** gather Power phase, once you have that two Power, he's coming back onto your Gates.

**[18:31]** Having said all that, I think if you can keep this unit like reasonably safe, it doesn't even matter

**[18:36]** if it dies one time. You're just looking for those like heavily populated Gates, and if you can find one,

**[18:41]** this is going to just be a huge boon to your faction. Maybe you can even find an area where there's

**[18:46]** like all of the Cultists from one player, and then there's even more Cultists from another player there.

**[18:51]** So you can truly get some insane Power windfalls with this unit.

**[18:57]** What factions like this? Honestly, I think this is an amazing unit for basically everyone.

**[19:02]** The Familiar tax is so small compared to like the three Power return minimum that you're going to get

**[19:09]** from the Loathsome Titter. So if you can keep this unit safe, it's just going to be insanely good.

**[19:14]** I think this is probably great in a high player count game too, because there's going to be more

**[19:20]** Cultists around, but I'll leave that up to you. I haven't played this one myself, so I look forward

**[19:24]** to seeing this one too. I think this is an amazing neutral to include in any game, because it's going

**[19:31]** to be sought after, and I can see right away it's passing that test that I have for most neutral units,

**[19:37]** especially terrors, of like, is this going to get me back the two Power and two doom I spent on it?

**[19:43]** Absolutely. If you can earn seven Power with this in ritual, it's paid for itself right there.

**[19:51]** That's enough on Brown Jenkins, so I'm going to move on to the first independent great old one we

**[19:56]** have to discuss. I'm going to start strong with a pretty spicy one. We've got Gobo Jeg. Gobo Gag?

**[20:05]** Not sure how you say this one, honestly. Sculpted by Joe Brumby is Gobo Jeg. I'm going to say Gobo Gag

**[20:12]** from here on out. Gobo Jeg? I have no idea how I'm going to say this one. Gobo Gag. Gobo Gag.

**[20:22]** Pretty cool looking. Sort of looks like, uh, I don't know, some alien snake-like thing coming out of

**[20:30]** the ground, maybe on a moon or something. If you've seen this one, you're probably thinking,

**[20:36]** I know, something else it looks like too. Yes, sure does look that way. So, um, Joe, I don't know what

**[20:43]** you were taking inspiration from, but there you go. Good job on this, I guess.

**[20:49]** How to awaken Gobo Gag. This is a pretty interesting one. At least one player needs to have six faction

**[20:55]** Spellbooks. You're going to need to have a controlled Gate in an area with your great old one,

**[21:00]** and you're going to pay zero Power and place Gobo Gag in the area containing your Gate.

**[21:07]** The combat for this great old one is zero dice, but if Gobo Gag is killed or pained,

**[21:13]** all units in the area are pained. This is regardless of faction.

**[21:18]** And then we have the ability for Gobo Gag is the book of law. It's ongoing. While Gobo Gag is in play,

**[21:25]** whenever a great old one is awakened, the owner receives six Power after the awakening.

**[21:30]** So among people that are knowledgeable about the Cthulhu Wars neutrals, I think this one gets

**[21:36]** the most shoutouts for being completely crazy and unbalanced. I've not played this one, but I can tell

**[21:44]** it's just going to make the game go completely off the rails. It doesn't even matter who buys this one,

**[21:50]** any player awakening, any great old one is going to receive six Power after the awakening. So just know

**[21:57]** that if you buy this, things are going to get crazy really, really fast. So we're getting a huge rebate

**[22:03]** on a lot of the expensive great old ones. The cheaper great old ones are maybe paying for themselves

**[22:08]** entirely, or maybe even getting a little bit of a rebate in Power, which is insane.

**[22:16]** I think the factions with multiple great old ones obviously are going to benefit the most from this,

**[22:21]** but in particular, like Demon Sultan seems absolutely ridiculous with this because you have three great

**[22:27]** old ones. Kind of makes the variable cost of your two thesis avatars totally insignificant because

**[22:34]** you're just going to get Power back for both. And yeah, it is wild. I've saved the Spellbook requirement

**[22:40]** for last because it only involves someone winning the game and it doesn't need to be the person who

**[22:46]** controls Gobogag. The Spellbook for Gobogag is Book of Chaos. It's a post-game ability. If the game ends

**[22:54]** while you control Gobogag, immediately place the Spellbook and gloat. Take notes, we got a gloat, okay?

**[23:01]** Then you get to pick the factions, expansions, map, neutral monsters, and independent great old ones

**[23:07]** to be used the next time your group plays Cthulhu Wars.

**[23:10]** So that's pretty insane if the Book of Law ability wasn't enough to make this great old one crazy. It

**[23:18]** has this Spellbook, this like fourth wall breaking Spellbook that can kind of pick and choose what

**[23:24]** people are going to play in the next game. No idea how to evaluate that, but I love what it does.

**[23:30]** Kind of recommend if you want to just like keep playing games with your group and your group's very

**[23:35]** comfortable playing on maps or with neutrals or with whatever factions. Maybe just have the Book of

**[23:41]** Chaos like out there for the winner of the game and have that player pick who's going to play what.

**[23:47]** Maybe that's the most balanced way to do this. I don't know. This is a crazy crazy great old one and

**[23:53]** it's really only going to get crazier from there. So strap in for the rest of the great old ones I have to

**[23:59]** discuss. Our next great old one is going to be Dyer Azathoth sculpted by Aeteras Stranek.

**[24:11]** This one's going to look very familiar to you if you've seen Demon Sultan because this is the exact

**[24:16]** same sculpt as Avatar Synthesis but it's gray and not the like chocolatey faction color for Demon Sultan.

**[24:23]** This is another really wild great old one so I'm going to get right into the notes here.

**[24:30]** In a game with Dyer Azathoth, Windwalker, Opener of the Way, Chocho, and the Ancients must place their

**[24:36]** glyph tokens in their start areas. There's a note right at the beginning here. Do not use Dyer Azathoth

**[24:42]** on Primeval Earth or Shigai maps. That's going to make a lot more sense very shortly.

**[24:47]** How to awaken Dyer Azathoth. You're going to need to control a Gate on an enemy faction start area so

**[24:55]** that is a bit unusual and you're going to need to pay 10 Power and place Dyer Azathoth into the area.

**[25:04]** Combat for this unit. You roll a die and Dyer Azathoth's combat rating is equal to the result of

**[25:09]** the roll. And I do believe this is a regular D6 combat as opposed to Demon Sultan Synthesis which

**[25:16]** can roll a D6 that is from like 3 to 8. I believe this is a D6.

**[25:22]** And the ability on this great old one is Mindless Destruction.

**[25:27]** It is a post-battle. Any faction battling in Dyer Azathoth's area gains their choice of one doom or one

**[25:34]** Power for every unit that faction kills or eliminates in that battle. Dyer Azathoth does not need to be

**[25:41]** involved in the battle.

**[25:44]** So right off the bat I think it's pretty unrealistic to even awaken this because controlling the Gate in

**[25:50]** the enemy start area is going to be pretty tricky but let's assume that you were able to do that for

**[25:55]** whatever reason. Sometimes that does happen. Sometimes people are just sitting on other player start

**[26:00]** areas and maybe it's not a big deal to get this out. So assuming you have a bunch of units in the

**[26:08]** area you awoke Dyer Azathoth in, the Mindless Destruction ability could be kind of nice if you're

**[26:13]** rolling a bunch of dice. You might be able to harvest a bunch of doom or Power. That's going to be really

**[26:18]** nice but this one doesn't roll a lot of combat on its own. Like a minimum of one and a maximum of six.

**[26:23]** Kind of yikes. But all that being said I think you might be playing this one for its

**[26:30]** Spellbook requirement and Spellbook here. The Spellbook requirement you must pay 20 Power which

**[26:36]** okay. There's factions that just straight up like can never do this mostly. And the Spellbook is the

**[26:43]** blind idiot god. It just says game over. Immediately win the game even if you don't have all six of your

**[26:50]** faction Spellbooks or the most doom. That Spellbook requirement is pretty restrictive. I think only a

**[26:57]** handful of factions can hope to do this. So Windwalker with Hibernate. Black Goat maybe only if you can

**[27:04]** like actually get nine Gates and maybe eight Gates with a capture. Yellow Sign with Feast perhaps. Or

**[27:11]** Chocho on several Gates and being able to like pop some high priest to get up to that amount.

**[27:17]** Otherwise it's going to be unattractive for like a good chunk of factions at the table.

**[27:21]** The more combat focused factions are going to be much more interested in that mindless destruction

**[27:28]** ability. And they're also going to be the ones that are like most likely to be able to knock somebody

**[27:33]** off of their starting Gate and claim it for themselves. So Kernie Wild Neutral. I've not played

**[27:38]** this one partly because I think the awakening requirement is way too strict to make it very

**[27:43]** attractive in a game with other neutrals. But if you've got any other interesting dire Azathoth stories

**[27:50]** definitely let me know. I am very interested.

**[27:55]** I'll move on to my next unit which is actually an elder god as opposed to an independent great old

**[28:03]** one. So think like Bastet or Haggard Rhiones. We have Nodans here sculpted by Valerio Carbone.

**[28:12]** Pretty gross looking. It's like a kind of a snail hooded, I don't know, it's like a snail figure

**[28:19]** with lots of legs and some arms and it's got a cool like almost technological arm looking thing.

**[28:26]** Look like it's about to shoot a laser out. Very scary looking but also pretty cool looking.

**[28:32]** Doesn't really have a face either which I like.

**[28:36]** How to awaken Nodans. You're going to need a controlled Gate in an area with your great old

**[28:41]** one and then you're going to pay six Power and place Nodans into the area.

**[28:45]** And since this is an elder god it cannot declare battles on its own but its combat,

**[28:52]** supposing it's in a battle, add one kill and two pains to your combat total.

**[28:58]** And the ability on Nodans is healing. At the end of the doom phase unless the Ritual of Annihilation

**[29:04]** track has reached sudden death, move the ritual marker backwards one step but not past the start.

**[29:10]** So that is a pretty insane ability right there. Some factions are really stoked on this. Chocho would

**[29:19]** love it if rituals just stayed the same or cost it a little bit cheaper every time.

**[29:26]** Depending on the player counts you might be kind of slowing down how fast the ritual is ticking up

**[29:31]** if that makes sense as opposed to making it cheaper but there you go. That's just a natural

**[29:35]** thing that's going to happen with like six player games. The Spellbook requirement here is perform a

**[29:41]** Ritual of Annihilation. Not difficult at all. You're probably interested in doing that if you bought this

**[29:45]** in the first place. And the Spellbook for Nodans is Proteus. It's a two cost action. Choose one of

**[29:53]** your earned faction Spellbooks that names either a type of unit or a specific unit. So like acolytes or

**[29:59]** flying polyps for example. Place your faction glyph on that Spellbook. Nodans then benefits from that

**[30:05]** Spellbook's effects as if it were a named unit or type of unit. Really cool ability is Proteus. It's a bit

**[30:13]** like ancient sorcery but only for one unit and you're copying Spellbooks instead of unique faction abilities.

**[30:20]** I don't have a full list of all the nice ones here but one that comes to mind I do like is like

**[30:26]** regeneration from Great Cthulhu. Nodans being able to like soak up a couple of kills before actually

**[30:32]** getting killed itself is pretty nice. How about Red Sign from Black Goat? Nodans can control Gates

**[30:38]** and provide Power. That's pretty cool. I do think this works with million favored ones since you can

**[30:44]** consider Nodans to be any of the units mentioned there. So it could be like Nodans is a spawn and

**[30:49]** Nodans can downgrade into mutants or upgrade into a spawn. Not sure why you'd want to do this but you

**[30:54]** could. How about seek and destroy bringing Nodans into the battle along with your hunting horrors.

**[31:00]** That's pretty cool too. Sure there's a bunch of other examples I'm not even considering.

**[31:07]** What factions like this Elder God? I would say probably the defensive factions, the doom-loving

**[31:15]** factions the most because of healing but I think any faction could make some pretty good use of Proteus

**[31:21]** if you're being sneaky about it. Tell me your best Nodans stories because I have not played with this

**[31:27]** one either and I need to see it because it's pretty rad. Let's move on to our next independent great old

**[31:36]** one. We have Dire Cthulhu sculpted by Tidal 4. I like this one. It's more of like a brawny Cthulhu.

**[31:45]** It's doing the same pose. He's like hanging out on a rock but if the original Cthulhu looks like lean

**[31:51]** and mean this one looks like it's been hitting the gym like every day and is bulked out and really

**[31:57]** ready to fight. How to awaken Dire Cthulhu. You're going to need a controlled Gate in an area with your

**[32:05]** great old one and then you're going to pay six Power and place Dire Cthulhu in the area containing

**[32:10]** the Gate. Also you're going to gain one Elder Sign and this unit has a flat combat of three.

**[32:18]** The ability on this unit is lord and master. It's ongoing. When you awaken an independent great old

**[32:24]** one except Dire Cthulhu gain an Elder Sign. So pretty simple not really useful except in games where

**[32:32]** you're already using independent great old ones. So keep that in mind. Spellbook requirement is kill

**[32:39]** three enemy units in a single battle. So kind of a nice homage to Great Cthulhu's two combat books but

**[32:46]** maybe a little tricky to earn this one since this unit itself only rolls three dice.

**[32:52]** In the Spellbook here we have non-euclidean post-battle. If Dire Cthulhu is involved in a battle

**[32:59]** you may assign any battle results you inflict to any faction with units in the area even if they did not

**[33:05]** participate in the battle. If the results are assigned to a non-participating faction that faction may not

**[33:11]** use battle abilities or Spellbooks in response. Affected factions still select which of their units

**[33:17]** receive the battle results. Pretty strange ability honestly. I could see this doing a lot of damage in

**[33:25]** contested areas in higher player count games for sure but otherwise I'm pretty unimpressed by this.

**[33:32]** It's sort of like a mid-cost independent great old one. I wish you got Elder Signs for any great old

**[33:37]** one not just the independents and then it would be a lot more attractive to like a yellow sign or a

**[33:43]** Windwalker or a demon sultan that kind of thing. As is save this one for your games that have a bunch

**[33:49]** of neutrals and I think it will be a lot better over there. Not too much else to say on this one

**[33:57]** so I will move on to another great old one.

**[34:05]** And I'm coming around on our last two independent great old ones to discuss and these ones are both

**[34:10]** completely off the rails so strap in. First we've got Harbinger Cthulhu. Again apologies I don't know

**[34:19]** who sculpted this one but you deserve some credit. This is nasty. It is physically large. It is

**[34:26]** comically large. Like I could use this as a club. This one could be a murder weapon. It is huge.

**[34:33]** I'm not sure exactly how much it weighs. My dog weighs 10 pounds. This thing is like

**[34:37]** quarter of a sunny half of a sunny. I'm not sure. Very nasty beast-like big paws and a really creepy

**[34:45]** looking Cthulhu face. Does not look exactly like Dire Cthulhu or regular Cthulhu's nice tentacly face.

**[34:52]** This one has like almost a human looking face and a beard. It is very gross and I also love the wings

**[34:59]** that kind of have like a they're like clasped hands with prayer at the top. Very cool looking and

**[35:05]** disgusting. How to awaken Harbinger Cthulhu. For a great Cthulhu faction specifically you'll pay

**[35:14]** eight Power and place Harbinger Cthulhu into any area. This counts as awakening Cthulhu if you haven't

**[35:20]** already done so. Then each other player gains an Elder Sign. All other factions you need to have a

**[35:27]** great old one in play and you'll need to pay eight Power and place Harbinger Cthulhu in any area.

**[35:32]** I keep emphasizing that because in either case when Harbinger Cthulhu is placed all units in target

**[35:40]** area are removed and placed on Harbinger Cthulhu's loyalty card. I'll leave room there for a dramatic

**[35:47]** pause. This unit does not have any combat but the ability is great old one. Ongoing ability.

**[35:56]** Harbinger Cthulhu cannot be moved from its area by any means except by destroying it and it has no

**[36:01]** Spellbook. When battled all the attackers units in the battle are destroyed. It takes at least three

**[36:08]** kills or eliminations in the same combat to kill Harbinger Cthulhu. I'll leave room for another

**[36:14]** dramatic pause there. When Harbinger Cthulhu is killed return all the units from this loyalty card

**[36:23]** to Harbinger Cthulhu's area. The player who killed Harbinger Cthulhu gets one Elder Sign as does the

**[36:29]** controller of Harbinger Cthulhu even if they're the same person. Wow so a very crazy swingy independent

**[36:37]** great old one. I have played with this one and I thought it was completely unfair and crazy.

**[36:44]** I like the prison elements here don't get me wrong like locking people away but I think there are some

**[36:49]** factions that would be absolutely screwed if you did this to them like Yellow Sign for example. If you hit

**[36:55]** Haster with this I just don't know how Yellow Sign is supposed to get this back. Forcing people to rely

**[37:02]** on others to set them free they're just not incentivized to do that at all. I think this is

**[37:06]** just going to bring an immense amount of salt to the game. This is definitely high on my list of like

**[37:12]** units to include in the masochistic game of Cthulhu Wars that everyone's going to hate.

**[37:17]** Can't recommend you use this one in good conscience. My story playing with this I was playing as Great

**[37:24]** Cthulhu myself and somebody used this against me and locked away Cthulhu and my star spawns and I

**[37:33]** ended up having to slowly over time move in Shoggoth, Deep Ones, all of my acolytes and in a big absorb

**[37:40]** battle I was able to break free. I end up rolling like 18 dice or something ridiculous because I wanted

**[37:46]** to be sure I got the three kills. Like I said this is just going to completely cripple certain factions so

**[37:52]** not at all balanced. You've been warned. This one is for the lulz. If you want to see what happens use

**[37:58]** this but yeah not not recommended for people who like competitive games of Cthulhu Wars. If you want

**[38:04]** to be silly this is one for you. And that's enough on Harbinger Cthulhu. I will move on to the final

**[38:12]** independent great old one we have. It is Haster the Risen. Apologies not knowing who sculpted this but

**[38:20]** truly a masterpiece. Not a great unit if you have limited space in your home because it is ginormous.

**[38:30]** Takes up a lot of horizontal space. I've called this one the dinner plate as a joke. Very metal

**[38:37]** looking. You've got Haster with his big mouth open. He's very psyched to be alive and he looks like he's

**[38:43]** connected to the king in yellow through like an umbilical cord. And the very coolest thing about

**[38:49]** this sculpt if you look at it from overhead it's actually tracing out the yellow sign glyph which

**[38:55]** is amazing easter egg. So whoever sculpted this incredible. How are we going to awaken the risen one?

**[39:06]** For the yellow sign specifically you're going to pay seven Power. Place the risen one at one of your

**[39:11]** controlled Gates and you may place it so that it overlaps into neighboring areas. Then each other

**[39:17]** player gains an Elder Sign. For all other factions you're going to need a controlled Gate in an area

**[39:23]** with your great old one and you may place the risen one so that overlaps into neighboring areas.

**[39:29]** You're also going to need to pay eight Power and place the risen one in the area containing the Gate.

**[39:36]** So why the text about the overlapping other areas? Well if you heard me earlier I called this one the

**[39:42]** dinner plate. It is like physically very large, circularly large. If you center it into one area

**[39:49]** it's still going to spill over into a bunch of other areas, at least three or four or five areas depending

**[39:54]** on where you are. Or depending on the player count it could be in many more areas at once. And why is that

**[40:00]** important? That is because of the reality ability. It's ongoing. The risen one is considered to exist in

**[40:07]** every area in which its base overlaps. It can attack into any of them, can move into any area adjacent

**[40:15]** to any of them, etc. That is pretty insane. It says etc here but like think about captures for example.

**[40:24]** Just being next to some Gate that doesn't have a great old one you can just capture. That's insanity.

**[40:30]** But wait there's more. The combat for this independent great old one it says choose any number.

**[40:36]** What? We've never seen anything like that before. And the ability other ability on here is madness.

**[40:44]** You may roll any number of dice for the risen one's battle total. However if the risen one side scores

**[40:50]** more kills than its opposition the risen one is eliminated. What? So you could roll like an

**[40:58]** arbitrarily large amount of combat dice so that you will guaranteed kill everything on the other side

**[41:03]** of the battle. Like you could just say like I'm rolling a million billion dice and law of large

**[41:08]** number says I will roll a bunch of kills and wipe out everything in the area and then the risen one's

**[41:14]** gonna die but I guess that's fine if you just like completely destroyed the Windwalker death ball in

**[41:19]** one battle. I think that's probably worth it. There's just so many possibilities here. Being able to be in

**[41:27]** multiple areas. Moving in the areas as well like you're kind of moving like two areas away if you

**[41:33]** can move into adjacent areas. I just this one breaks my brain. It's like actually ridiculous all the stuff

**[41:39]** that you can do with this. Again I wouldn't say this one is balanced but it sounds like our trip.

**[41:45]** I do own this one. I haven't gotten it onto the table. If you've limited space I don't know why you're

**[41:50]** listening to this podcast for because Cthulhu Wars itself just takes up a ridiculous amount of space.

**[41:55]** But this one in particular if you get it keep the box it came in because that would be a nice way to

**[42:00]** store it. Otherwise I don't know what you do with this.

**[42:06]** And yeah that's our last unit that we have to discuss so we're done. We're in our closing thoughts

**[42:12]** of this hodgepodge of neutral units episode. I'm not sure what to say here to be honest.

**[42:19]** Some listeners might be asking like Graham this is the last episode that you're going to do. What

**[42:25]** about the invasion faction? What about the 12th faction? What about the God's War crossover units?

**[42:32]** What about the fourth circle terrors from Planet Apocalypse? What about the color out of space

**[42:39]** investigators? Eidolon? I hear you. That's why I kind of called this one the season one finale

**[42:45]** because I don't really know what the future is going to be for this game.

**[42:51]** Regardless of your feelings about Peterson Games and all the shipping nonsense that happened with

**[42:55]** this most recent Kickstarter. If you love Cthulhu Wars we want Peterson Games to survive so that we

**[43:01]** can do season two for this podcast and do more hype have more things to discuss. So I'm saving some

**[43:08]** things in other words. I'm not doing any of these crossover units or the invasion which I'm considering

**[43:13]** a crossover. I'm saving it because if I ever do a season two I want there to be some content so that

**[43:19]** I can do you know maybe eight or ten more episodes. Who knows? I would love to interview Matt Folger who

**[43:26]** was the person that created the invasion faction. What became the invasion faction? I would love to do an

**[43:31]** episode about that. But I'm going to give myself what I think is a much deserved break. I really enjoyed

**[43:39]** doing this podcast. It's been a very very fun project but I gotta be honest sometimes it felt a bit like

**[43:45]** work and this monthly release schedule I imposed upon myself was not always easy to honor and I wasn't

**[43:53]** always excited to record or edit episodes and I'm glad that I saw it through to the end because I don't

**[44:01]** like leaving things incomplete. I don't want to ramble too much at the end of the episode here but

**[44:08]** on a personal note I'm just very happy I ended up doing this and that I got so much helpful words of

**[44:14]** encouragement from people who listened to this. Thank you anyone who's ever reached out just to say hi

**[44:19]** or that you enjoyed the cast. That's what kept me going through these times where I didn't really feel

**[44:26]** like recording. I considered not finishing the podcast. Every person that reached out to me you

**[44:32]** inspired me to keep going so I appreciate you so much. Thank you very much. I learned a lot doing this.

**[44:39]** My main purpose for doing this was to learn how to use Ableton recording software so that I could put

**[44:44]** it to use with music recording that's one of my other big passions. I've been a guitar player for like

**[44:50]** over 20 years at this point learning other instruments too, learning how to play the piano,

**[44:56]** but I want to start doing more music production too. I'm pretty disciplined about practicing but

**[45:01]** not very disciplined about recording and so this podcast was a great jumping off point to get me a

**[45:07]** little bit more familiar with the UI so that I can learn how to do some other musical stuff going forward.

**[45:14]** And lastly I think it was like a big confidence boost for me as someone that struggles with

**[45:19]** depression and anxiety. I've always been really apprehensive about creating something and putting

**[45:26]** it out in the world and getting feedback from people and I did do that with this podcast. It was

**[45:31]** really out of my comfort zone but I was really heartened to hear from everyone that's reached out

**[45:36]** to me that said like hey I love this cast. Thank you. That really did make a big difference for me.

**[45:42]** I now feel more confident going forward in other creative pursuits like the music thing. I want to record

**[45:49]** some music and put out some music and just see what people think of it. I like how the music guy makes

**[45:55]** sounds but I don't know how other people feel about it but now I'm feeling confident enough to

**[45:59]** share with others so maybe reach out to me if you want to hear something that I've recorded in the future.

**[46:08]** And yeah I really love Cthulhu Wars. I'll also say more personal things. Sorry this is getting heavy and

**[46:14]** personal here at the end but I'll always have a really special place in my heart for this game because

**[46:18]** it got me through some really dark times in my life. Very dark. During the pandemic that was one thing

**[46:25]** but I also had a period where I tore my Achilles tendon twice in one year. I couldn't walk for almost

**[46:32]** four months and I was really depressed and I needed something in my life to like keep me going and

**[46:41]** playing Cthulhu Wars was one thing. I'm really thankful to people I played with during that time and

**[46:47]** just studying it having something to occupy my mind and eventually doing this podcast that also was

**[46:54]** just a really big benefit to my mental health. So thanks again everyone that's listening because

**[47:01]** you've helped me get through a really dark time in my life and now I feel like everything is going in a

**[47:08]** really positive trajectory. It has been for over a year but looking forward to more bright things in my

**[47:15]** future and not like what I was living with for a long time in 2021 and into 2022.

**[47:25]** I don't want to end on kind of a downer note like that so let's also talk about the future.

**[47:31]** I'm assuming Peterson Games is going to survive. I'm assuming there's going to be things in the

**[47:35]** future so let's get hype about season two. What do we want to see in the future? For one thing,

**[47:40]** Invasion Faction, yeah definitely want to do a podcast about that for sure. I don't own the

**[47:47]** faction board or anything so I haven't even played it in real life so that's step number one. Planet

**[47:53]** Apocalypse needs to fulfill or something so that I can get a hold of the Invasion cardboard and do a

**[47:58]** proper faction. I have played with this one on Tabletop Simulator but it goes by another name over there,

**[48:04]** Anubis, so I need to still rewire my brain even to speak about the invasion with the Planet Apocalypse

**[48:11]** skin that it now has on it. I want to see even more factions. I think there's so much potential for

**[48:18]** more factions in this game if the will and the desire is there from Peterson Games.

**[48:24]** One that I've already heard them say that they are definitely doing is Mecha Cthulhu. I'm not sure

**[48:29]** exactly what that means but I'm excited about it. If it's anything like Mecha Godzilla, let's go. I'm

**[48:35]** super here for some robotic Cthulhu. I would love to see another faction that is just like

**[48:41]** all out fighting, punching everybody into submission, like an homage to Cthulhu but a little bit different.

**[48:48]** I would love to see something like that. Sounds amazing. We have, you know, Ramsey Campbell inspired

**[48:55]** independent great old ones but like I said I just read the whole three births of Daloth trilogy.

**[49:01]** So much material there for a Daloth faction. If there is the desire, I know Peterson Games could

**[49:08]** make at least another three or four factions. No problem. What else are we going to see? More neutral

**[49:14]** units. Dire Shub. Would love to see a Dire Shub. I've heard that rumored in the Peterson Games discord.

**[49:21]** I'll believe it when I see the real thing show up but I love Shub. I love Black Goat. I want to see

**[49:27]** a Dire Shub for sure. More clans. Can we see another clan? I would love to see a kind of Dreams in the

**[49:35]** Witch House clan. I'd love to see Brown Jenkin get rolled into a clan along with maybe Keziah Mason,

**[49:41]** the witch, who Brown Jenkin is the familiar of. That would be cool as hell. And lastly, obviously,

**[49:48]** more maps. There was a rumored Carcosa map that was being worked on for a while that maybe got scrapped.

**[49:55]** Let's see it. I don't care how crazy it is. If it's not balanced, let's see it. I can say from my

**[50:01]** episode statistics that people are most interested in listening to faction guides and then the next

**[50:07]** best thing is the map episode. So I know if we made another map it would be super popular and people

**[50:13]** want to play on it. So let's get another map or two. That would also be extremely hype.

**[50:20]** And yeah, that's another episode in the book. So thank you so much for listening to this final

**[50:25]** season one finale. I hope this isn't the last time that you hear from me. I hope to make some more

**[50:30]** episodes here in the future. That being said, I mean it this time. Rate, review, and subscribe.

**[50:37]** For real this time, do it. If you haven't already done it, write me a review. If you've listened to all

**[50:41]** my episodes and you haven't reviewed me, come on. Join the Cthulhu Wars Discord if you want to play

**[50:47]** games online with us on Tabletop Simulator. That is one thing I'll definitely be doing more of now

**[50:52]** that I'm done with the cast after I edit and produce these. That's where I'll be. Come find me over there

**[50:57]** if you want to play a game. If you want to contact me, feel free to send me an email at

**[51:03]** openingthewaypod at gmail.com. Probably won't be checking that too much more frequently. Or send me a

**[51:09]** message on Discord at Kilogram, where I am around a lot. And yeah, I think that's it for this episode.

**[51:16]** Another episode in the books. Take care of yourself wherever you are in the world, and I hope you have

**[51:22]** a bright future ahead, and a great day, a great evening, a great morning, wherever it is that you are.

**[51:27]** Thanks. Bye.
