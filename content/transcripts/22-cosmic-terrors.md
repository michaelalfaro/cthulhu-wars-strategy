## Transcript

**[00:00]** Meanwhile, the displaced mind, prone back to the displacer's age and body, would be carefully guarded.

**[00:07]** It would be kept from harming the body it occupied, and would be drained of all its knowledge by trained questioners.

**[00:14]** Often it could be questioned in its own language when previous quests into the future had brought back records of that language.

**[00:21]** If the mind came from a body whose language the great race could not physically reproduce,

**[00:26]** clever machines would be made, on which the alien speech could be played as on a musical instrument.

**[00:33]** The great race's members were immense rugos cones ten feet high,

**[00:37]** and with head and other organs attached to foot-thick, distensible limbs spreading from the apexes.

**[00:43]** They spoke by the clicking or scraping of huge paws or claws attached to the end of two of their four limbs,

**[00:49]** and walked by the expansion and contraction of viscous layer attached to their vast ten-foot bases.

**[00:56]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:19]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[01:21]** Hope you're doing well. Hope it's cool and bearable wherever you are.

**[01:28]** The heat's been pretty bad lately. It seems like throughout the world.

**[01:32]** So hopefully you're staying hydrated and you're staying cool, and hopefully you're finding some relief from the heat.

**[01:40]** Today's episode, we're going to be discussing the Cosmic Terrors expansion.

**[01:45]** This is an expansion that contains three different neutral terrors that you can add to your games of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:55]** Quick recap on what terrors are.

**[01:58]** If you don't know, they're pretty much monsters in every way,

**[02:02]** other than Spellbooks that target monsters can't target terrors.

**[02:06]** So for example, terror can't be devoured by devour because it only eats monsters.

**[02:11]** They can't be invisibled by flying polyps.

**[02:16]** You buy them the same way that you would buy a neutral monster by paying for them in the Doom phase,

**[02:21]** but you'll be paying two Doom and two Power,

**[02:24]** so a little bit more expensive than summoning a neutral monster in the Doom phase.

**[02:29]** What you heard in the intro there was a little bit from the story The Shadow Out of Time by H.P. Lovecraft.

**[02:38]** That was published in 1936.

**[02:41]** And it's in reference to our first terror that we're going to discuss,

**[02:45]** which is the Great Race of Yith.

**[02:48]** The description of the story is pretty on point describing these things.

**[02:52]** It just kind of looks like a big cone.

**[02:55]** I'm not sure what this thing in the middle is.

**[02:58]** Maybe some kind of a weapon.

**[03:00]** I can see that there's a head.

**[03:01]** They have probably some tentacles for a mouth,

**[03:05]** but there's multiple appendages here.

**[03:07]** I'm not actually sure what's what.

**[03:09]** I can see the arms.

**[03:10]** I can see what I think is the head.

**[03:12]** There might be a second head.

**[03:13]** I'm not totally sure, but maybe I'm not meant to know.

**[03:17]** To summon the Great Race of Yith,

**[03:21]** you'll have to pay 2 Doom and 2 Power to obtain their loyalty card,

**[03:25]** and then you'll place the Great Race at one of your controlled Gates.

**[03:29]** Great Race has a cost of 4 and a combat of 3.

**[03:34]** The ability on the Great Race of Yith is Possession.

**[03:37]** It's ongoing and in the gather Power phase.

**[03:39]** I think this unit is great.

**[04:05]** The ability to capture regardless of any units,

**[04:09]** including other Great Old Ones, that's very notable.

**[04:12]** It makes this very, very strong.

**[04:15]** Not every Great Old One is going to be a Powerhouse

**[04:18]** that's rolling a lot of combat dice,

**[04:20]** and normally people count on their Great Old Ones

**[04:22]** in order to protect their acolytes from capture,

**[04:25]** and the Great Race just ignores all that.

**[04:27]** They have the technology,

**[04:29]** they know how to capture your mind,

**[04:31]** and they're going to do it.

**[04:32]** I also love that they just randomly put the rider in there about Ferox too,

**[04:38]** so this thing is just very excellent at capturing Cultists.

**[04:43]** Even Ferox, it just kind of laps it off

**[04:45]** and does whatever it wants.

**[04:47]** I love that against Windwalker.

**[04:50]** Not only the capturing thing,

**[04:52]** which is going to make it very easy for you

**[04:54]** to take Gates away from people,

**[04:57]** hopefully clean them for yourself,

**[04:58]** you're also getting double the Power back on Gather Power,

**[05:01]** so just with two captures alone,

**[05:04]** that's four Power,

**[05:05]** that's like most of a ritual,

**[05:07]** a decent chunk of a ritual,

**[05:09]** or whatever else you're planning on spending it on.

**[05:12]** Four Power is very significant.

**[05:14]** Even a single capture feels really, really nice with this one.

**[05:18]** The only challenge is figuring out

**[05:20]** how to get it into the right locations safely,

**[05:23]** where it can capture to its heart's content.

**[05:26]** Yeah, you don't want this thing getting killed, obviously,

**[05:29]** but it does have a decent combat for the cost as well,

**[05:33]** so assuming you can get it somewhere safely and start capturing,

**[05:36]** I think it's going to pay for itself really quickly.

**[05:40]** You figure you should be able to probably steal at least one Gate with this,

**[05:44]** and so in that sense,

**[05:45]** I think that it's probably worth the two doom and the two Power.

**[05:48]** For sure you're going to get the two Power back right away

**[05:51]** if you capture something,

**[05:53]** but I also think because this makes it so easy to capture

**[05:56]** and take Gates away from people,

**[05:58]** the two doom does feel like it's worth it to buy this terror.

**[06:02]** Super recommend this one.

**[06:04]** I think every faction is pretty interested in this.

**[06:07]** Probably the turtley, chocho style factions

**[06:11]** would be less interested in this

**[06:13]** than something that's more mobile,

**[06:15]** like a crawling chaos or something with a death ball,

**[06:17]** but if someone has a great old one

**[06:20]** that doesn't happen to be rolling a lot of dice

**[06:22]** and they are posted up adjacent to you,

**[06:25]** I'm fine moving this in

**[06:26]** and just trying to capture and see what happens.

**[06:31]** Let's move on to our next terror.

**[06:34]** This is the dole.

**[06:36]** D-H-O-L-E,

**[06:37]** not to be confused with the bull,

**[06:39]** which you can find in the Dreamlands.

**[06:43]** This thing is very large.

**[06:44]** Might be one of the bigger neutral unit sculpts.

**[06:48]** It's very cool looking.

**[06:50]** It looks like it's bursting out of the ground.

**[06:53]** I'm getting major dune vibes from this thing.

**[06:55]** It's a huge worm.

**[06:57]** It's got like a nice triangular mouth

**[06:59]** with a set of three big looking teeth.

**[07:04]** Definitely looks like it would mess you up.

**[07:05]** I would not want to be around

**[07:07]** when it pops out of the ground.

**[07:08]** To summon the dole,

**[07:11]** you'll need to pay two doom and two Power

**[07:14]** to obtain their loyalty card

**[07:15]** and then place the dole at any one of your controlled Gates.

**[07:19]** The dole costs four Power to summon

**[07:21]** and has a five for combat.

**[07:23]** The ability on the dole is planetary destruction.

**[07:28]** It's post-battle ability.

**[07:30]** If the dole is killed or eliminated in battle,

**[07:33]** earn two Elder Signs.

**[07:34]** Additionally,

**[07:35]** your opponent gains your choice of two doom or two Power.

**[07:39]** So this is a bit of a great Cthulhu immortal-like ability.

**[07:47]** For Cthulhu,

**[07:49]** you only get one Elder Sign for immortal,

**[07:51]** so it's not your plan A,

**[07:54]** like, you know,

**[07:54]** getting it killed intentionally.

**[07:56]** I wouldn't say that's necessarily your plan with the dole either,

**[07:59]** but it will pay for itself

**[08:01]** the first time that you get it killed, notably.

**[08:03]** You'll get the two Elder Signs.

**[08:05]** That's a minimum of two doom.

**[08:07]** If you manage to get this killed twice,

**[08:09]** you're profiting in terms of doom.

**[08:11]** So I do think this one is worth it

**[08:14]** because it will pay for itself pretty quickly.

**[08:18]** When this dies,

**[08:19]** you will have to give away

**[08:21]** to the person that you just fought

**[08:22]** that rolled the kill.

**[08:23]** You'll need to give them two doom or two Power.

**[08:26]** So depending on the situation,

**[08:28]** maybe you're not going to want to give them two Power.

**[08:30]** If that means that they're going to keep fighting you,

**[08:32]** you will have, like,

**[08:33]** maybe paid for their move

**[08:35]** and their combat against you.

**[08:36]** I don't love giving people a rebate on that,

**[08:39]** but I leave that up to you.

**[08:41]** Sometimes that's definitely going to be better

**[08:42]** than giving someone two doom.

**[08:44]** If your opponent's in the 20-ish doom

**[08:47]** and they have some Elder Signs,

**[08:48]** I'm not giving them the two doom.

**[08:49]** I'm giving them the two Power every single time.

**[08:54]** What factions like this?

**[08:56]** I think anything that has a death ball

**[09:00]** that they can move around is going to like this,

**[09:02]** that they can just throw a kill on

**[09:03]** and gain some Elder Signs.

**[09:05]** So any mobile factions,

**[09:07]** like Crawling Chaos,

**[09:09]** Windwalker,

**[09:10]** Great Cthulhu would like this.

**[09:12]** Even a defensive faction would enjoy this,

**[09:14]** I think.

**[09:15]** Just hiding behind it,

**[09:16]** putting a kill on it.

**[09:17]** Imagine you're, like,

**[09:18]** trying to fight the Chocho

**[09:20]** or Demon Sultan,

**[09:21]** but they have a dole at their Gate.

**[09:23]** They're going to be pretty happy

**[09:24]** to be rolling five extra dice on defense

**[09:27]** and gain some Elder Signs from it.

**[09:31]** This is another solid terror.

**[09:32]** I think I would recommend this one.

**[09:34]** I think it pays for itself.

**[09:35]** I think you'd be pretty happy

**[09:36]** buying this in one of your games.

**[09:43]** Now we'll move on to our last cosmic terror.

**[09:47]** That is Kwakil Utaus.

**[09:50]** I don't know how you pronounce this name.

**[09:52]** I'm probably butchering it.

**[09:54]** The olden wizards knew him

**[09:58]** and named him Kwakil Utaus.

**[10:01]** Seldom is he revealed,

**[10:02]** for he dwelleth beyond the outermost circle,

**[10:05]** in the dark limbo of unsphered time and space.

**[10:09]** Dreadful is the word that calleth him,

**[10:11]** though the word be unspoken save in thought.

**[10:14]** For Kwakil Utaus is the ultimate corruption,

**[10:17]** and the instant of his coming

**[10:19]** is like the passage of many ages,

**[10:21]** and neither flesh nor stone

**[10:23]** may abide his treading.

**[10:25]** But all things crumble beneath it,

**[10:27]** Adam from Adam.

**[10:29]** And for this,

**[10:30]** some have called him

**[10:30]** the Treader of the Dust.

**[10:35]** The Treader of the Dust,

**[10:37]** as you've heard,

**[10:38]** that is from the story of the same name

**[10:40]** by Clark Ashton Smith,

**[10:42]** and I think it was published in 1935.

**[10:45]** This one looks pretty funny,

**[10:50]** honestly.

**[10:50]** It did a good job of making this one

**[10:54]** look like it's a cloud of dust,

**[10:55]** and it's kind of just got a little

**[10:56]** adolescent infant reaching its hands out.

**[11:00]** I haven't read the Treader in Dust yet,

**[11:01]** but my understanding is this

**[11:03]** terror just kind of touches you,

**[11:05]** and you age instantly and turn into dust,

**[11:07]** and that seems pretty rough.

**[11:08]** Seems like that is reflected in the ability.

**[11:11]** To summon Quackle,

**[11:16]** you'll have to pay 2 Doom and 2 Power

**[11:18]** to obtain their loyalty card,

**[11:20]** and then you place them

**[11:21]** at one of your controlled Gates.

**[11:23]** This terror has a cost of 4

**[11:25]** and a combat of 1.

**[11:28]** The ability on this is Dust to Dust,

**[11:31]** a post-battle.

**[11:32]** If an enemy unit is killed

**[11:33]** or eliminated in a battle

**[11:35]** involving Quackle Utaos,

**[11:37]** that unit's owner must choose

**[11:39]** one of the following options.

**[11:41]** Select one of their units

**[11:42]** to be permanently removed from the game,

**[11:44]** ouch,

**[11:45]** or you gain an Elder Sign.

**[11:49]** Seems pretty great

**[11:51]** if you can get this unit

**[11:53]** into some fights

**[11:54]** and manage to keep it alive

**[11:55]** alongside some other combat dice.

**[11:58]** Hopefully you're rolling

**[11:59]** at least one kill.

**[12:01]** All of these options

**[12:02]** are not going to be nice

**[12:03]** for your opponents.

**[12:04]** If you manage to get

**[12:07]** an Elder Sign or 2,

**[12:08]** great,

**[12:08]** this has paid for itself

**[12:09]** in terms of Doom,

**[12:10]** so another worthwhile terror

**[12:12]** to purchase,

**[12:13]** in my opinion.

**[12:15]** Unfortunate that it only has

**[12:16]** one combat on its own,

**[12:18]** but you know,

**[12:18]** it is what it is.

**[12:20]** If this were rolling 3 or 4,

**[12:21]** it would be really strong.

**[12:24]** I think this could be used

**[12:25]** on defense too

**[12:26]** to augment

**[12:27]** an already fortified position,

**[12:29]** but probably better

**[12:30]** to be the one

**[12:31]** proactively picking fights

**[12:33]** with this.

**[12:33]** So you can make sure

**[12:34]** you have the dice

**[12:35]** alongside this

**[12:36]** to make sure

**[12:37]** to trigger Dust to Dust

**[12:38]** its post-battle ability.

**[12:42]** What factions like this?

**[12:44]** Definitely the mobile

**[12:45]** fighty factions,

**[12:46]** I think,

**[12:46]** prefer this,

**[12:47]** and they can definitely

**[12:48]** make you very sad

**[12:50]** by fighting you

**[12:50]** multiple times.

**[12:52]** I know I would not

**[12:53]** want to be on

**[12:54]** the receiving end

**[12:55]** of Great Cthulhu

**[12:56]** popping out of the ocean

**[12:57]** with Quokkil in tow.

**[12:59]** You're probably going to end up

**[13:00]** forking over

**[13:01]** some Elder Signs.

**[13:02]** Even giving up

**[13:04]** your worst monsters

**[13:05]** or acolytes,

**[13:07]** I'm not keen on doing that.

**[13:09]** I don't ever like

**[13:10]** having my Gate potential

**[13:12]** limited,

**[13:12]** so I'm inclined to

**[13:13]** give away the Elder Sign

**[13:15]** for this,

**[13:15]** but yikes,

**[13:16]** it's not a great choice,

**[13:17]** so hopefully you're able

**[13:18]** to avoid these fights

**[13:19]** where Quokkil's rolling

**[13:20]** kills against you.

**[13:24]** And I think those are all

**[13:25]** the Cosmic Terror

**[13:26]** spoken for.

**[13:27]** My closing thoughts

**[13:29]** on this expansion,

**[13:31]** I think it's all

**[13:32]** pretty solid.

**[13:34]** You know,

**[13:34]** my main issue

**[13:35]** with neutrals in general,

**[13:37]** I think they need

**[13:37]** to really be worth

**[13:38]** that two Doom

**[13:39]** that you pay,

**[13:40]** because that is something

**[13:41]** that you're giving up.

**[13:43]** Could,

**[13:43]** you know,

**[13:44]** potentially extend the game

**[13:45]** or even cost you

**[13:46]** the win

**[13:47]** in the worst cases,

**[13:48]** but what I like

**[13:49]** about all of these

**[13:50]** is I do think

**[13:51]** that they

**[13:52]** pay for themselves

**[13:53]** in some way,

**[13:54]** whether that's like

**[13:55]** directly in terms

**[13:57]** of Elder Signs

**[13:57]** and Doom

**[13:58]** for Quokkil

**[13:59]** and the Dole,

**[14:00]** or indirectly

**[14:01]** in terms of

**[14:03]** the Great Race

**[14:03]** and the ability

**[14:04]** to just like

**[14:05]** capture in spite

**[14:06]** of the presence

**[14:07]** of Great Old Ones.

**[14:08]** All of these

**[14:08]** seem pretty solid to me.

**[14:10]** I wouldn't be unhappy

**[14:11]** to buy them

**[14:12]** in any game

**[14:13]** that I ended up playing.

**[14:16]** Hopefully you can

**[14:18]** get them into

**[14:19]** one of your future games

**[14:20]** and definitely

**[14:21]** let me know

**[14:21]** how that goes.

**[14:22]** I've played with

**[14:24]** the Dole,

**[14:24]** I've played with

**[14:25]** the Great Race,

**[14:26]** I've not played

**[14:27]** with Quokkil,

**[14:27]** so I'd like to see

**[14:28]** that one in action

**[14:29]** sometime soon.

**[14:31]** I've seen the Dole

**[14:31]** rack in, I think,

**[14:32]** like six Elder Signs

**[14:33]** over the course

**[14:34]** of the game,

**[14:34]** it seemed quite good.

**[14:36]** Great Race,

**[14:37]** I've only seen it

**[14:38]** once or twice,

**[14:39]** and I don't really

**[14:40]** think it made

**[14:40]** great use of the

**[14:41]** ability to capture

**[14:43]** around Great Old Ones,

**[14:44]** but I leave that

**[14:45]** up to you.

**[14:46]** I think you could

**[14:46]** definitely engineer

**[14:47]** a situation in which

**[14:49]** you reap a ton

**[14:50]** of Power off of this,

**[14:51]** if not also

**[14:53]** a ton of Gates.

**[14:56]** And I think that

**[14:57]** is another episode

**[14:58]** in the book,

**[14:58]** so thank you

**[14:59]** very much for

**[15:00]** listening.

**[15:03]** found this useful.
