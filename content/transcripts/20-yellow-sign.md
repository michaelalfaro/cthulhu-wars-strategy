## Transcript

**[00:00]** Along the shore the cloud waves break, the twin suns sink beneath the lake, the

**[00:05]** shadows lengthened in Carcosa. Strange is the night where the black stars rise, and

**[00:11]** strange moons circle the skies, but stranger still is lost Carcosa. Songs that

**[00:19]** the Hyades shall sing, where flap the tatters of the king, must die unheard in

**[00:24]** dim Carcosa. Song of my soul, my voice is dead. Die thou unsung as tears unshed,

**[00:33]** shall dry and die in lost Carcosa.

**[00:38]** Hello and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of

**[00:59]** Cthulhu Wars. My name is Graham and I'll be your host. Hope you're doing well. I'm

**[01:07]** recording this episode over the 4th of July weekend in the United States. I'm

**[01:13]** really thankful to have four days off. The last week at work for me has been a

**[01:18]** gauntlet, but it went actually really well. It was one of those weeks where you

**[01:24]** might have a lot of anxiety at the beginning of the week, and by the end of

**[01:28]** the week things just went unbelievably well, and that's very unusual at my job,

**[01:33]** so I'm thankful for that. It also seems like air quality is getting a lot better

**[01:38]** where I am in Pennsylvania. Earlier this week there was a lot of smoke from

**[01:42]** wildfires in Canada. I've lived here my whole life. I've never seen the air be

**[01:48]** less visible than it was this week. It was downright apocalyptic. I couldn't see

**[01:55]** downtown as I drove into work. Yeah, it was very odd. Even when the sun was out,

**[02:01]** it wasn't really coming through because of there was so much smoke, so I hope to

**[02:06]** not see that too too often in the future because it was pretty spooky not being

**[02:11]** able to really go out for walks or even take my dog out for a long walk. I've

**[02:17]** been very excited to record this episode for some time, and hopefully it's not

**[02:23]** coming too late for some fans here, but today we're going to be finally

**[02:29]** discussing the last of the classic base game factions. We'll be discussing Yellow

**[02:34]** Sign. This faction, Yellow Sign, is based on the story The King in Yellow by

**[02:42]** Robert Chambers. The story was published super long time ago, 1895, well predating

**[02:52]** Lovecraft. I've heard that Lovecraft considered this the scariest story that

**[02:57]** he ever read, so that's pretty interesting. This is one of the first, and

**[03:03]** there's other authors here to go over too, this is one of the first authors

**[03:06]** that indirectly, heavily contributed to the mythos. They made something that

**[03:11]** really was inspiring to Lovecraft, so that's pretty cool that someone was able

**[03:15]** to do that and that Lovecraft himself was so spooked by this story. Definitely

**[03:21]** check it out, The King in Yellow. It's sort of a book of short stories, and it's

**[03:26]** all sort of very disjointed, very like unreliable narrator. Things are not as

**[03:32]** they seem as you read through it. Basically just a bunch of different

**[03:36]** people coming into contact with The King in Yellow play, which makes people go

**[03:41]** insane after they read it, and they kind of end up going crazy in a variety of

**[03:45]** different ways. So you'll kind of see that as you read through the short

**[03:49]** stories here. It was very creepy, difficult to read in that it was so all

**[03:55]** over the place. It gets across the theme of like madness and paranoia really

**[04:02]** really well, better than a lot of stories.

**[04:06]** Okay, back to Yellow Sign in Cthulhu Wars now that we got that literary stuff out

**[04:12]** of the way. This is the classical engine faction in Cthulhu Wars. If you compare

**[04:20]** to the other three factions in the base game, I would say Crawling Chaos and

**[04:25]** Cthulhu are pretty much on that fighty side of things. Black Goat maybe

**[04:29]** somewhere in the middle, definitely not on the fighty side. Yellow Sign I'd say

**[04:33]** squarely is in the like doom-loving factions side of things. Yellow Sign is

**[04:41]** often going to win the game through use of the King in Yellow's Desecrate

**[04:46]** ability, which we'll talk a lot more about. This faction tends to win by

**[04:52]** accumulating Elder Signs as they travel around the map, the King with his

**[04:57]** entourage of undead. It won't be totally unusual to see a Yellow Sign game. If

**[05:04]** they're gonna win, they might have anywhere between, who knows, 6 to 12 Elder

**[05:10]** Signs. You've probably lost at that point. If King is starting to get close to

**[05:13]** double digits of Elder Signs, the game's over. This is another faction that has

**[05:18]** multiple Great Old Ones, in this case two. You've got the King in Yellow and you've

**[05:23]** got Hastur. The King is very cheap but frail, and the other, Hastur, is very

**[05:32]** expensive, costs 10 Power, but is very deadly in combat. The interesting

**[05:39]** thing about this is these both kind of need to exist on the map at the same

**[05:43]** time in order for the Yellow Sign faction to really be doing their thing

**[05:47]** with desecrating as efficiently as possible. Yellow Sign is going to be

**[05:53]** traveling around the map, trying to Desecrate in specific areas. You'll

**[05:58]** notice on the Earth map, on any map, there are these three different glyphs. One

**[06:02]** kind of looks like a scratching, like a nails on a chalkboard looking thing. One

**[06:07]** is like a chevron, sort of arc-a shaped glyph, and there's also like a circular

**[06:15]** glyph. I've heard it called the Ouroboros glyph, so I'm gonna just keep calling it

**[06:20]** by that for the rest of this guide. This faction does not like direct

**[06:26]** confrontation, doesn't tend to roll a lot of combat dice, not very useful in a

**[06:31]** fight, though it does have a couple of tricks in order to take on some combats

**[06:36]** as necessary. I can say personally I didn't always love this faction. I

**[06:43]** actually was one of my least favorite factions when I started playing, but my

**[06:47]** advice to anybody who feels that way about any faction in this game would be

**[06:51]** like, just sit down and force yourself to play them a bunch. Maybe something will

**[06:54]** change, and that really has happened with me and Yellow Sign. Used to be one of my

**[06:59]** least favorite factions, now I would say it's among my favorite factions, and I

**[07:05]** think that's because there's a lot more play to this faction than it seems on

**[07:08]** the surface. I've definitely got some hot takes about playing this one, and I

**[07:15]** would be sure to tell you all about them as we get through this guide. It's

**[07:21]** typical for the Yellow Sign to get played just one way, that's kind of what

**[07:26]** I've mentioned in the overview here, just desecrating everywhere, accumulating a

**[07:30]** lot of Elder Signs, but don't be fooled, this faction has a lot of tricks up its

**[07:35]** sleeve, and I'm gonna hopefully cover all of them, so if you don't know how to play

**[07:39]** Yellow Sign, hopefully you'll have a very full understanding of them after this,

**[07:43]** and if you do consider yourself a Yellow Sign player, maybe I will teach you a

**[07:49]** couple of new tricks that you can employ in your games in the future. I'd like to

**[07:57]** dedicate this episode to my friend Maggie, who always plays Cthulhu Wars

**[08:02]** with me when I play in real life. Maggie loves to play the Yellow Sign. We like to

**[08:07]** play a game where we see how quickly Maggie will say, fuck you, Graham, during the

**[08:12]** game, and the last game I think we made it into the second action phase before

**[08:18]** that happened, so Maggie, I hope you enjoy this episode.

**[08:25]** Let's go over the setup for Yellow Sign. It is very straightforward. If you're on

**[08:30]** Earth, you're always going to be in Europe, and on every other map it's going

**[08:34]** to be six acolytes, eight Power, with a Gate that has the Yellow Sign glyph. Not a

**[08:40]** variable start location, the same as the other three base factions. The unique

**[08:46]** faction ability for Yellow Sign is Feast. It's an ongoing ability. During gather

**[08:52]** Power, gain one Power for each area containing both a desecration token and

**[08:57]** one of your units. We'll explain in detail about desecration tokens here in

**[09:03]** a minute, but over the course of the game you're going to need to Desecrate in at

**[09:07]** least three different areas on the map and place these tokens, and after you

**[09:12]** have, if you have any units there during gather Power, you're just going to earn

**[09:16]** an additional Power. This can be kind of a nice way to earn extra Power as this

**[09:22]** faction. If you're ever able to like hold down an area with a Gate and

**[09:26]** Desecrate there, you'll be earning an extra Power. It's pretty nice and it can

**[09:31]** add up to like significant gains. If you can earn like three to four extra Power

**[09:37]** from feasting, that's really good. That's paying for like half of most of a ritual

**[09:43]** of annihilation, and if Yellow Sign can get off a couple of rituals with both

**[09:47]** their great old ones and a couple of Gates, that's really all you need to

**[09:50]** close out the game on top of any other Elder Signs you might earn from

**[09:54]** desecrating. This is another unique faction ability that is definitely

**[10:00]** useful, but I wouldn't say is like your primary goal is to feast. If you can take

**[10:05]** advantage of it, great, but I've seen plenty of games where you may be gaining

**[10:10]** one or two or

**[10:11]** even zero Power from feast, and it's still working out well for the yellow sign, so don't

**[10:15]** get too caught up on trying to earn as much Power from this as possible.

**[10:23]** Okay let's go over the Spellbook requirements for yellow sign now.

**[10:27]** The first three, I'll talk a bit about them as a group, but they do have some individual

**[10:32]** characteristics.

**[10:33]** I'm going to do a lot of these guides, if you haven't noticed, doing them really based

**[10:37]** like you're playing on earth, so that's going to be very much informing these three Spellbook

**[10:44]** requirements for yellow sign.

**[10:47]** They are all about desecrating in a certain area on the map with a certain glyph.

**[10:52]** Those three glyphs I mentioned earlier, scratching glyph, got to come up with a better name for

**[10:57]** it, chevron glyph, and ouroboros glyph.

**[11:00]** First one, Desecrate with a scratching glyph, that would be on earth anywhere in like the

**[11:06]** Eurasia area.

**[11:08]** There's Europe, Scandinavia, North Asia, South Asia, Arabia.

**[11:13]** This is a very much an easy place to earn your first Desecrate because you're going

**[11:18]** to be nearby most likely as the game starts unfolding.

**[11:24]** Next we have Desecrate in a chevron glyph.

**[11:28]** That is the Africas and Australia on earth, that's West Africa, East Africa, Australia.

**[11:35]** Australia very much disconnected from the other chevron glyph areas.

**[11:40]** There's some adjacency to the scratching glyph that I mentioned, the Eurasian glyph if you

**[11:45]** will, so if you're next door to the Africas with the chevron glyph, hopefully you're in

**[11:53]** Arabia getting your claw, maybe I'll call it the claw glyph from here on out.

**[12:00]** Lastly you've got the Desecrate in a circle ouroboros glyph, that's on earth North America

**[12:06]** and South America.

**[12:08]** There is the least amount, at least on earth, the least amount of areas containing a matching

**[12:12]** glyph here.

**[12:13]** It's also the most remote from the other areas that you'll need to Desecrate in, but that

**[12:18]** I mean it's like separated by water.

**[12:21]** Like I was saying earlier, you can be able to get your claw glyph somewhere in Europe.

**[12:26]** Hopefully Arabia is a good place to do it, and then if you need to go to Africa to get

**[12:31]** your chevron glyph, you will have to cross the ocean in order to get to one of the Americas

**[12:36]** and Desecrate to get your ouroboros glyph.

**[12:40]** I'd say this is one of the last areas you'll be getting this desecration off in usually,

**[12:45]** and you'll have to be careful because people will be watching for where you have and haven't

**[12:50]** Desecrated in as the game goes on, and they might try to stop you from desecrating in

**[12:56]** one of those America areas, but we'll talk a bit about how to mitiGate that later.

**[13:02]** Next Spellbook requirement, give another player three doom as an action.

**[13:07]** This is a quote-unquote free Spellbook for the yellow sign faction to take.

**[13:13]** You can use this in a couple of different ways.

**[13:16]** The first would be like use it politically.

**[13:20]** Somebody is thinking about coming after you.

**[13:23]** Get to talking with people.

**[13:24]** See if you can make a deal with somebody like, I'll give you three free doom if you

**[13:28]** completely leave me alone this action phase and don't come after me in any way.

**[13:32]** That's a great one.

**[13:34]** You can also just enable a bit of shenanigans with this by taking it extremely early on

**[13:39]** and just earning one of your Spellbooks at basically no cost.

**[13:43]** I'll talk more about that in the opening section, but that's something I also really like to

**[13:47]** do is just YOLO right at the start of the game, take a Spellbook and give the doom away

**[13:51]** to somebody and not particularly care who it is.

**[13:55]** Although the one thing I would say if you're going to go that route is think about which

**[14:00]** factions are in the game.

**[14:02]** Do not give this to any other doom-loving faction.

**[14:05]** So Cho-Cho, Demon Sultan, Ancients, that's a no-no.

**[14:11]** Don't give them three free doom.

**[14:12]** The cats, do not give them three free doom.

**[14:16]** Everyone is going to be mad at you later.

**[14:19]** When the game is over, people are going to tell you to look at the scoreboard and they'll

**[14:22]** say, hey, the Cho-Cho won with 31 and you gave them three doom, so this one's on you.

**[14:29]** You don't want to be in that position.

**[14:31]** It will happen occasionally, but yeah, I would opt to give it to the factions that earn doom

**[14:36]** a little more slowly and not some of these Ancient factions.

**[14:43]** Next Spellbook requirement is Awaken the King in Yellow.

**[14:47]** We'll go over the awakening requirements later, but the King is pretty cheap.

**[14:51]** It's only four Power to awaken.

**[14:54]** More on that in a bit.

**[14:56]** Typically it's pretty common to earn this Spellbook requirement as early as the first

**[15:01]** action phase.

**[15:02]** You're going to want to get this one pretty soon, action phase two at the latest.

**[15:10]** Last Spellbook requirement is Awaken Hastur and you get to gain an Elder Sign.

**[15:16]** Hastur is very expensive.

**[15:18]** It's all the way at the top of the curve for Great Old Ones alongside Narlathotep and the

**[15:23]** first time you awaken Cthulhu, Hastur is ten Power to awaken every time.

**[15:27]** It's a steep cost, but you're going to want to do this early.

**[15:32]** Earliest you'll be able to do this is action phase two, as typical with the other factions.

**[15:36]** That's because one of your Spellbooks we'll talk more about, Third Eye, is pretty key

**[15:40]** to your strategy.

**[15:41]** You get an Elder Sign for free when you take this Spellbook.

**[15:45]** That's cool.

**[15:46]** I'm not sure this is super necessary, but we take those any time you want.

**[15:49]** Hopefully you pull a two or a three.

**[15:51]** That's amazing.

**[15:52]** I think that's it for the Spellbook requirements, so we can start getting into the units for

**[15:59]** Yellow Sign.

**[16:02]** Starting with the acolytes, I'm looking at one of the alternate acolytes here.

**[16:07]** It's a lady in what looks like some sort of evening dress.

**[16:11]** She got an open book in her hand.

**[16:13]** Maybe it's the king in yellow.

**[16:16]** The Spellbook that works with acolytes is Passion.

**[16:21]** It's amazing.

**[16:22]** If you get your acolytes killed or captured, you'll be able to gain a little bit of a refund

**[16:27]** on Power.

**[16:28]** We'll talk more about that later.

**[16:32]** Next unit we have the undead.

**[16:35]** Looks a bit like a mummy, although it's really like a zombie, but it seems like tentacles

**[16:41]** have started to take over.

**[16:44]** That's kind of like a little bit of a theme with some of these other Yellow Sign units

**[16:47]** here.

**[16:48]** This one is really creepy looking.

**[16:50]** I don't know.

**[16:51]** Really long tongue coming out of the mouth.

**[16:53]** Maybe it's also a tentacle.

**[16:54]** I'm not sure.

**[16:55]** All across the back, it's not clear if it's bandages and or tentacles, but I'm here for

**[17:01]** it.

**[17:02]** These undeads look very nasty and creepy.

**[17:06]** You've got six undead in your pool.

**[17:09]** They cost one to summon, and their combat is a little strange.

**[17:15]** Equal to the number of undead in the battle minus one.

**[17:18]** So one undead in the battle doesn't roll any dice, two undead in the battle rolls one dice,

**[17:23]** and so on.

**[17:25]** These are nice units.

**[17:27]** They're very cheap, notably, even if they can't roll a lot of combat.

**[17:30]** We've talked many, many times across these episodes about how one-cost actions are good

**[17:36]** in Cthulhu Wars, and you've got six of them here with the amount of undead in your pool.

**[17:43]** They're pretty key to your strategy.

**[17:45]** We'll go over a little bit more later.

**[17:47]** They'll be able to travel around with the King in Yellow for free using the Screaming

**[17:52]** Dead Spellbook, we'll discuss, and they kind of are just an entourage that can soak up

**[17:57]** kills for the king.

**[17:58]** They also assist with desecrations.

**[18:01]** More on that in a minute.

**[18:03]** A Spellbook that works with the undead is called Zingaya.

**[18:06]** That lets the undead turn opposing Cultists into undead, and I think this one is criminally

**[18:13]** underused.

**[18:14]** I'll talk more about that later.

**[18:15]** It can be a very effective way to take out Gates and take control of Gates that have

**[18:20]** maybe only one acolyte guarding them, in a similar way to Dreams.

**[18:26]** The next unit for Yellow Sign, we have the Bayaki.

**[18:29]** I think that's how you pronounce them, I've heard Bayaki.

**[18:31]** I like Bayaki better.

**[18:33]** Yeah, these are very insectile looking.

**[18:38]** Kind of looks like a locust.

**[18:40]** It's got a little bit of a bee vibe, or a grub.

**[18:44]** The bottom of this is too bulbous and grub-like.

**[18:48]** They have multiple arms.

**[18:50]** I like their kind of bat-like wings.

**[18:53]** Very insectile looking.

**[18:57]** You got four Bayaki in your pool.

**[18:58]** They cost two to summon, and their combat is equal to the number of Bayaki in the battle

**[19:03]** plus one.

**[19:04]** So, one Bayaki by itself, two dice, two Bayaki in the battle, three dice, and so on.

**[19:10]** Bayaki are the most expensive Yellow Sign monster, but that's not saying much because

**[19:16]** the undead only cost one Power themselves.

**[19:18]** The Spellbook that works with the Bayaki is called Shriek of the Bayaki, and it lets you

**[19:23]** move any number of Bayaki to any area on the map.

**[19:28]** This is a pretty useful ability on offense or defense.

**[19:32]** Whenever you need units in an area, it's nice to be able to just call on some Bayaki and

**[19:36]** have them appear no matter how far away they are.

**[19:40]** This kind of scales nicely with the player count as the map areas increase.

**[19:44]** The Bayaki aren't going to have any trouble getting to an important area if you need them

**[19:49]** to be there, assuming they're on the map in the first place.

**[19:54]** The next unit for Yellow Sign, we have our first Great Old One.

**[19:57]** It is the King in Yellow, the Tattered King, the Man in the Pallid Mask.

**[20:04]** He's got a lot of different nicknames.

**[20:06]** I'm looking at the sculpts now.

**[20:08]** It looks like a guy who's pretty stoked about life.

**[20:12]** He's standing atop what looks like a pile of bones.

**[20:16]** Pretty sure that's from the King in Yellow story.

**[20:20]** Similarly to the undead, he's got a lot of tentacles.

**[20:23]** Presumably those are like pastors' tentacles just sort of popping out.

**[20:28]** He's in pretty good shape too. He's got like a... it's pretty ripped. He's got like a six-pack,

**[20:31]** so good for him. How to awaken the king in yellow. You are gonna need to have a

**[20:37]** unit in an area lacking a Gate, so that is a bit strange. And number two, you're

**[20:43]** gonna have to pay four Power and the king will appear in that area. And the

**[20:48]** king has zero combat. So on the awakening cost, kind of weird, but not actually

**[20:56]** very difficult. You just need to move once and you'll be able to awaken the

**[21:00]** king. It's a cheap great old one. It's nice to have a cheap great old one. I'll

**[21:04]** talk more about the benefits of having such a cheap great old one maybe a

**[21:08]** little later in the opening section. The ability on king we really need to get

**[21:13]** into immediately, or the rest of the guide is not gonna make much sense. That

**[21:18]** is Desecrate. It's an action. It costs two. If the king is in an area with no

**[21:23]** desecration token, roll one die and compare to your total units in the area,

**[21:28]** including the king. On a roll equal or less than your unit total, place a

**[21:34]** desecration token in the area. If you succeed or fail, place a monster or

**[21:39]** Cultist with cost two or less in the area. You're gonna need to Desecrate at

**[21:44]** least three times across the map, like I was saying earlier, in these specific

**[21:49]** areas with these glyphs in order to earn all of your books. So you are gonna need

**[21:53]** to move around with the king and get some Desecrates off in order to win. Also

**[21:59]** recall feast. Once we get a desecration token down, that's gonna enable us to

**[22:05]** gain an extra Power every turn, assuming we have a leftover unit in the area, like

**[22:10]** an undead or a buy key or a yellow sign acolyte even. Let's talk about a quick

**[22:18]** rule of thumb for desecrating here. What do you place when you Desecrate? You get

**[22:24]** to place a monster whether you succeed or fail, right? I typically like to place

**[22:29]** the buy key on fails, and that's because you'll be staying in the area likely and

**[22:34]** you'll Desecrate again. And I will place undeads on success, and that's because

**[22:40]** the undead can come with the king when he goes up to move into a new area, if

**[22:44]** that makes sense.

**[22:47]** Occasionally, if you have one in your pool, you might also want to place an

**[22:51]** acolyte on the Desecrate. I would typically do this on like a failed

**[22:55]** Desecrate, maybe toward the end of the action phase when you are about to run

**[22:59]** out of Power. And hopefully you have passion, so if somebody comes around and

**[23:04]** smashes you, you've got that acolyte there to soak up the kill and hopefully

**[23:07]** give you a Power to move to safety or do something else. Once you have Haster

**[23:14]** in play and the third eye, it really gets going because your desecrations are

**[23:19]** going to get reduced by one, and you'll start earning Elder Signs every time

**[23:23]** you're successful. More on that in a second. The Spellbook that works with the

**[23:29]** king in yellow is the Screaming Dead, and this lets you take an additional action

**[23:33]** right after you move the king. It cannot take another Spellbook we'll talk about,

**[23:39]** He Who's Not to be Named, but any other action you can do right after moving. And

**[23:43]** when you do the Screaming Dead, you can bring any amount of undead with you for

**[23:48]** free. If you're ever moving multiple undead the old-fashioned way, you're

**[23:53]** probably doing it wrong or something has gone very wrong. You should be using the

**[23:58]** Screaming Dead to move them around cheaply, if at all possible, though there

**[24:02]** are some exceptions that I will get into later. Bringing those undead along

**[24:08]** with you are going to improve the odds for a successful desecration, so it is

**[24:12]** nice to always have like a group of undead. If you have at least five undead

**[24:17]** and the king moving into an area, that's like a guaranteed successful Desecrate.

**[24:21]** You can only roll, you know, a six at maximum, so if you want to guarantee

**[24:27]** success, roam around with the king and have five undead with you, but you can

**[24:32]** get lucky and be able to be successful a little earlier, too. And let's go on to

**[24:41]** the last unit for Yellow Sign that is Big H himself, Nasty Hasty. It's Hastur.

**[24:49]** He costs ten Power to awaken, very expensive, and his combat is equal to the

**[24:56]** cost of a ritual. Very iconic sculpt here. If anybody's heard of Cthulhu Wars

**[25:03]** before, they've likely seen this one and it probably will stick with them. It's

**[25:07]** very memorable. It's a big face, really big bug eyes, mouth with teeth, some very

**[25:16]** suggestive looking ears, and many tentacles coming out the back and the

**[25:21]** sides. Sort of looks like a bit of like an almost an octopus or a jellyfish

**[25:26]** combined with a face. This one's pretty gross looking, but yeah, it's very

**[25:31]** memorable. My wife and I play Arkham Horror the Card Game. We're playing

**[25:37]** through the Carcosa campaign right now. She has a very lewd nickname for Hastur

**[25:42]** because you're not supposed to say his name in the campaign. I'm not going to

**[25:46]** tell you what the nickname is, but you can probably sort of figure it out based

**[25:50]** on looking at this. Let's go over how to awaken Hastur. You're going to need to

**[25:55]** have a controlled Gate and the king in yellow in the same area, and then you're

**[26:01]** going to have to pay ten Power and Hastur will appear in the king's area.

**[26:06]** Combat for Hastur is equal to the cost of a ritual, so a very typical play

**[26:14]** pattern to awaken Hastur would be... and I'm getting into the openings here, but

**[26:19]** whatever. Move an acolyte, summon the king, build a Gate in action phase one.

**[26:25]** Action phase two, you'll have exactly ten Power and you'll have the king at a Gate

**[26:29]** and summon Hastur. That's like the fastest time that you can do it in. The

**[26:34]** ability on Hastur is vengeance. It's post-battle. If Hastur is involved in a

**[26:39]** battle, choose which combat results are applied to which enemy unit. You

**[26:44]** could apply a kill to a great old one in the battle that's your enemy, for

**[26:49]** example. This is one of the stronger combat abilities in the game. It makes

**[26:54]** Hastur a bit of a rattlesnake. Your opponents are going to really want to

**[26:57]** kill Hastur, but they're going to be very reluctant to do so because it's always

**[27:02]** going to come at a bit of a steep price if they want to make sure he gets killed

**[27:07]** and bring their great old one along. It's very unlikely their great old one is

**[27:11]** going to survive because of vengeance. Vengeance is also one of the ways that

**[27:16]** yellow sign themselves can actually get in on some combats. We'll talk more about

**[27:20]** it later, but you can potentially use this ability to snipe other great

**[27:25]** old ones that might be problematic on the board. The Spellbook that works with

**[27:31]** Hastur is He Who Is Not To Be Named. It's a bit like the Screaming Dead. Choose an

**[27:36]** area with a Cultist and move Hastur there. Then you may take a second action

**[27:41]** that is not the Screaming Dead. So this is like a similar vibe to Screaming Dead,

**[27:46]** but a bit more mobile. Any Cultist anywhere on the map doesn't need to be

**[27:51]** yours, can be an enemy, and you just teleport right over there and you can do

**[27:55]** something else right away. Now we're ready to talk about the Spellbooks for

**[28:01]** yellow sign, so we'll just get into it starting with Passion. Ongoing ability,

**[28:06]** when one or more of your Cultists are eliminated by an enemy, so that's kills,

**[28:11]** captures, anything, gain one Power total. This is an amazing book. I would put this

**[28:17]** in my top picks for best Spellbooks in the game. I think this one easily is in

**[28:22]** the top three, if not the top two or the top one. Yellow sign really doesn't care

**[28:29]** about their acolytes all that much because first of all you have feast,

**[28:33]** second of all you don't even care that much about even controlling that many

**[28:38]** Gates. As long as you're able to get those Desecrates off, you're gonna have

**[28:43]** some amount of Power to do what you need to do. Notably if multiple yellow sign

**[28:49]** acolytes are killed at one time, you're only gonna get one Power. So remember

**[28:54]** that if you have got like three of them in an area and you get completely

**[28:56]** steamrolled in a battle, you're only gonna earn one Power if all those

**[29:00]** acolytes got killed. One reason why I think this is the one of the best

**[29:05]** Spellbooks is it's very nice to have an acolyte in an area where you're

**[29:09]** expecting to get battled and expecting to get a kill rolled against you. You can

**[29:13]** just simply apply that kill to the acolyte and it's like your opponent just

**[29:17]** paid you Power. This can be really nice when you're out of Power and someone

**[29:22]** comes to try to kill one of your great old ones. If you are managing to put the

**[29:27]** kill on your acolyte, you'll pop back in the game with a single Power. You might

**[29:31]** be able to move to safety or reinforce by maybe even recruiting the same

**[29:37]** acolyte over again into the same area. There's another rattlesnake-like ability.

**[29:42]** Your Gates are deceptively difficult to take as yellow sign. If you have multiple

**[29:48]** acolytes on a Gate, unless they get battled away in one action, even

**[29:54]** capturing is gonna be like a little bit more of a pain than normal because

**[29:58]** you'll get a Power each time somebody captures. So people are gonna want to

**[30:02]** battle away your Cultists at one time if possible, but if you've spread them out

**[30:05]** you're gonna get paid as people kill them, as people capture them, and that's

**[30:10]** like a really good thing for you. This is another reason why the feast ability

**[30:14]** unique faction ability is great but not ultimately all that necessary. You're

**[30:19]** gonna be getting so much Power from passion if you use it effectively that

**[30:23]** the feast almost doesn't even matter that much.

**[30:28]** Let's move on to another Spellbook. Third Eye. It's an ongoing ability.

**[30:34]** If Hastur is in play, the cost of desecration is reduced to one.

**[30:38]** If the desecration succeeds, you also get one Elder Sign.

**[30:44]** So this is the win con for Yellow Sign.

**[30:47]** You must get your Spellbook requirements met in order to win, but any desecrating past

**[30:52]** that is hopefully free Elder Signs for you and a really quick doom tempo if your opponents

**[30:58]** are not able to do anything about it.

**[31:01]** This Spellbook is very important to earn.

**[31:04]** I would go as far as saying I don't even bother desecrating the normal way at the two cost.

**[31:09]** I almost always wait until I have the third eye.

**[31:13]** If something goes very wrong, you might have to Desecrate a couple of times at two.

**[31:18]** But yeah, it's very expensive and you don't earn an Elder Sign, so I try to avoid it whenever

**[31:23]** possible.

**[31:24]** That's one mistake I see the very, very new Yellow Sign players make is they get caught

**[31:30]** up in wanting to Desecrate without the third eye.

**[31:34]** It's expensive.

**[31:35]** You're not earning Elder Signs.

**[31:36]** Yes, you might get a couple of Feast Tokens going, but it's just not very efficiently

**[31:41]** costed at two.

**[31:42]** You really do want to have the third eye as soon as you can before you start desecrating.

**[31:49]** Get the third eye so that you can then Desecrate cheaply and then get one of your other Spellbooks

**[31:54]** met that way.

**[31:56]** Don't try to get cute and awake and haster and get something other than third eye.

**[32:01]** Trust me.

**[32:02]** Just get third eye.

**[32:03]** It'll be really happy you did.

**[32:04]** It'll be really awkward if you don't.

**[32:06]** I've seen it happen.

**[32:07]** I've been the one to make it very awkward.

**[32:10]** So don't be like me.

**[32:12]** Don't make that mistake.

**[32:13]** If you wake up haster, probably take the third eye like 99% of the time.

**[32:19]** Yes, of course you can win.

**[32:21]** You can be very successful winning with all the Elder Signs you can accumulate with the

**[32:25]** third eye.

**[32:26]** But as I've said in my politics episode, having a lot of Elder Signs is going to draw a lot

**[32:31]** of attention to you.

**[32:33]** And we're kind of getting into the character arc of every Yellow Sign game where they're

**[32:38]** running around, they're doing their thing, they're earning their Spellbooks, but eventually

**[32:42]** everyone is going to turn their attention to you and be like, we must murder Yellow

**[32:46]** Sign.

**[32:47]** They must be eradicated.

**[32:49]** And Yellow Sign players, Maggie, they sometimes will take it personally when you come after

**[32:55]** them.

**[32:56]** It's not personal.

**[32:57]** Yellow Sign is very strong.

**[32:58]** That's why we're coming after you.

**[33:00]** If you've played any amount of games with anybody that likes to play Yellow Sign, you

**[33:03]** will see this happen.

**[33:05]** They don't like it when everyone decides to come for you.

**[33:09]** I guess what I'm saying is Elder Signs are important from the third eye, but so is the

**[33:13]** raw doom that you get just from controlling Gates.

**[33:16]** And you just want to be careful about overusing the third eye because it's just going to draw

**[33:20]** a lot of heat on you as you play.

**[33:25]** Next Spellbook we have Screaming Dead.

**[33:27]** This is the one that works with the King in Yellow.

**[33:29]** It's a one-cost action.

**[33:31]** Move the King in Yellow to an adjacent area.

**[33:33]** Any undead in the same area can move with him for free.

**[33:36]** You may then take a second, different action.

**[33:39]** You may not take He Who Is Not To Be Named as your second action.

**[33:44]** This is really like the signature Spellbook of Yellow Sign, as I've already said.

**[33:48]** It's really your bread and butter for getting into position and getting off those hopefully

**[33:52]** successful Desecrates and earning your Spellbooks.

**[33:56]** Being able to bring along the undead with you is pretty key because the more you have

**[34:01]** with you, the more units you have in the area, the more likely it is that you're going to

**[34:05]** be successful on desecrating.

**[34:08]** More on this in playing Yellow Sign later, but you really don't want to be spending a

**[34:13]** lot of Power repeatedly desecrating and failing.

**[34:16]** Sometimes it happens.

**[34:17]** If you're like me, it happens.

**[34:18]** But ideally you're desecrating not that many times, and so bringing along the undead is

**[34:24]** really the key to making that happen.

**[34:27]** There's lots of flexibility with the Spellbook too.

**[34:31]** You can always take some of your undead and not all of them, so if you're trying to gain

**[34:37]** some extra Power off of Feast, you really only need five of them at max to go along

**[34:42]** with the king.

**[34:43]** You can always leave one behind into that area you just Desecrated in, and you will

**[34:48]** have a unit in there to earn Power off Feast in the next gather Power step.

**[34:55]** Another thing to remember here, your second action that you take after Screaming Dead,

**[34:59]** it could be a normal move action.

**[35:02]** There's a lot of tricks you can do here.

**[35:04]** First thing would be if the king is isolated, let's say something bad happened, you don't

**[35:10]** have a lot of undead around the king protecting him, you can scream, move into an area, and

**[35:15]** then as your second action move, move the king twice effectively, hopefully get back

**[35:21]** to safety where you have hopefully Hastur, hopefully undead, hopefully some acolytes

**[35:25]** to soak up hits, because you don't want the king getting killed.

**[35:29]** You can't take Hughes Not To Be Named, which we'll talk about in a second, although again

**[35:34]** with that move action, you can effectively move Hastur and keep both your Great Old Ones

**[35:40]** and your undead ball in one big group.

**[35:45]** Sometimes that can be a liability, but a lot of the times that'll be enough to make

**[35:48]** it so that no one's going to mess with you, especially once people have unlimited combat.

**[35:55]** Last thing on Screaming Dead, an important PSA, my first hot take of this episode on

**[36:01]** Yellow Sign, you may take the second action when you use the Screaming Dead, but you do

**[36:05]** not need to.

**[36:07]** I see a lot of players, every time they take Screaming Dead, they will immediately do the

**[36:12]** second action without fail, and typically it will be move and then Desecrate every time.

**[36:19]** That's fine.

**[36:20]** I'm not saying that this is a bad thing to be doing, on the contrary I think it's probably

**[36:24]** one of the best things to be doing, but it is going to draw attention to you over the

**[36:28]** course of the game, accumulating those Elder Signs.

**[36:31]** Also if you are trying to get into those specific areas to Desecrate, you may not want to actually

**[36:38]** be spending the Power to Desecrate at every opportunity.

**[36:43]** It's not a waste, you will get a unit every time, even if you fail a Desecrate, but you

**[36:47]** may not want to Desecrate unsuccessfully more than you need to.

**[36:52]** I like to do this quite a bit of, I just scream, I just move the king in my undead, and I just

**[37:00]** stop right there.

**[37:01]** I've only spent one Power, I moved a bunch of units, I have that one Power that I was

**[37:06]** planning to do for that second action, I can do it later, or I can spend it on something

**[37:10]** else.

**[37:11]** This is just that concept of staggering your Power spending coming into play.

**[37:16]** Sometimes you want to do both at once, of course I'm not saying don't do this, I am

**[37:20]** just saying think twice, slowly spend your Power instead of doing it all at once.

**[37:29]** Moving on to another Spellbook, we have He Who Is Not To Be Named.

**[37:34]** It's a one cost action, move Hastur into any area containing a Cultist of any faction.

**[37:39]** You may then take a second different action, it cannot be the Screaming Dead.

**[37:45]** So same PSA as Screaming Dead, you do not need to spend the Power on a second action

**[37:51]** if you don't want to.

**[37:54]** This ability makes Hastur very very mobile, but you gotta be careful because you do not

**[38:00]** want to lose Hastur in a random skirmish with some monsters, you don't want to lose

**[38:04]** him without good reason because he's very expensive to reawaken, and with the next Spellbook

**[38:10]** you'll understand why we want to keep Hastur alive at all times.

**[38:16]** Remember the Vengeance ability that can also be a nice way to move and then battle as your

**[38:20]** second action is a great way to snipe, and we'll talk more about the ultimate sniping

**[38:27]** The Hastur hit squad, we'll talk a bit more about that in the Playing Yellow Sign portion

**[38:31]** of the guide.

**[38:35]** Let's move on to the next Spellbook, that's Zingaya.

**[38:38]** It's a one cost action, if undead are in an area with enemy acolyte Cultists, transform

**[38:45]** one such acolyte into an undead.

**[38:49]** So interesting Spellbook, a little bit like Dreams, but it doesn't replace with an acolyte,

**[38:55]** it just kind of turns them into an undead.

**[38:58]** This is very useful for the occasional enemy Gate that has a monster and one acolyte, approximately

**[39:03]** one acolyte just hanging out.

**[39:05]** If you move an undead in there, maybe you have an acolyte in your pool for some reason,

**[39:10]** you can just Zingaya them and then have an acolyte there and you're right on the Gate

**[39:15]** right away.

**[39:16]** Great way to take Gates from people when they're close to out of Power or out of Power altogether.

**[39:23]** I think this is a criminally underrated Spellbook, I don't see it used that often, but it can

**[39:30]** be extremely, extremely strong when used in the right way.

**[39:35]** I'll talk more about this one when we get into Playing Yellow Sign, but do not sleep

**[39:39]** on this one.

**[39:40]** I see a lot of players play without ever using Zingaya and I think it's a bit of a mistake

**[39:45]** because of how much potential there is for shenanigans here.

**[39:51]** One other callout on this one is it's enemy acolyte Cultists, so remember if the cats

**[39:56]** are in the game, this ability can target earth cats, so if cats are being annoying to you,

**[40:02]** just start turning their cats into undead, they'll be really sad that you're doing

**[40:06]** that to them.

**[40:07]** They kind of deserve it, why are they picking on you anyway, right?

**[40:14]** The last Spellbook we have for Yellow Sign is the Shriek of the Baiki.

**[40:19]** Shriek of the Baiki is a one-cost action, move any or all baiki from their current areas

**[40:25]** to one selected area regardless of distance.

**[40:30]** Very nice movement ability here, doesn't matter how far away you are, you just start showing

**[40:35]** up.

**[40:37]** As the map scales and there are more areas, it's nice to be able to completely disregard

**[40:42]** how far away you are and just show up as needed.

**[40:45]** It's going to be a fun Spellbook.

**[40:46]** be a great way to put some bodies in the way to protect the king in yellow and

**[40:49]** Haster as necessary. It can also be used offensively along with Haster's vengeance

**[40:56]** once you get unlimited combat, and the he is not to be named Spellbook. We'll talk

**[41:01]** more about that in one second. I think we've got all of the Spellbooks out of

**[41:07]** the way and we can get into openings with yellow sign and then we can get

**[41:12]** into playing yellow sign and thwarting yellow sign. Starting with the openings,

**[41:18]** the most common opening is move an acolyte into a new area, awaken the king

**[41:24]** and build a Gate. I would suggest Arabia is a very good place to do this on earth.

**[41:30]** Why? It's because Arabia has that claw scratching glyph symbol and next door is

**[41:37]** West and East Africa where you've got the chevron symbol so I can set you up

**[41:42]** to like Desecrate right next door and earn a couple of Spellbooks. This is the

**[41:47]** most standard opening. It's going to set you up for the action phase to Haster

**[41:51]** which is obviously ideal, getting Haster out as early as possible. This is good

**[41:56]** for you, objectively is good for you, but if you're playing with good and savvy

**[42:01]** players they're going to be having their eye on you right away. They're going to be

**[42:05]** watching for you to start that train of just like moving and desecrating over

**[42:09]** and over again and start raking in those Elder Signs. Just know good players are

**[42:13]** going to be watching you right off the bat if you do this. In action phase 3

**[42:20]** you'll have Haster, you'll have 10 Power. I would then, you know, when you awaken

**[42:26]** Haster in action phase 2 or 3, take the third eye. Then you can feel free to

**[42:32]** Desecrate in that area where you have King and Haster. You'll get your Spellbook.

**[42:36]** From there you'll just be going on that journey as the king and start moving

**[42:43]** hopefully into East Africa and then cross the pond to the Americas to get

**[42:48]** the rest of your Desecrate Spellbooks. The other opening I am very excited to

**[42:55]** talk about. This is like another hot take of mine. Try this and tell me it's not

**[43:00]** amazing. The three Gate opening for yellow sign is fully a thing. You have my

**[43:05]** full endorsement of this opening. I go for it almost every time I play yellow

**[43:10]** sign. You can fake people out and kind of do this in a particular order, make people

**[43:15]** think you're going for that standard opening, but it's moving an acolyte,

**[43:20]** moving an acolyte again, give that three doom away to whoever, you don't really

**[43:26]** care, and you take passion, okay? Then you start constructing your Gates. You're

**[43:32]** adjacent to your Europe start area in, you know, two different ways. So the reason I

**[43:40]** fully endorse this opening is because you basically can't be stopped except by

**[43:45]** like the cats or like a really dedicated crawling chaos player. Even if somebody

**[43:50]** moves and captures you because you have passion and because you have some

**[43:54]** acolytes next door, you'll just give you the Power to move another acolyte onto

**[43:59]** the Gate. So you'll need to be captured like multiple times in order to be

**[44:03]** stopped from like really getting those three Gates and three raw doom

**[44:08]** importantly. But ideally nobody is near you. Maybe you're in a situation where

**[44:14]** crawling chaos isn't in the game. If you're able to just do this, obviously

**[44:18]** the three Gate opening is amazing. You have the 12 Power next turn and you can

**[44:24]** do all kinds of shenanigans. This is like my, I'm just getting into my preferred way

**[44:29]** of playing Yellow Sign at this point. You go for the three Gate opening and then

**[44:33]** the next action phase you move once into wherever and do your king awakening

**[44:39]** which is like typical to do in the previous action phase. From there you

**[44:45]** should have like seven Power. You could build a fourth Gate, move and capture and

**[44:50]** get up to like five Gates. That's why I like this opening. It's very easy to like

**[44:56]** get the king, have five Gates so by the time you get to action phase three you

**[45:02]** just have 15 Power. Of course you can get Haster out great and then you still have

**[45:07]** five Power to play with. And because you have passion, like I said earlier, getting

**[45:12]** those Yellow Sign acolytes into areas where you think you're gonna get battle

**[45:16]** is really nice. You're almost not unhappy in action phase three and beyond for

**[45:21]** players to like start trying to tear you off those Gates. That's totally fine

**[45:26]** because they're paying you Power in the process and importantly they're putting

**[45:30]** the acolytes back into your pool. This is one of the drawbacks of like this

**[45:35]** typical Yellow Sign play of like just moving and dust creating the whole time.

**[45:39]** Your acolytes are awkwardly in Europe and you do kind of want to like get them

**[45:44]** into your pool so you can like redeploy them elsewhere later. And speaking of

**[45:50]** drawbacks, I've been saying a lot of good things about this opening but it's

**[45:53]** definitely not without risk itself. Not for the faint of heart. If you like

**[45:58]** playing with Haster, if you're worried about the king being by themselves, maybe

**[46:03]** don't go for this one. You'll be doing just fine by going for that standard

**[46:06]** opening. With this three Gate opening you're trading your speed of getting

**[46:11]** your Spellbooks in exchange for being disruptive to the other players.

**[46:16]** Something I value really highly. People are going to be taking off action phase

**[46:21]** two a lot of the time to awaken their great old ones. You're counting on that

**[46:24]** if you're going for this opening so that you can just run around with the king

**[46:28]** and do all kinds of shenanigans. Even though the king has zero combat it is

**[46:33]** still a great old one and that status alone makes it very very valuable early

**[46:37]** on, especially if players don't have Power. You can just freely walk over,

**[46:41]** capture wherever you want. That's why it makes it so much easier to claim those

**[46:45]** additional Gates. The main trade-off here, you're giving up on the speed, you're

**[46:52]** giving up on getting a lot of the Elder Signs, and you're just kind of

**[46:56]** substituting them for the raw doom that you will get for having three

**[47:01]** Gates in action phase two, probably five Gates in action phase three, and

**[47:06]** hopefully maintaining some steady flow of Gates from then on. That will keep you

**[47:11]** competitive in terms of doom and eventually you can transition out of

**[47:16]** this and into that more typical move and Desecrate as many times as

**[47:20]** necessary to get the rest of the Elder Signs you need to close out the game.

**[47:24]** The big risk here, the big drawback, is you're getting your books a lot more

**[47:30]** slowly. You may not be desecrating until action phase four, getting your first

**[47:34]** Desecrate book, that's really really slow. If some other faction in the game like

**[47:39]** Great Cthulhu is there and they're doing their thing on time, they might have

**[47:44]** unlimited combat by the time action phase four rolls around. If they look

**[47:48]** like they're gonna get to that point, you're in big trouble and you should

**[47:51]** probably abandon ship, try to get Hastur out as early as possible, and be

**[47:56]** defensive because they will punish you for going for this opening.

**[48:03]** Once you're at that point with Yellow Sign that you've awoken

**[48:07]** your Great Old Ones and now you have a little bit of Power to move around, I

**[48:10]** would aim to get like one or two of those Desecrate Spellbooks met in an

**[48:15]** action phase. You can do all three but it's not a guarantee, so two out of three

**[48:21]** is okay. What you really want to do is try to get them before other factions

**[48:27]** get unlimited combat, and that's because it's gonna make it a little bit more

**[48:31]** difficult for you to move around with your king and yellow ball. If you do

**[48:38]** need to take a break between action phases and earning all of your Desecrate

**[48:42]** books, the North Atlantic is a pretty nice place to be stopped in. Hopefully

**[48:46]** nobody's there to punch you, but it is super connected to the other

**[48:50]** areas on the map and that can be a good place to post up at the end of the

**[48:54]** action phase. You're adjacent to a lot of the areas, all of the areas that you need

**[48:59]** to reach for your Spellbook requirements. However, like I said, super

**[49:03]** connected. Many other factions are also interested in this area for various

**[49:06]** reasons, so you've been warned. So I've kind of already started going into

**[49:14]** playing Yellow Sign, but we'll just move into this portion of the guide proper. As

**[49:20]** long as you have Power as this faction, your Great Old Ones are pretty much

**[49:24]** untouchable as long as the other players don't have unlimited combat, that's key.

**[49:29]** And that's because you're pretty much always going to be able to scream away,

**[49:32]** or he who's not to be named, to get to safety and get out of danger. You could

**[49:38]** he who's not to be named and then shriek of the Bayaki as your second action to

**[49:42]** like move faster, surround faster with Bayakis. That's gonna be really nice.

**[49:49]** Once people have unlimited combat, you're gonna have to be a lot more careful

**[49:52]** about moving around with your Great Old Ones. You're gonna need to have both your

**[49:58]** Great Old Ones in play to really take advantage of this Elder Sign engine, so

**[50:02]** losing either one of them sucks. I would say losing Hester is worse because he

**[50:07]** costs more, but make no mistake, it's an inconvenience to lose the king as well.

**[50:12]** Losing one at the wrong time can really cost you the game, so be really mindful

**[50:17]** of other factions when they might get unlimited combat, and be very safe and

**[50:23]** careful once they do. Typical thing to do would be screaming dead and then move

**[50:29]** Hester as the second action, keeping one big ball of units. If your opponent wants

**[50:34]** to fight you, they're gonna have to deal with vengeance and they're gonna have to

**[50:38]** deal with possibly losing their Great Old One. It gets a lot more sketchy to

**[50:43]** move around with Yellow Sign and earn your books once someone gets unlimited

**[50:46]** combat, so try to be one of the first people that do that if you can.

**[50:51]** If you are accumulating a lot of Elder Signs, definitely take advantage of the fact that you can.

**[50:57]** strategically reveal Elder Signs before the end of the game. If you have a bunch

**[51:02]** of ones, like actual three ones and nothing else, I would just show them off.

**[51:06]** Just psychologically, not having any face down Elder Signs will kind of alleviate

**[51:11]** some of that heat that you'll attract by just piling up Elder Signs. Once you have

**[51:19]** all those deathscreens folks met, I would not be afraid at all to ritual, even on

**[51:23]** one to two Gates, because you do have those two great old ones, you're gonna be

**[51:27]** getting multiple Elder Signs from a ritual that way. You can easily get four

**[51:32]** to six doom this way, and that's not an insignificant amount. And along with your

**[51:36]** feast, yeah you might be like paying for some of that ritual, and if you are

**[51:41]** sitting on a pile of Elder Signs, this will close out the game very fast. Don't

**[51:45]** ritual until you've met all of your Spellbooks, but once you've done those

**[51:49]** dust crate ones, let it rip because you can close out the game really quickly.

**[51:56]** Next thing to talk about on playing Yellow Sign would be this concept of

**[52:01]** Haster hit squad, which I mentioned earlier. This is a really nice way to

**[52:05]** pick off valuable units and really gets going once you have unlimited combat.

**[52:11]** Picture this, you have Haster, you have unlimited combat, you have hopefully

**[52:17]** three or four Bayeki on the map. Hopefully as a group you'll have

**[52:21]** between nine and twelve dice. So you use He Who's Not To Be Named, go into an area

**[52:26]** with the Cultists, there's a great old one there you're hoping to snipe, right?

**[52:29]** Your second action with He Who's Not To Be Named is Shriek of the Bayeki, so you

**[52:34]** bring all of your Bayeki into the area. Then you have unlimited combat, so

**[52:38]** you pay three Power doing all these things, and then you fight. And you should

**[52:43]** hopefully be able to roll one or two kills and eliminate that high-value

**[52:47]** target if needed. With the right faction composition, I think if you start the

**[52:53]** action phase on like 12 Power, you can actually really suppress the other

**[52:58]** factions nicely with this hit squad style of play. If you can snipe Narlathotep

**[53:04]** and others that can threaten you in combat, you can really be free afterward

**[53:10]** to do whatever you want and win the game. Outside of the pastor hit squad, I

**[53:17]** would be trying to avoid fights with Yellow Sign generally, because you just

**[53:21]** don't have the dice to win the straight-up battles. The last part of

**[53:28]** playing Yellow Sign is dealing with your great old ones getting eliminated, because

**[53:33]** this will happen against good players. Just be very careful about when you try

**[53:38]** to reawaken and try to engineer the right composition of units and area to

**[53:44]** reawaken in, if that makes any sense. Good players are gonna try to keep you down

**[53:49]** by predicting where you'll be and when you'll be there. Great place to try to

**[53:56]** reawaken either of your great old ones would be where you have an acolyte, and

**[54:00]** that's just this notion of passion always paying you back a little bit.

**[54:04]** Even if somebody comes after you again right away, hopefully you can soak up one

**[54:09]** kill on one of your acolytes and get a Power back, and hopefully your great old

**[54:12]** one survives. Last kind of hot take strategy here for Yellow Sign, let's say

**[54:19]** you're playing with really good players, they totally have your great old

**[54:24]** ones on lockdown, you've been sniped multiple times, you just don't have the

**[54:29]** Power in order to reawaken them again. Reawakening Hester is just not

**[54:34]** feasible because you will have spent all of your Power doing that, you can't do

**[54:38]** anything else. I'm gonna call this strategy the skeleton crew. Hopefully

**[54:44]** you're only running into this problem if you're doing this mass Elder Sign

**[54:48]** strategy, but let's say you've got several areas feasted, there's Desecrated

**[54:53]** tokens there, I mean, and your great old ones get killed. You've got, you know, eight

**[54:59]** or nine Power, not really enough to do much with your great old ones if you

**[55:03]** reawaken, so this is where I would suggest using your undead to try to

**[55:09]** limp to victory alongside passion. More than likely you will have Desecrated in an

**[55:15]** area with a Gate, so this is where you've got a great opportunity to take

**[55:20]** these really efficient one-cost actions over and over. Summoning the undead,

**[55:25]** recruiting an acolyte, moving, those are all one-cost actions you can slowly spend

**[55:30]** your Power, right? What you want to do is get your acolytes into an area with a

**[55:35]** Gate, hopefully you can summon an undead. You can start using those cheap undead

**[55:40]** to move around and hopefully claim Gates by using Zyngaia. More than likely you

**[55:45]** don't have a lot of undead as well if you got king wiped off the map. The idea

**[55:49]** is use your Zyngaia to cheaply claim Gates and take those one-cost actions

**[55:55]** and try to end the action phase with a couple of Gates and hopefully some

**[56:01]** Power left from feast in order to have enough Power to ritual. Again you went

**[56:06]** for this mass Elder Sign strategy, you're probably on like 20-ish doom here and

**[56:12]** hopefully you can use that skeleton crew strategy to like claw your way to

**[56:18]** victory, get those last few doom points. Hopefully you have enough to ritual,

**[56:23]** maybe you can earn two doom plus two more from a ritual and close out the

**[56:27]** game. Skeleton crew, certainly not your plan A or even your plan B, but something

**[56:34]** very much to keep in mind. Don't despair, that's another common trait among

**[56:39]** yellow sign players. They're very salty and sad once this has happened and their

**[56:44]** great ones are completely taken care of. They're considering themselves out of

**[56:47]** the game. I'm telling you now, you are very much not. Keep a low profile, move

**[56:53]** those undead into position, get those Zyngaia off, recruit those acolytes and

**[56:57]** you might be able to get a couple more Gates for your trouble and actually

**[57:01]** still be able to win even without your great old ones. The last section here

**[57:07]** would be on thwarting yellow sign. It's pretty simple, I've already talked about

**[57:11]** it quite a bit. Killing the great old ones is the name of the game, so any

**[57:15]** opportunity you have to do this you should take. You should be discussing

**[57:19]** with the other players when to try to snipe the great old ones and which ones.

**[57:25]** Hastur is going to be able to inflict some damage on you in a fight, but still

**[57:29]** is worth doing as it's going to shut down the Elder Signs from desecrating

**[57:34]** with the third eye Spellbook. So if you have like a Cthulhu in the game or some

**[57:38]** other cheap great old one or units that can roll a lot of dice, I would go after

**[57:43]** Hastur first. If you don't have unlimited combat, don't even bother going after the

**[57:49]** yellow sign great old ones because they're just going to be able to sidestep

**[57:51]** you every single time. Not worth wasting your Power doing. I would wait until

**[57:56]** ideally you have unlimited combat yourself, then you can just show up,

**[57:59]** declare a battle, ruin their day. The other thing would be they're going for

**[58:06]** this mass Desecrate strategy, limit the number of Gates that yellow sign has.

**[58:10]** That's going to really pamper the amount of Power they have to work with. Even if

**[58:16]** they're sitting on a pile of Elder Signs and there's many Desecrate tokens around,

**[58:19]** if you can manage to keep them on like one Gate or no Gates, they won't be

**[58:25]** gaining that much doom naturally and the rituals won't be as effective. Keep them

**[58:30]** down on Gates, that's going to limit the Power they have to just like parade

**[58:33]** around the map and do that Desecrate dance that they want to do. Don't ever

**[58:38]** let yellow sign be on like more than two Gates, you're gonna have a big

**[58:42]** problem if you do. And I think we're right at the end of the episode so I'll

**[58:48]** just give you my closing thoughts. Like I said at the top, it took me a long time,

**[58:54]** years I would say, to come around on this faction but it's really grown on me and

**[58:58]** I love playing this faction now. Hopefully you've learned a bit of some

**[59:02]** tricks, notably that style of mass Gates and minimal desecration. I really really

**[59:09]** really am evangelizing that because I've played to great effect almost every time

**[59:14]** I play yellow sign and I think if your group is used to that other typical

**[59:20]** style, you will catch them off guard real bad by totally flipping the script on

**[59:25]** them and barely desecrating at all. I promise you you will catch people by

**[59:29]** surprise if you go for this other style. The value of just juking people and

**[59:35]** head faking people is very good in Cthulhu Wars so I would just encourage

**[59:39]** you if you consider yourself a yellow sign main, try this other style, see how

**[59:44]** it works for you, try to like blend these styles together and I think then you'll

**[59:48]** be reaching your full potential and your yellow belt if you will playing this

**[59:53]** faction. There's a big bag of tricks here and they aren't often put into practice

**[59:59]** so test people's knowledge in the game, see how they react when you start doing

**[01:00:04]** some weird stuff, go for these Zengaia plays, be careful about how you

**[01:00:08]** sequence your spell books so that nothing awkward happens, and see how it

**[01:00:12]** goes. Be a better yellow sign player and experiment a little bit and I think that

**[01:00:16]** you'll be glad that you did. And that's another episode in the book so thank you

**[01:00:22]** very much for listening. Please rate, review, and subscribe if you can. You can
