## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:24]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host. Hope you're doing well. I'm recording this over Memorial Day weekend, a little bit later in the day than I would normally record, so I don't have that low, sexy, berry-white tone that I normally have at the start of every episode.

**[00:41]** In the middle of a three-day weekend, I'm really glad to not be working and get a break. My work's been very stressful lately. I hope wherever you all are, you're also able to get a break from whatever you're doing, because it feels good to rest and recharge a little bit.

**[00:58]** I've been doing a lot of resting, so I am ready to hop back on and record another episode.

**[01:04]** Today, we are talking about the Independent Great Old One Pack 2. This is another neutral expansion. It's got four more neutral Great Old Ones that you can add to your games.

**[01:17]** Let's just jump right into it. The first Great Old One we have is Atlachnatcha, sometimes called the Spinner in Darkness. Arkham Horror fans know what I'm talking about with that one.

**[01:31]** This one is another deep cut from that Clark Ashton Smith story we mentioned in another episode, The Seven Gayishes. Not a long story, but does do a lot of name-dropping.

**[01:44]** Spinner in Darkness is what it sounds like. It is a big, nasty spider god. I'm looking at the sculpt now. Kind of a beetle-y looking body, just a really gross, fat spider body.

**[01:57]** It's big enough to, you know, frighten anybody that's afraid of spiders, but if you look really closely, oof, that's where it gets really creepy. It's like five different human faces. They all seem like they're pretty upset, and then there's a nasty spider mouth to go with it. Very gross.

**[02:15]** How to Awaken Atlachnatcha. Cost six to awaken. Your controlled Gate is in an area with your Great Old One. Pay six Power, place Atlachnatcha in the area containing the Gate.

**[02:25]** Atlachnatcha has four combat, and the ability is Spinnerettes. It's a one-cost action. If Atlachnatcha is in an area that is lacking a web token, place one there.

**[02:39]** Hey, weird. What are web tokens? They don't do anything by themselves.

**[02:43]** Okay.

**[02:44]** The Spellbook requirement for Atlachnatcha. Web tokens are in six different areas.

**[02:50]** So we'll need to lay down six webs.

**[02:54]** And the Spellbook for Atlachnatcha is Cosmic Web.

**[02:58]** It's a zero-cost action. Immediately win the game, even if you have fewer than six faction Spellbooks.

**[03:04]** So assuming you're able to meet that requirement, six webs in six different areas, and you're able to get to your turn with Atlachnatcha still under your control,

**[03:17]** you can pay a zero and immediately win the game.

**[03:20]** So this is a very spicy Great Old One, I would say, because it's just another win condition that's in the game.

**[03:28]** I wouldn't say this is easy to do, necessarily.

**[03:32]** You're going to spend six Power on webs. You're also going to have to move around.

**[03:35]** So I think spending 12 Power to win this way seems like that's asking a bit.

**[03:40]** I've played with this one a couple of times, and what actually tends to happen is it doesn't usually go down like that.

**[03:48]** Like, one person's not, like, moving six times and laying down all the webs.

**[03:52]** It usually tends to go, somebody gets three or four webs down, everybody else is now watching for the alternate win condition happening,

**[04:01]** and they will go hunt for Atlachnatcha.

**[04:05]** Atlachnatcha gets killed.

**[04:06]** Somebody else buys Atlachnatcha and then continue where the other player left off because the webs don't go away.

**[04:13]** When you lose your Great Old One, you lose a loyalty card, a Spellbook falls off, but you don't lose any tokens.

**[04:19]** The webs stay, so the next person to own Atlachnatcha already has a head start getting to that point of six webs and winning the game.

**[04:28]** So you could say this is a fun or maybe not fun Great Old One, depending on who you ask.

**[04:34]** I actually think the alternate win cons are pretty entertaining and interesting.

**[04:39]** I especially like this one, and I've been meaning to try it again sometime.

**[04:43]** I've played with this one on the Dreamlands map, which itself has an alternate win condition, so there's now three different ways to win the game.

**[04:51]** I like trying to see what kind of chaos that this will introduce into a game,

**[04:55]** but understandable if players don't want to play with something like this because they do want to just win the traditional way by getting to 30 Doom.

**[05:03]** Totally understand that, but if you've never tried this one, I would definitely give it a go because it's quite fun.

**[05:11]** What factions like Atlachnatcha?

**[05:13]** I would say this Great Old One is best in some sort of a death ball scenario.

**[05:17]** I think Windwalker probably can make the best use of Atlachnatcha because you can always be roaming around with that Windwalker death ball

**[05:24]** and making sure Atlachnatcha is safe as you slowly lay down those webs.

**[05:30]** In addition to any hibernating you might be doing, you might have an abundance of Power from hibernating.

**[05:36]** That should make it much, much easier to actually move around as much as you need to lay down all those webs.

**[05:41]** Any faction with a way to save on movement I think is going to especially be interested in the Spider God, the Spinner in Darkness.

**[05:54]** Now we will move on to our next Great Old One.

**[05:57]** This is Bo Krug, the Great Water Lizard.

**[06:02]** Sculpt looks pretty cool.

**[06:04]** Actually looks pretty tame compared to a lot of Cthulhu War sculpts, although, you know, I take that back.

**[06:10]** I'm looking more closely. It's a little bit more gross than it appears.

**[06:15]** It looks kind of just like more of a typical, like, prehistoric lizard dragon looking thing.

**[06:23]** But I'm looking closely on the neck.

**[06:24]** I'm noticing the neck is actually itself like a very large gaping mouth.

**[06:29]** So that's kind of cool, though.

**[06:30]** Definitely gives it a little extra layer of creepiness upon closer inspection.

**[06:36]** How to Awaken Bo Krug.

**[06:38]** Cost 4.

**[06:40]** Your controlled Gate is in an area with your Great Old One.

**[06:42]** Pay 6 Power and you place Bo Krug at an area containing the Gate.

**[06:47]** And Bo Krug only has a single combat dice.

**[06:51]** The ability on Bo Krug is Ghost of Ib.

**[06:54]** An ongoing ability.

**[06:56]** If Bo Krug is killed, you do not lose this loyalty card.

**[07:00]** Instead, place Bo Krug's figure on this card.

**[07:02]** At the end of the next Doom phase, return Bo Krug to any area of the map that does not contain any enemy units.

**[07:09]** If there's no such areas, Bo Krug remains on this card until the next Doom phase.

**[07:15]** So if Bo Krug gets killed, it won't really die, but it will just return at the end of the Doom phase.

**[07:20]** Spellbook requirement is very interesting and will inform the rest of this one.

**[07:27]** Spellbook requirement.

**[07:28]** Take this loyalty card and give it to a player of your choice.

**[07:31]** That player then places Bo Krug's Spellbook on this card.

**[07:35]** And the Spellbook that works with this is called the Doom that Came to Sarnath.

**[07:40]** It's a Doom phase ability.

**[07:41]** At the end of the Doom phase, select an enemy and one of these two options.

**[07:46]** Your enemy chooses a monster or Cultist of yours to eliminate, or they choose one of your Elder Signs to discard.

**[07:54]** Wow, so this is a very unique Great Old One.

**[07:58]** This is a poison pill that can be passed around between the players at the table.

**[08:02]** I've read the abilities.

**[08:04]** Let me just lay out for you how this actually works, because it is a little bit to take in.

**[08:08]** I had to reread this one several times before I really grasped what was going on here.

**[08:14]** First thing, the first player in the game who buys Bo Krug, they will get it at their Gate.

**[08:20]** They'll have a 1 combat Great Old One, which is still good enough for protecting Gate from other monsters.

**[08:28]** This could be a very under-defended Gate, and you could just be threatening to give Bo Krug's loyalty card to anybody that comes after your Gate.

**[08:35]** This is a very interesting rattlesnake kind of Great Old One here to keep people away from your space.

**[08:43]** With Ghost of Ib, if you get Bo Krug killed at the end of the next Doom phase, return Bo Krug to any area of the map that does not contain enemy units.

**[08:52]** So, you could even return Bo Krug back to another area with your units.

**[08:59]** It just says, no enemy units.

**[09:01]** If you want to maintain control of Bo Krug, have it come back every Doom phase, you could just have it return to an area where your Gates are.

**[09:11]** But, if you want to give this one away, put it where there's an area that there's nothing there, that it's totally remote and removed from everything else.

**[09:20]** That would be the way to hurt the player that you want to give this to the most.

**[09:24]** You can gain your Doom to Sarnath Spellbook, and you'll give it away to another player.

**[09:32]** That player, in turn, their job now is to get Bo Krug killed.

**[09:37]** Otherwise, at the end of every Doom phase, they are going to be getting hit with that Doom to Sarnath.

**[09:42]** This Spellbook ability is actually pretty painful.

**[09:48]** I think most of the time you're going to want to choose the first option.

**[09:52]** So, you choose an enemy, and you choose one of the options.

**[09:56]** You're probably going to choose option 1, which is your enemy chooses a monster or Cultist of yours to eliminate.

**[10:02]** This is still pretty painful, because the enemy does get to choose.

**[10:06]** So, if you were thinking, like, oh, I'll play Yellow Sign, I'll eliminate a Cultist so that I get a Power from passion.

**[10:13]** Your enemy is actually the one that's going to pick, so you're never really going to be able to do that unless you get cooperation from somebody else.

**[10:20]** The Elder Sign ability is a lot more harsh.

**[10:23]** I can see why you would want to opt for this if you have an important monster or something you want to preserve,

**[10:28]** like maybe a Formless Spawn, or a Spawn of Yogg, or a Demon Salt and Larva.

**[10:34]** If you choose to lose an Elder Sign, you're not even really going to be able to, like, throw away your 1s.

**[10:39]** The opponent gets to choose which of your face-down Elder Signs to discard, so

**[10:42]** essentially they're picking randomly, and you might be losing multiple Doom on this.

**[10:46]** I don't like that one bit.

**[10:48]** I would rather only lose, if I can guarantee I'm losing only one Doom, okay.

**[10:53]** But if somebody is, like, taking your 2 or your 3, that's just so painful.

**[10:57]** So, you're on the receiving end of this, and you want the Doom of Sarnath to stop.

**[11:01]** You want to, like, avoid that from going on.

**[11:03]** What do you do?

**[11:05]** If your independent Great Old One is killed, plays its loyalty card.

**[11:09]** Figure unused tokens and Spellbook back into the pool.

**[11:12]** If you've earned this Spellbook, it falls off the loyalty card and is no longer in effect.

**[11:17]** That is the key sentence there.

**[11:19]** Ghost of Ib does not prevent you from losing the loyalty card, and Bokrug doesn't go back to the pool.

**[11:24]** Bokrug goes onto the loyalty card, but the Spellbook still falls off.

**[11:27]** So, at that point, the player who has control of Bokrug waits until the end of the Doom phase.

**[11:33]** They stick it somewhere else, and at that point, they can, in turn, choose to Doom of Sarnath.

**[11:38]** Somebody else, including you, the player that gave it to them.

**[11:40]** So, yeah, this is a very weird Great Old One.

**[11:43]** Lots of, like, social things at play.

**[11:45]** I'm not sure if I've even covered them all, but you're having this mean thing that's happening to you,

**[11:50]** but once you stop it from happening to you, I really do think this is a nice rattlesnake-style Great Old One to keep a Gate safe.

**[11:59]** You can really threaten to use this Spellbook on people, so I like that a lot.

**[12:03]** Which factions like it?

**[12:05]** It's maybe easier to say which factions don't like it.

**[12:07]** Really, none of them.

**[12:09]** You're going to always be trying to give your opponent the thing that affects you the least,

**[12:13]** and I'm thinking that's going to be eliminating a monster or Cultist, but you've got to be careful.

**[12:18]** You really don't want your 3-cost Formless Spawn or your 4-cost Spawn of Yaw getting sniped from this.

**[12:24]** That feels bad.

**[12:25]** I think I've played a single game with Bokrug, so I'd like to see it in play again.

**[12:30]** I do like this one quite a bit.

**[12:33]** It's just an interesting take on the Great Old Ones.

**[12:35]** Like, instead of something that's just helping you, it's something to hurt your opponents,

**[12:39]** and it's getting passed around the whole game.

**[12:42]** Lastly, on Bokrug, what's up with the name of the ability, Ghosts of Ib,

**[12:47]** and the Spellbook, The Doom That Came to Sarnath?

**[12:50]** This is really, really cool.

**[12:51]** This is based on the H.P. Lovecast story of the same name, The Doom That Came to Sarnath.

**[12:57]** Quick summary of that story.

**[12:59]** Essentially, there's an idol of Bokrug that is just kind of there at the rise and fall of all these different empires.

**[13:06]** Like, there's a period of prosperity, and there's a war and bad things happen.

**[13:10]** This society is completely wiped out.

**[13:12]** That idol of Bokrug is just still there, still hanging around.

**[13:17]** This is one of my favorite things about Cthulhu Wars, right?

**[13:19]** Sandy, others, clearly read the story, Doom That Came to Sarnath, and thought,

**[13:24]** how do I make that story into a unit in Cthulhu Wars that players can use?

**[13:30]** Very, very cool.

**[13:32]** I think this is a great way to design your games.

**[13:35]** Find a story, find a thing.

**[13:37]** How do I translate that into the game?

**[13:38]** I think this is very, very cool.

**[13:40]** On to our next great old one, we have Father Dagon.

**[13:46]** Father Dagon is from the story Dagon by HP Lovecraft.

**[13:52]** Think mega Deep One.

**[13:55]** A Deep One that other Deep Ones look up to.

**[13:58]** It's kind of what's going on here.

**[14:00]** I'm looking at this sculpt.

**[14:01]** It looks a bit like a spooky, maybe plesiosaur kind of body looking thing.

**[14:08]** It doesn't really look very frog-like the way the other Deep Ones do.

**[14:12]** There's some kind of weird tail thing, tentacle thing coming out the back.

**[14:16]** It is like a business up front party in the back situation.

**[14:19]** Not really sure what's going on with that, but it does look aquatic.

**[14:22]** It does look pretty mean.

**[14:23]** Looks like it could mess you up.

**[14:24]** How to awaken Father Dagon.

**[14:29]** Cost four.

**[14:30]** Your controlled Gate is in an area with your great old one.

**[14:33]** You'll pay four Power, and you'll place Father Dagon in the area containing the Gate.

**[14:38]** Combat is two on land, and six if you're in an ocean area.

**[14:43]** It's another aquatic-based great old one.

**[14:46]** The ability for Dagon.

**[14:49]** Tsunami.

**[14:50]** It's a one-cost action.

**[14:51]** Choose a land area adjacent to an ocean area.

**[14:54]** All Cultists in the area must be moved into adjacent ocean areas by their owners.

**[15:00]** This includes your Cultists.

**[15:02]** In a dispute over who moves first, you decide.

**[15:05]** This is a cool, kind of similar mirror to the Mama Hydra ability.

**[15:11]** Her ability can push Cultists out of ocean areas.

**[15:14]** Dagon's ability can pull them into the water, which is pretty nice.

**[15:19]** Go into the water, live there, die there.

**[15:22]** Death clock fans know what I'm talking about.

**[15:26]** So this is an interesting ability.

**[15:28]** It doesn't seem super useful at first glance, but I think it is pretty nice against a turtling

**[15:34]** faction on land.

**[15:36]** Think about a chocho that has many acolytes and Cultists in one area, and it's maybe in

**[15:42]** West Africa or something they chose to start there.

**[15:45]** It's a great way to force them to move all their acolytes into the ocean.

**[15:49]** They do get to choose.

**[15:51]** Keep that in mind.

**[15:52]** If you have many different adjacent ocean areas, they might just split them among those

**[15:57]** areas.

**[15:57]** They might move them all into one.

**[15:59]** They do get to decide.

**[16:00]** But if you are trying to evacuate a particular land area, I think this is going to work pretty

**[16:04]** nicely.

**[16:06]** Spellbook requirement for Father Dagon.

**[16:08]** You have eight units in ocean areas.

**[16:10]** Everything I was just saying about using this ability on your enemies, it does also work

**[16:16]** on your Cultists, and everything I was saying about you choosing the ocean areas also applies

**[16:21]** here.

**[16:22]** It sounds like it would cost a lot, but if you have them in the right land area when you

**[16:26]** set this up, you may only really need to be spending one or two Power on movement.

**[16:32]** And the Spellbook for Father Dagon is the Innsmouth look.

**[16:38]** An ongoing ability.

**[16:39]** During the doom phase, remove one of your acolyte Cultists from the map and out of the game

**[16:43]** permanently.

**[16:44]** Gain six Power.

**[16:46]** This is not optional.

**[16:47]** If you have no acolyte Cultists on the map, there's no effect.

**[16:51]** So pretty interesting Spellbook.

**[16:53]** This is another nice reference to the ending of the Shadows over Innsmouth story.

**[17:00]** No spoilers again, but you've had close to 100 years to read this one.

**[17:05]** This is representative of the Innsmouth denizens who are slowly turning into Deep Ones.

**[17:11]** Eventually they finally stop living on land altogether.

**[17:14]** They go down to Devil Reef to live with their other Deep One brothers and sisters forever

**[17:20]** because they're immortal now.

**[17:22]** I think this is a really cool reference to that story.

**[17:25]** Pretty spicy ability.

**[17:26]** The only consideration is to be careful when you're using this.

**[17:31]** Probably pretty unusual that you're going to have, you know, six Gates in a game of Cthulhu

**[17:35]** Wars, but if you use this too much, all of a sudden you're only able to control potentially

**[17:40]** three Gates because you've eaten half your acolytes with this.

**[17:43]** So be careful of that.

**[17:44]** If somebody starts capturing an acolyte or two, then you're suddenly capped on only a few

**[17:48]** Gates and you really don't want to be in that position.

**[17:51]** My advice would be to figure out if the game only has a couple more action phases anyways

**[17:57]** so that you can really just let this rip in the Doom phase, get that extra Power, and get

**[18:01]** off a Ritual.

**[18:03]** If you're planning to pay for Doom with a Ritual, this ability is going to be quite useful.

**[18:10]** Which factions like this one?

**[18:11]** I mean, obviously Cthulhu is probably getting this Spellbook immediately or without too much

**[18:17]** trouble.

**[18:18]** You're just going to be in the ocean in general.

**[18:20]** Probably going to have a Cthulhu death ball in the ocean.

**[18:22]** Should get this pretty immediately.

**[18:25]** Otherwise, I'd say any faction like the Cho's, any faction that's going to want a Ritual every

**[18:30]** turn, I'd say you probably want to give up between two and three Cultist max here.

**[18:35]** But if you can do a couple of Rituals, I think you're going to be on your way to winning the

**[18:40]** game and being able to do more later.

**[18:45]** And now let's move on to the last of our great old ones.

**[18:49]** It's Gatanathoa.

**[18:51]** This one is from the story Out of the Aeons by HP Lovecraft.

**[18:56]** The sculpt for this one is really awesome.

**[18:59]** I think this is one of my favorite ones.

**[19:00]** Before I had the Demon Sultan faction in person, I was using this as a stand-in for one of the

**[19:07]** Azathoth avatars.

**[19:08]** So if you're ever wondering about using proxies, I think this one is top-notch.

**[19:13]** It looks like a nasty shell, spidery shell thing with eyes and legs.

**[19:20]** The inside is even cooler.

**[19:21]** It's like a bubbly texture.

**[19:23]** I'm not sure if these are all meant to be eyes or what.

**[19:25]** But very cool, very gross-looking, bug-like, insect-like, caviar-like.

**[19:34]** Okay, how to awaken Gatanathoa.

**[19:36]** Your controlled Gates in an area with your great old one.

**[19:39]** Pay 4 Power and place Gatanathoa in the area containing the Gate.

**[19:44]** And the combat for Gatanathoa is equal to the number of Cultists your opponent has on the

**[19:49]** map.

**[19:50]** So pretty nice combat.

**[19:51]** Usually going to be pretty beefy.

**[19:53]** Probably 5 or 6 combat, depending on who you're fighting.

**[19:56]** That's pretty nice.

**[19:59]** The ability for Gatanathoa is mummify.

**[20:02]** It's a 1-cost action.

**[20:04]** Any enemy accolade Cultists sharing an area with Gatanathoa are immediately mummified.

**[20:09]** Lay mummified Cultist figures on their sides.

**[20:12]** Such Cultists cannot use the move action, do not participate in battle, and produce no Power

**[20:17]** during the next gather Power phase.

**[20:19]** During the doom phase, stand any mummified Cultists back up.

**[20:25]** A mummified Cultist can be captured.

**[20:28]** If a Cultist controlled a Gate before becoming mummified, it retains control of the Gate.

**[20:32]** This is a pretty mean ability to use in an area with many Cultists.

**[20:38]** You can really hurt some factions like a Cho or something that's trying to just be on a couple of Gates and with many meat shields.

**[20:47]** You can turn them off all at once using mummify.

**[20:50]** The Spellbook requirement for Gatanathoa.

**[20:55]** Either you have fewer than 6 total Gates and Cultists in the doom phase, or as an action, pay 4 Power.

**[21:02]** Interesting optional cost here, so you could just pay 4.

**[21:05]** That's easy enough.

**[21:07]** Having fewer than 6 total Gates or Cultists in the doom phase.

**[21:11]** Could be easier, difficult to get that depending on your faction.

**[21:16]** You might just be in the position to not try too hard and have this, but other factions might have a more difficult time.

**[21:23]** And they might just want to pay the 4 Power.

**[21:26]** And the Spellbook for this one is called Execration of Mew.

**[21:30]** Ongoing ability.

**[21:32]** The mummify ability we mentioned earlier is no longer in action.

**[21:35]** It now occurs instantly when any enemy accolade Cultists share an area with Gatanathoa.

**[21:42]** So wow.

**[21:43]** Just even more icing on the cake here that is the mummify ability.

**[21:49]** It just makes it even cheaper.

**[21:51]** Nobody gets to react to you.

**[21:53]** I think once you have unlimited combat in that same situation,

**[21:56]** if somebody's trying to hide their juicy unit among a bunch of Cultists,

**[22:02]** it's not going to be safe from Gato.

**[22:04]** So you can move in there, mummify everything at instant speed.

**[22:09]** I think most factions would like this.

**[22:12]** Maybe factions that are trying to reach out and touch other factions interact a bit more would like this more.

**[22:17]** So maybe like Crawling Chaos could be nice.

**[22:21]** Anything that is more mobile and not wanting to stay in a couple of areas,

**[22:26]** I think could make good use of this.

**[22:27]** And I think that brings us to the end of the episode.

**[22:35]** I think this is a pretty interesting expansion.

**[22:38]** I really, really like Bokrug and Atlachnacha.

**[22:42]** Father Dagon seems like it could be a little bit on the weaker side,

**[22:45]** but I can see the utility there too.

**[22:47]** The Tanithoa, pretty mean, pretty generically good,

**[22:52]** but maybe not the best great old one I've ever seen.

**[22:57]** I could do with more games with both Father Dagon and Gato and all of these.

**[23:03]** I think I've said in the other episode I quite like the independent great old ones as like a neutrals to include.

**[23:10]** They don't cost you doom when you put them in the game.

**[23:13]** That's my favorite part about them.

**[23:15]** If you've not tried this, I think it's worth picking up.

**[23:18]** Atlachnacha, I love the extra access on the game to win by building those webs.

**[23:24]** Give that a go sometime and let me know what happened.

**[23:28]** I'm sure this one generates a lot of good and bad stories.

**[23:34]** So that's another episode in the books.

**[23:37]** Thank you very much for listening.
