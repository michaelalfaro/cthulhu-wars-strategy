## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:23]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host. Hope you're doing well. It's early morning for me, recording, that's usually the best time for me. It's nice and quiet.

**[00:34]** It's a little bit chilly outside now, but it seems like it's finally getting warm, and spring is starting to spring, although all the pollen that comes with that is also here, so I hope I don't get too stuffy as things go on.

**[00:48]** With this pair of episodes coming out, I'm going to take a little bit of a break from the faction guides. Not that I don't want to keep doing those, I do. It's actually the thing I'm the most excited about doing.

**[01:00]** But I think part of the mission of the pod has been achieved in that I wanted to make a guide for Demon Sultan and Bubastus before most of the Kickstarter backers get their products, and I've done that.

**[01:16]** I predict a lot more people are going to be listening to those episodes in the coming months as folks start getting hold of their stuff in person.

**[01:26]** So anyway, I don't really feel like I'm under the gun to knock out all the faction guides as quickly as possible.

**[01:32]** There's a lot of other content to cover in Cthulhu Wars as well, so I'm just going to be exploring that.

**[01:38]** I'm probably going to do something like every other episode is a faction guide, something like that.

**[01:43]** If you have a faction you specifically want to hear about next, definitely send me a message. Maybe you can influence my decision.

**[01:53]** I actually have a few outlines written at this point. I'm not going to tell you for which factions, but I could cover your faction next. You never know.

**[02:02]** This is the most abstract, but possibly also the most important episode of Opening the Way to date.

**[02:09]** I'm going to talk about some stuff in this episode I did not mention in my How to Play episode, nor did I mention this too much in my Advanced Tactics episode.

**[02:20]** That's because I feel like this topic or set of topics is actually a little bit beyond the mechanics of the game,

**[02:27]** in that it's sort of an art form, you could say, not something that can be perfected, not a perfect science.

**[02:33]** I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about general concepts of games as a whole for a minute.

**[02:41]** Every game, there's one or more axes on which the players can leverage in order to pull off a win.

**[02:51]** Two common things you will find in many games are skill and luck.

**[02:57]** So let's give a few examples.

**[02:58]** Chess is a very popular game.

**[03:02]** The outcome of that game is entirely dependent on skill.

**[03:06]** As long as the better player doesn't make a mistake, they should win 100% of the time.

**[03:11]** That's fine.

**[03:13]** Chess is not my favorite game.

**[03:14]** I'm not the best chess player in the world.

**[03:16]** Far from it.

**[03:17]** Another example would be something like poker, or maybe in the video game world, something like Mario Kart 8,

**[03:23]** a game I play quite a bit with my nephew.

**[03:26]** These are games that have a skill component, but they also introduce a luck component.

**[03:34]** In poker, that's the luck of the draw.

**[03:37]** And in Mario Kart, that might be the items that you end up obtaining during the race.

**[03:43]** Both these games, I'd say, are still heavily weighted in the skill department.

**[03:48]** So the better player is usually going to win, though there is some element of randomness that is out of the control of the players.

**[03:58]** And that element can also affect the outcome of the game.

**[04:03]** Cthulhu Wars also has a skill factor and a luck factor, but also a very important third axis.

**[04:10]** Because it's a multiplayer game, I'm talking, of course, about politics, table talk, whatever you like to call it.

**[04:19]** I believe this has a very, very significant effect on every game of Cthulhu Wars.

**[04:26]** Let me just profile a couple different kinds of Cthulhu Wars players here.

**[04:30]** There are new players to the game, people with, you know, five or less games of experience.

**[04:35]** They don't have a lot of skill, they might have a lot of luck, and they may have good politics.

**[04:41]** The new players, they're likely to lose because they don't have the great skill yet.

**[04:46]** They don't have the mechanical knowledge of maybe the faction that they're playing,

**[04:51]** but probably the factions at the table, they don't fully understand what they're capable of.

**[04:56]** That is fine, everyone has to start somewhere.

**[05:00]** We've got the experience to advanced player group, where they probably have some amount of skills.

**[05:07]** They might be pretty skilled, but occasionally will still lose games due to luck and variance.

**[05:14]** And I'm speaking mostly of battle luck, of course, like rolling pains and kills.

**[05:19]** We've all been in those games where somebody rolls 10 dice and for some reason they roll like 6 kills,

**[05:25]** and there's nothing you can really do about that.

**[05:29]** Lastly, the best of the best Cthulhu Wars players, I think, are playing around that luck element of the game as much as possible.

**[05:37]** I mean, they're taking the safest battle engagements, or they're assessing their risk as good as they possibly can be.

**[05:45]** Even if they're playing mechanically perfectly, I think that they can still be thwarted pretty easily if they're not playing the game well politically.

**[05:58]** And that's something I really, really like about this game.

**[06:01]** It doesn't matter that I've played hundreds of games, and I've played many, many more games than anybody I play with in person.

**[06:09]** And that doesn't really matter if the people at the table get to talking and they want to take me down, they can.

**[06:15]** And there's not really anything I can do about it, even if I'm playing Black Goat, my favorite faction, and I'm playing it perfectly.

**[06:23]** It doesn't really matter.

**[06:25]** If everybody agrees that Black Goat needs to be taken down, there's probably not a lot you can do about it in the end,

**[06:30]** other than maybe talk about it with the table.

**[06:33]** And really, any game, or even in life, it's very, very useful to, after whatever it is is over,

**[06:44]** try to reflect and debrief a little bit, and try to figure out some key decision points that led to a certain outcome.

**[06:54]** This is going to help you a ton on your journey as a Cthulhu Wars player to grow and get better.

**[07:00]** Like a pretty normal reaction from an early player, let's just say you were playing your first game against the Sleeper,

**[07:07]** you probably lost because you didn't do anything about lethargy.

**[07:12]** Is the Sleeper faction overPowered?

**[07:14]** Maybe to you, in your limited experience, it seemed that way.

**[07:19]** Or what was more likely happening, and hopefully you're playing with an experienced player that can tell you this afterward,

**[07:25]** there was some significant...

**[07:29]** In your case, if you're new, you just didn't have the experience, you didn't make a mistake,

**[07:34]** you didn't know what you didn't know, but...

**[07:36]** I think the outcome of most games with non-beginner players,

**[07:39]** and I'm going to define that as people who, at a minimum, have seen every faction,

**[07:45]** maybe they know what every faction is capable of, they've seen them all on the table.

**[07:48]** I think the outcome of most games comes down to two different factors,

**[07:53]** which I will be talking about in this episode.

**[07:55]** One of them is threat assessment, the other one is politics.

**[08:00]** Even if the players are playing mechanically perfectly,

**[08:04]** and they're what you might call advanced players,

**[08:06]** I see a lot of games online on Tabletop Simulator

**[08:09]** where there can still be a pretty lopsided victory,

**[08:13]** entirely separate from that skill factor,

**[08:16]** and I think it's due to some political failures on multiple fronts.

**[08:22]** The first, one or more players failed to understand

**[08:26]** who was truly in the dominant position and didn't pick on them enough.

**[08:30]** That is the threat assessment.

**[08:33]** Number two, it was a bad game politically.

**[08:36]** Some players just fought each other just because,

**[08:40]** and they didn't address the true threat who posted to victory.

**[08:44]** The second one, don't let this be you playing a bad game politically,

**[08:50]** but I'm going to admit here it's very difficult to always play well politically.

**[08:55]** At this point I've been playing this game for almost four years,

**[08:59]** and I still play a bad political game more often than I would care to admit.

**[09:04]** It's just a skill that constantly needs practicing and polishing.

**[09:08]** You can apply this to other games as well.

**[09:10]** When you're playing any of these games, any of these four or five player games,

**[09:15]** let's assume a four player game.

**[09:17]** You're playing a four player game of Cthulhu Wars,

**[09:19]** you figure if all things are equal, you still only have like a 25% chance to win.

**[09:24]** So really, any edges that you can get on the other players,

**[09:29]** and I'm saying to you today that the tabletalk, the politics, can give you a huge edge.

**[09:34]** Any edges that you can get to get that 25 and bump it up a little bit higher

**[09:39]** so that you're more likely to win is worth doing.

**[09:43]** Here's a question.

**[09:44]** How many players in the world do you think play Cthulhu Wars perfectly or optimally?

**[09:51]** I suggest to you this number is very, very low,

**[09:55]** and I think even among that group who know all their mechanics,

**[10:00]** they know all their factions inside and out,

**[10:02]** they can win with any different faction that they choose to play.

**[10:05]** Even among that group, I think there's even fewer players

**[10:08]** who are also very, very savvy with their tabletalk and politics.

**[10:14]** These players are a very rare breed indeed,

**[10:17]** so always be on the lookout.

**[10:19]** If you think you know someone like that, don't ever count them out.

**[10:23]** They probably have some tricks up their sleeve in order to win a game.

**[10:26]** I'd like to dedicate this episode to Cheshire Katz on Discord,

**[10:33]** who in my very early days as a Cthulhu Wars player on Tabletop Simulator was a great mentor,

**[10:39]** gave me a lot of great debriefs after every game that I've played.

**[10:44]** If you ever want to thank anybody for this podcast, probably thank Cheshire.

**[10:49]** They had a significant amount to do with me learning a great deal about the game

**[10:55]** and getting more engaged because I kept my learning up and kept going.

**[10:59]** I'm going to break this guide down into two different parts.

**[11:04]** So the first one would be reading the board properly.

**[11:08]** That would be good threat assessment.

**[11:10]** And number two would be leveraging your politics and tabletalk

**[11:14]** in order to gain value and gain advantage in a game of Cthulhu Wars.

**[11:20]** Good threat assessment.

**[11:22]** This might sound like a simple thing to do, figure out who is the threat,

**[11:27]** but as you'll see there's a number of factors which make it a little bit more complicated.

**[11:35]** I've got a little bit of a checklist here,

**[11:38]** and I would say these are the main hallmarks of a strong position.

**[11:43]** If one or more of these is true about a player,

**[11:46]** that might help you identify the leader.

**[11:50]** These are all things that are going to draw the attention of the other players

**[11:55]** and gain you some heat, if you will, borrowing that term from another podcast.

**[12:02]** First thing, the most obvious thing I'm sure that you're thinking about already,

**[12:05]** who has the highest raw doom count?

**[12:09]** If there is a player that has double digits of doom, 15 doom,

**[12:14]** the other players have less than that, they only are in 8 or 9 doom,

**[12:17]** that player on 15 doom is the leader,

**[12:20]** you need to be sure that this person does not end the round on 3 or 4 or 5 Gates,

**[12:27]** otherwise you're just never going to be able to catch up to them.

**[12:31]** It's as simple as that.

**[12:32]** This is a thing you should watch for, but not the only thing to watch for.

**[12:37]** With the doom count going right along with that,

**[12:40]** we have the Elder Sign count.

**[12:43]** Who has the most Elder Signs?

**[12:45]** This is something that's pretty interesting about this game,

**[12:48]** because as you know, the Elder Signs are hidden doom points,

**[12:51]** and they are 1.67 doom points on average.

**[12:56]** You might be able to figure out who the leader is just looking at the Elder Signs.

**[13:01]** Depending on the factions on the table, it might be very obvious.

**[13:04]** If a yellow sign is in play,

**[13:06]** maybe they're sitting on a handful, 5 to 10 Elder Signs.

**[13:10]** It will be clear that they're probably the threat there.

**[13:12]** You might have some games with more of the fighty side of the spectrum.

**[13:18]** Those factions might not have that many Elder Signs,

**[13:20]** but regardless of the count of Elder Signs people have,

**[13:24]** you shall also try to maybe look for how players are playing.

**[13:29]** That might indicate to you what the scores on their Elder Signs are.

**[13:32]** Just a quick example,

**[13:35]** if somebody only has 2 or 3 Elder Signs,

**[13:38]** and only 1 great old one,

**[13:40]** and they choose to ritual on a couple of Gates,

**[13:43]** and that's going to put them up to around early 20s of doom,

**[13:49]** you might be able to draw a conclusion from that,

**[13:51]** that their Elder Signs are in fact 2s and 3s,

**[13:54]** and you're in big danger if they have just ritualed.

**[13:57]** Third thing to watch for.

**[14:01]** The leader has a large Power differential relative to the other players.

**[14:08]** So as a player,

**[14:09]** they're not necessarily ahead on doom and Elder Sign count.

**[14:13]** They're maybe like right in pace with the rest of the pack.

**[14:16]** However, they had a good round.

**[14:19]** They chose not to ritual,

**[14:20]** and because they didn't ritual,

**[14:22]** they might have a significant Power lead on the other players.

**[14:26]** I'm talking like maybe between 5 and 6 Power.

**[14:29]** Something that's going to translate to

**[14:31]** some extra actions after others are spent out of Power,

**[14:37]** and might translate to a lead,

**[14:40]** a bigger lead maybe that they already have

**[14:42]** in the next gather Power phase,

**[14:43]** if they spend their Power wisely.

**[14:47]** Certain factions,

**[14:48]** you really don't want them to have a ton of Power,

**[14:50]** like a black goat with a ton of Power

**[14:52]** might just start grothing every turn.

**[14:54]** That's a bad time.

**[14:57]** Another factor in assessing the leader

**[14:59]** is Spellbook count.

**[15:02]** Does the player have unlimited combat,

**[15:04]** or are they close to getting it?

**[15:07]** This one is also pretty basic.

**[15:09]** We know that unlimited combat

**[15:11]** is a pretty big game changer,

**[15:13]** especially for certain factions.

**[15:14]** The first player to earn this ability,

**[15:17]** the unlimited combat,

**[15:18]** has a significant edge over the other players,

**[15:21]** and the right faction can really leverage this

**[15:24]** and suppress the opponents.

**[15:25]** I'm thinking of a Cthulhu specifically

**[15:28]** having unlimited combat

**[15:30]** way before the other players.

**[15:32]** You can do a lot of damage there.

**[15:35]** Those are the short list of identifying factors.

**[15:39]** There may be some other factors

**[15:40]** that are faction specific,

**[15:42]** but I'm trying to keep it pretty general here.

**[15:44]** Take these into account.

**[15:46]** When you're trying to do your internal math

**[15:49]** to figure out who's actually winning the game

**[15:51]** or who's in the lead,

**[15:52]** try to think ahead a little bit if you can.

**[15:56]** How close is the leader to winning the game?

**[16:00]** If it's getting toward the end of the action phase,

**[16:03]** try to figure out how much initial doom

**[16:06]** plus the doom from the ritual

**[16:08]** plus the Elder Signs

**[16:10]** a certain player is going to get

**[16:11]** at the start of the next action phase.

**[16:14]** Try to figure out if that is going to put them up to 30

**[16:17]** or get them close to 30.

**[16:20]** If so, what can you do

**[16:22]** to remove enough of their Gates

**[16:24]** or great old ones

**[16:26]** to stop them from winning?

**[16:28]** Does the player have any way to win

**[16:30]** in the action phase?

**[16:32]** Supposing nothing is done about them

**[16:34]** if they get up to 27 doom or something,

**[16:36]** do they have a way to get more doom

**[16:38]** in the action phase?

**[16:39]** You need to be mindful of that.

**[16:42]** Do you need help to stop this person from winning?

**[16:46]** How are you doing relative to the person

**[16:50]** that you think is winning?

**[16:51]** Do you need to deal with them

**[16:52]** or can you actually just ignore them

**[16:54]** and try to erase them?

**[16:56]** Lastly, and this goes along with the first point,

**[16:59]** how many action phases do you see in the game still?

**[17:02]** Is it one? Is it two?

**[17:04]** Try to figure that out.

**[17:06]** This is an important question.

**[17:08]** I think you might want some advice

**[17:10]** from the other players at the table

**[17:11]** to try to answer that one.

**[17:14]** If you know the leader of the game

**[17:16]** is going to get into the high 20s

**[17:17]** and not actually win,

**[17:19]** you need to actually really take some time

**[17:22]** in the following action phase

**[17:24]** to try to convince the other players

**[17:26]** that this player needs to be pulled down.

**[17:29]** Math it out for them.

**[17:30]** It will make sense if they see the raw numbers.

**[17:33]** Do you need help to stop this player

**[17:37]** from winning the game?

**[17:38]** Likely yes, unless you're in second place

**[17:41]** and you're close behind,

**[17:43]** you may need some assistance from the other players.

**[17:46]** And that should be easy to do.

**[17:48]** If somebody's really doing well

**[17:49]** and they're on a lot of Gates,

**[17:50]** they're also going to be spread thin.

**[17:52]** And that means they're going to be

**[17:53]** probably more close by to other players.

**[17:57]** And that's going to be easier for you

**[17:59]** to get good help from others nearby.

**[18:04]** And that's sort of it for part one.

**[18:06]** It's not an exact science to assess the threat,

**[18:10]** but this is all segueing into part two,

**[18:13]** which is politics, table talk,

**[18:16]** what Cheshire likes to call

**[18:18]** the Power of friendship.

**[18:20]** And this is just everything you can do

**[18:21]** above board to try to get the W for yourself.

**[18:25]** As I said at the top of the guide,

**[18:29]** you're not going to be able to win games

**[18:30]** against good Cthulhu Wars players

**[18:32]** based on your skill alone.

**[18:35]** I think the politics and table talk

**[18:36]** is incredibly relevant to your success.

**[18:40]** Every game, you should be trying to figure out,

**[18:43]** do you want to make allies?

**[18:44]** And if so, with who?

**[18:46]** Do you want to manipulate the other players?

**[18:48]** Who do you want to manipulate?

**[18:50]** And you should be asking yourself those questions

**[18:52]** throughout the game,

**[18:53]** not just at the start,

**[18:54]** not just toward the end,

**[18:55]** but everywhere in between.

**[18:57]** If you don't believe me

**[18:59]** that the politicking is extremely important

**[19:01]** in this game,

**[19:02]** I have got a question for you.

**[19:04]** How much value,

**[19:06]** maybe in terms of Power savings,

**[19:08]** how much value would you ascribe

**[19:10]** to somebody who has completely done

**[19:14]** your dirty work for you?

**[19:16]** You don't need to get your hands dirty at all

**[19:19]** or lose any of your units.

**[19:21]** And let's say,

**[19:22]** Great Cthulhu punched Windwalker into oblivion,

**[19:27]** and that was kind of who you were worried about.

**[19:29]** In this example,

**[19:30]** if you didn't need to do anything for this

**[19:33]** and you just talked Cthulhu into it,

**[19:35]** that's got to be worth something.

**[19:37]** To me, this has got to be worth

**[19:39]** at least as much as a decently expensive ritual,

**[19:42]** if not more.

**[19:42]** I mean, I'm thinking this is worth

**[19:44]** at least 7 to 10 Power.

**[19:47]** After these decisive battles,

**[19:49]** the balance of the game

**[19:51]** and the eventual winner might shift after all.

**[19:53]** So I would say to you,

**[19:55]** if you can talk somebody

**[19:56]** into doing something like that,

**[19:58]** it's worth so, so much Power,

**[20:00]** and you didn't have to put anything

**[20:02]** you had at risk.

**[20:03]** Just think about that.

**[20:04]** On this topic of politics,

**[20:08]** I want to talk about a little bit of a concept.

**[20:09]** I'm going to steal this from another podcast,

**[20:11]** the Woodland War Machine podcast about Root.

**[20:14]** I thought this was very applicable

**[20:15]** to other games like Cthulhu Wars.

**[20:18]** This is gaining and shedding heat.

**[20:21]** Gaining heat basically is going to be

**[20:23]** drawing attention, unwanted attention to you,

**[20:25]** and shedding heat is going to be

**[20:27]** decreasing the attention on yourself,

**[20:29]** decreasing the concern around you,

**[20:31]** and hopefully passing it off to other players.

**[20:34]** So one thing you can do in a game here

**[20:38]** is brand the other players at the table,

**[20:41]** not literally, of course,

**[20:42]** and that'd be like putting heat on somebody else,

**[20:45]** or if you're trying to shed heat off of yourself,

**[20:48]** try to, like, quote-unquote,

**[20:50]** do the right thing,

**[20:51]** claim the moral high ground

**[20:53]** to try to shed the heat.

**[20:55]** So if you see something in the game,

**[20:56]** say something.

**[20:57]** Did somebody steal multiple Gates

**[20:59]** at the start of the game?

**[21:01]** They are the problem right now.

**[21:02]** Make sure everybody knows that.

**[21:04]** Is this player known for being sneaky?

**[21:07]** Are they known for not keeping their word?

**[21:09]** You should let everybody know

**[21:10]** how underhanded this person can be.

**[21:12]** That alone can draw heat.

**[21:14]** Is this player for sure in last place

**[21:18]** right now in the game?

**[21:19]** I think you should be trying to befriend that player.

**[21:21]** That's a great way of shedding heat,

**[21:23]** also forming an alliance.

**[21:25]** Try to befriend players.

**[21:28]** Let's go over some quick things

**[21:30]** that will gain you heat,

**[21:32]** and these are not going to be unfamiliar

**[21:34]** if you just listen to the section

**[21:37]** on identifying the leader in threat assessment.

**[21:41]** Ritualing and putting yourself firmly ahead

**[21:43]** in the doom count.

**[21:44]** That'll gain you heat.

**[21:45]** Choosing not to ritual

**[21:47]** and having a large Power advantage

**[21:48]** over the other players.

**[21:49]** That is also going to gain you heat.

**[21:51]** Stealing one or more Gates

**[21:53]** from the other players

**[21:54]** in an action phase.

**[21:55]** If those players are paying attention,

**[21:58]** that's going to gain you some heat.

**[22:00]** You have the most controlled Gates

**[22:02]** of all the players.

**[22:03]** That's going to draw some attention to you.

**[22:06]** You're in second place probably,

**[22:08]** and you kill the great old one

**[22:10]** of the first player

**[22:11]** or crippled them in some way

**[22:13]** to knock them out of the lead.

**[22:15]** That will gain you heat.

**[22:17]** You're the first player

**[22:18]** to earn your sixth Spellbook

**[22:20]** and get unlimited combat.

**[22:22]** Also going to gain you heat.

**[22:25]** How about shedding heat?

**[22:26]** Things that will hopefully

**[22:27]** make you less of a target.

**[22:30]** Deal making.

**[22:32]** Talk to people at the table.

**[22:33]** Ask them if there's favors

**[22:35]** that you can do for them.

**[22:36]** Great example I see.

**[22:38]** Not enough.

**[22:39]** Telling someone that you'll

**[22:40]** willingly step off the Gate for them.

**[22:42]** You can do this.

**[22:42]** This is an unlimited action.

**[22:44]** Stepping on and off the Gate.

**[22:45]** Mostly people step onto Gates.

**[22:47]** You can also step off the Gate.

**[22:49]** Tell someone,

**[22:50]** I'm willingly step off this Gate for you

**[22:53]** just so that you don't do

**[22:54]** XYZ to me later.

**[22:56]** That's a great idea.

**[22:57]** Another way you can shed heat

**[22:59]** is by quote unquote

**[23:01]** doing the right thing

**[23:02]** and calling attention to it.

**[23:05]** Let's say you're Cthulhu

**[23:07]** and everyone's pretty much

**[23:09]** figured out who the threat is.

**[23:11]** Just say something like,

**[23:13]** I want everybody to take notes.

**[23:14]** I am going after the leader.

**[23:16]** We've discussed this person

**[23:17]** as leader.

**[23:18]** I am going after them.

**[23:19]** Do not do anything to me now

**[23:21]** because I am taking care

**[23:22]** of the problem.

**[23:23]** Do not blame me later

**[23:24]** because of the outcome of the game.

**[23:25]** I was doing my job

**[23:26]** and going after the leader

**[23:28]** at the right time.

**[23:29]** Something like that,

**[23:30]** if you're playing with savvy players,

**[23:32]** they will probably appreciate

**[23:33]** that you are doing your best

**[23:35]** to drag down the leader.

**[23:38]** Another way to shed heat

**[23:39]** is by balancing

**[23:41]** and not controlling

**[23:42]** any more Gates than anybody else.

**[23:44]** Kind of goes along

**[23:45]** with the first point,

**[23:47]** stepping off Gates strategically.

**[23:49]** People might not notice

**[23:50]** that you still have three Gates

**[23:52]** if two other players

**[23:54]** also have that mount.

**[23:55]** So that's just something

**[23:56]** to keep in mind.

**[23:58]** Last way,

**[23:59]** great way to shed heat

**[24:00]** is to reveal

**[24:01]** your Elder Signs early.

**[24:03]** Typically in a game,

**[24:05]** the end of the game

**[24:06]** will be when the players reveal,

**[24:08]** but you may run into situations

**[24:10]** where you have some amount

**[24:12]** of Elder Signs,

**[24:13]** people are rightfully

**[24:14]** calling you out

**[24:15]** as the leader or the threat,

**[24:17]** and they're pointing

**[24:17]** to your Elder Signs

**[24:18]** when they say that they're saying.

**[24:19]** So-and-so,

**[24:20]** they've got five Elder Signs,

**[24:21]** they've got so many more Doom

**[24:23]** because of those Elder Signs.

**[24:25]** If your Elder Signs are bad

**[24:27]** and people are going to

**[24:28]** identify you as the leader,

**[24:29]** you should show them occasionally.

**[24:31]** Show them the ones,

**[24:32]** get them to get off your back

**[24:34]** by showing those ones off.

**[24:36]** Of course,

**[24:36]** this is not going to work

**[24:37]** if you have five Elder Signs

**[24:39]** and you reveal two ones.

**[24:41]** They can figure out

**[24:42]** that you've got at least

**[24:43]** three others

**[24:44]** that are at least a two.

**[24:46]** You've got six Doom,

**[24:47]** that's still a lot of Doom.

**[24:48]** You're probably still in trouble.

**[24:49]** So this technique's only going to work

**[24:51]** if your Elder Signs

**[24:52]** are actually bad.

**[24:53]** So keep that in mind.

**[24:55]** Let's go over some good times

**[24:57]** for table talk in the game.

**[25:00]** I actually think that's always,

**[25:01]** you can always be table talking

**[25:03]** in the game,

**[25:03]** but just some examples.

**[25:05]** Right after the game starts,

**[25:07]** think about,

**[25:08]** can you do anybody a favor?

**[25:11]** So I'm thinking things like,

**[25:13]** Yellow Sign has a Spellbook requirement

**[25:15]** where they give away

**[25:16]** three Doom to any player.

**[25:19]** Often that three Doom

**[25:21]** is given away,

**[25:22]** but it can be strategically too,

**[25:24]** to either like prop somebody up

**[25:25]** as a threat

**[25:26]** or to do someone a favor early on.

**[25:30]** Give someone three Doom,

**[25:31]** tell them like,

**[25:32]** hey, remember later

**[25:33]** that I gave you three Doom

**[25:35]** and I could have chosen somebody else.

**[25:38]** Speaking of Yellow Sign,

**[25:40]** another great time for table talk

**[25:41]** is when you need to go somewhere

**[25:43]** where you'd prefer not to

**[25:44]** for purposes of your Spellbook requirements.

**[25:47]** Yellow Sign's a great example.

**[25:49]** They are going to need to Desecrate

**[25:50]** in certain areas on the map

**[25:52]** and there may be units in those areas.

**[25:55]** So make sure the person in that area

**[25:58]** knows you're not going in there

**[25:59]** to capture or take your Gate.

**[26:01]** You're just going in there

**[26:02]** to get the Desecrate off

**[26:04]** and then you're going to leave.

**[26:05]** So please don't fight.

**[26:07]** Might be harder or easier to do

**[26:09]** depending on where you're at

**[26:11]** as Yellow Sign in your character arc,

**[26:13]** but more on that in the Yellow Sign guide.

**[26:17]** Another great time for table talk

**[26:19]** when you need to be sure

**[26:20]** that your stuff is going to remain untouched

**[26:23]** for the action phase or longer.

**[26:26]** Propose to somebody,

**[26:27]** maybe somebody that you've been fighting

**[26:28]** or maybe somebody that's

**[26:30]** talking about fighting you

**[26:31]** or somebody that's not talking to you at all

**[26:34]** but they're posturing

**[26:35]** like they're going to come after you.

**[26:38]** Crawling Chaos,

**[26:39]** I would love if we could both go

**[26:40]** for three Gate opening.

**[26:41]** How about we both do that

**[26:43]** and you leave me alone

**[26:44]** and I leave you alone

**[26:45]** in the next action phase.

**[26:47]** How does that sound?

**[26:49]** Be really specific.

**[26:50]** Don't say,

**[26:51]** hey, Crawling Chaos,

**[26:52]** what if we both go for three Gate opening?

**[26:54]** Crawling Chaos could say,

**[26:54]** okay.

**[26:55]** And then the next action phase,

**[26:58]** they could awaken,

**[26:59]** they could come after your Gates.

**[27:00]** You didn't say that they couldn't do that.

**[27:02]** So just be careful.

**[27:04]** Read the fine print.

**[27:05]** I guess my advice.

**[27:07]** Another great time for table talk.

**[27:09]** One player, just ritual,

**[27:11]** they have a big doom lead now.

**[27:12]** That's something that's going to gain them heat

**[27:14]** to make sure everybody knows that.

**[27:15]** Tell everybody,

**[27:17]** this person is in the lead.

**[27:18]** After the doom phase,

**[27:19]** before anybody does anything else,

**[27:21]** just say,

**[27:22]** hey,

**[27:22]** everyone knows that the threat is right.

**[27:24]** It is this player.

**[27:25]** It is the cats.

**[27:25]** They just ritualed.

**[27:26]** They've got five or six more doom

**[27:28]** than everybody else.

**[27:29]** We need to do something about the cats.

**[27:32]** Another great opportunity for table talk

**[27:35]** is when there is a Power vacuum.

**[27:38]** Two players pretty much way in the lead

**[27:41]** compared to everybody else.

**[27:42]** They just butted head.

**[27:44]** They've just bashed each other

**[27:45]** and they lost everything.

**[27:47]** Everybody else on the table now

**[27:48]** should really be starting to talk about

**[27:50]** how this can be capitalized on.

**[27:54]** How can we take over the Gates

**[27:55]** that just got lost by these players?

**[27:58]** Talk to the other players

**[27:59]** who are not in first and second.

**[28:00]** Make some alliances.

**[28:01]** See how you can band together.

**[28:03]** Now that the leaders

**[28:04]** are not necessarily on the throne,

**[28:07]** this is a great time to figure out

**[28:08]** how you can just completely

**[28:10]** flip the Power dynamic on its head

**[28:12]** and pick some new leaders for the game.

**[28:16]** Last thing,

**[28:17]** you can see mathematically

**[28:19]** how somebody might reach 30 doom.

**[28:20]** This is this thinking ahead concept

**[28:22]** I talked about in the threat assessment section.

**[28:25]** If you can figure that out,

**[28:27]** make sure you tell the other players

**[28:29]** how the leader might accomplish

**[28:31]** this win so that they're aware

**[28:33]** that they can think for themselves

**[28:35]** a little bit about what to do next.

**[28:37]** I'm doing this one pretty constantly

**[28:39]** in every game,

**[28:41]** the mathing it out thing.

**[28:43]** I find it very, very useful.

**[28:45]** Even if people don't believe you

**[28:46]** after the game,

**[28:47]** take a tall drink from your glass of

**[28:50]** I told you so after the game

**[28:52]** when people don't listen to you

**[28:53]** when you've mapped it out for them.

**[28:57]** Last section of this episode,

**[28:59]** I want to just talk about some

**[29:01]** meta politics.

**[29:03]** You could really talk about this topic

**[29:04]** for hours and hours.

**[29:06]** I'm not going to do that,

**[29:07]** but let's talk about some meta politics,

**[29:10]** some things that transcend

**[29:11]** the specific game that you're in.

**[29:14]** Read the players at the table

**[29:16]** if you can.

**[29:17]** Are you playing with your friends

**[29:18]** in real life?

**[29:19]** Are you playing with

**[29:19]** randoms online?

**[29:22]** Who among those people

**[29:23]** is going to be okay with

**[29:25]** an underhanded tactic

**[29:26]** and who won't?

**[29:28]** If you can know that,

**[29:30]** that is very helpful.

**[29:32]** If you're playing with

**[29:32]** a bunch of strangers,

**[29:34]** I'm not sure what kind of tactic

**[29:36]** you might want to take.

**[29:37]** I tend to want to be nice

**[29:38]** to the strangers online,

**[29:40]** not do anything super mean to them

**[29:43]** unless they deserve it

**[29:44]** because I don't want any bad blood.

**[29:46]** I don't know how easily

**[29:49]** those folks can be reasoned with,

**[29:51]** so that's just something

**[29:52]** to keep in mind.

**[29:52]** Who has a lot of Cthulhu Wars experience

**[29:56]** and who doesn't?

**[29:58]** It might be easy for you

**[30:00]** to manipulate the inexperienced player,

**[30:03]** but do you even really want to do that?

**[30:06]** Wouldn't it be better to just

**[30:07]** have them as your ally

**[30:09]** and give them good advice?

**[30:11]** I think the answer there is mostly yes.

**[30:13]** I want them to be my friend.

**[30:15]** I don't want them to be like,

**[30:16]** hey, you tricked me.

**[30:19]** Should you be mean to the veteran player

**[30:21]** who has full awareness

**[30:23]** of what's going on,

**[30:24]** what you might call an advanced player?

**[30:26]** Absolutely, yes.

**[30:27]** You probably still want to, you know,

**[30:30]** keep your word with this player,

**[30:31]** but I would go out of my way

**[30:33]** to try to trick them,

**[30:35]** try to get them to make a mistake.

**[30:37]** They're probably not going to make a mistake

**[30:39]** if they're really good,

**[30:40]** but it doesn't mean you can't try to

**[30:42]** talk them into doing something

**[30:44]** that you know better

**[30:46]** that they probably shouldn't do.

**[30:47]** You may still be able to get away with it.

**[30:49]** Are you or someone else in the game

**[30:54]** the type that doesn't forget

**[30:56]** the betrayal from the previous game

**[30:59]** or even a game that happened

**[31:00]** last week or last month?

**[31:03]** You should take that into account

**[31:04]** once you're trying to calculate what to do.

**[31:06]** I'm laughing about this one,

**[31:08]** but it is true.

**[31:09]** People are spiteful.

**[31:10]** It's not just in this game.

**[31:11]** It's in many games.

**[31:13]** If you did something to wrong somebody,

**[31:15]** they might remember it

**[31:16]** and you need to be aware

**[31:19]** of those kind of players

**[31:20]** when you're planning out

**[31:21]** what you're going to do

**[31:22]** in a future game.

**[31:24]** It sounds silly,

**[31:25]** but if you're next to somebody

**[31:27]** who you betrayed,

**[31:29]** they could just like

**[31:30]** want to ruin your game

**[31:32]** and they don't care about winning.

**[31:33]** You need to think about that

**[31:35]** and plan accordingly.

**[31:37]** If you're playing with somebody

**[31:40]** that can't always be trusted,

**[31:42]** did they betray you last game?

**[31:43]** I would be using that.

**[31:45]** If yes,

**[31:46]** I would be using that as leverage

**[31:47]** and I'd make them work

**[31:49]** in the future game

**[31:50]** to get back into your good graces.

**[31:53]** Just saying something like,

**[31:54]** I am going to do you

**[31:55]** absolutely no favors

**[31:56]** until you earn back my trust.

**[31:58]** You lost my trust in that last game

**[32:00]** when you did XYZ.

**[32:02]** I think that's a totally

**[32:03]** legit thing to do.

**[32:04]** This is a great way to like

**[32:06]** get people to do your dirty work.

**[32:08]** Like,

**[32:08]** I'm not going to do anything for you

**[32:10]** until you do something nice for me.

**[32:13]** I love my wife.

**[32:14]** She will absolutely hold me to account

**[32:16]** with this one

**[32:16]** if I do something.

**[32:18]** I just want to say

**[32:19]** I am honorable.

**[32:20]** I keep my word,

**[32:21]** but my wife is definitely

**[32:23]** one to be like,

**[32:24]** hey,

**[32:24]** I remember in that game a month ago

**[32:26]** you did this.

**[32:27]** So,

**[32:27]** until you make it up to me,

**[32:29]** I'm not trusting anything

**[32:31]** you say or do in this game.

**[32:32]** Are you or somebody you know

**[32:35]** honorable,

**[32:36]** quote unquote honorable,

**[32:38]** and usually keep your word

**[32:40]** or do so as long as possible,

**[32:42]** you should also be using this

**[32:44]** to your advantage

**[32:45]** when you're table talking with people.

**[32:47]** Hey,

**[32:47]** I would never betray you.

**[32:49]** Name one time

**[32:50]** when I've ever been

**[32:51]** like an unreliable ally.

**[32:53]** This can be a really nice

**[32:54]** way to

**[32:55]** get people to be your ally.

**[32:58]** They know you're not going to like

**[32:59]** stab them in the back

**[33:00]** or at least not right away.

**[33:01]** I tend to play

**[33:02]** with the same group

**[33:03]** in real life

**[33:03]** and in the same sphere

**[33:05]** of players

**[33:06]** on Tabletop Simulator.

**[33:08]** I do think

**[33:08]** being honorable

**[33:09]** and keeping your word

**[33:10]** does go a long way

**[33:12]** ultimately

**[33:12]** in getting players

**[33:14]** to listen to what you have to say

**[33:15]** or not come after you

**[33:17]** when you tell them

**[33:18]** they should go after

**[33:19]** somebody else instead.

**[33:23]** I think that's it.

**[33:24]** I'm trying to keep this episode

**[33:25]** somewhat short,

**[33:26]** somewhat tight.

**[33:27]** I don't want to be rambling here.

**[33:29]** Like I said,

**[33:29]** I think you could talk

**[33:30]** about this topic

**[33:30]** go on and on and on about it.

**[33:33]** I'm trying not to do that.

**[33:35]** I'll leave you with this.

**[33:36]** I think words,

**[33:38]** your table talk,

**[33:39]** your above board tactics

**[33:40]** are the most Powerful thing

**[33:42]** you can do in this game

**[33:44]** if done correctly.

**[33:46]** Identifying the threat

**[33:47]** is one of the

**[33:49]** most essential skills

**[33:50]** you can have

**[33:51]** as a player

**[33:53]** on your journey

**[33:54]** to becoming better

**[33:55]** at this game.

**[33:56]** after every game

**[33:58]** I would suggest

**[33:59]** sitting down

**[33:59]** with the players

**[34:00]** and debriefing

**[34:02]** try to figure out

**[34:03]** did something go wrong

**[34:05]** somewhere?

**[34:05]** Did somebody like

**[34:06]** make a mistake?

**[34:07]** Did somebody make

**[34:08]** a like miscalculation?

**[34:10]** Did we assess

**[34:12]** the threat incorrectly?

**[34:13]** You should try and discuss

**[34:14]** all of that stuff

**[34:15]** because

**[34:15]** even if you are

**[34:17]** maybe a bit salty

**[34:18]** or

**[34:19]** you know

**[34:20]** having like a bit of

**[34:21]** an emotional reaction

**[34:22]** to the game

**[34:22]** that's totally normal

**[34:23]** you are entitled

**[34:24]** to have that reaction

**[34:25]** and you should.

**[34:26]** See that through

**[34:27]** to the end

**[34:27]** but

**[34:28]** it's very important

**[34:29]** afterward

**[34:30]** to

**[34:31]** talk objectively

**[34:32]** about the game

**[34:33]** that's going to help

**[34:34]** you learn

**[34:34]** and get better

**[34:36]** and apply

**[34:37]** what you've learned

**[34:38]** in the next game.

**[34:40]** And lastly

**[34:41]** both these topics

**[34:43]** the

**[34:43]** assessing the threat

**[34:45]** following the leader

**[34:46]** and

**[34:47]** the Power of friendship

**[34:49]** Power of friendship

**[34:50]** is the most

**[34:51]** Powerful thing

**[34:52]** in Cthulhu Wars

**[34:53]** if done correctly.

**[34:55]** I don't think

**[34:56]** it is an exact

**[34:58]** science

**[34:59]** but I do think

**[35:00]** this is a very

**[35:01]** meaty topic.
