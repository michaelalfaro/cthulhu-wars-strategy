## Transcript

**[00:00]** Again I shivered, for I did not like the things the night had brought, and wished bitterly that no forefather had summoned me to this primal right.

**[00:09]** As the steps in the passage grew broader, I heard another sound, the thin, whining mockery of a feeble flute.

**[00:16]** Suddenly there spread out before me the boundless vista of an inner world, a vast fungus shore, lit in by a belching column of sick greenish flame, and washed by a wide oily river that flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the blackest gulfs of immemorial ocean.

**[00:46]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:59]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[01:02]** Hope you're doing well wherever you are.

**[01:05]** I'm recording one more episode before I leave on vacation later this week.

**[01:10]** By the time you're hearing this will probably be the end of September.

**[01:13]** The time of recording last night was August 29th.

**[01:18]** I went on a lunar full moon walk with my wife and some people at this outdoor company near where we live.

**[01:27]** We live near a big park that has many trails to walk on.

**[01:32]** And yeah, we got some headlamps, we had some red light.

**[01:36]** We walked along the trails for about four miles last night in the dark.

**[01:39]** I thought it was very cool.

**[01:41]** It was actually a blue moon.

**[01:43]** We love moons here at Opening the Way.

**[01:46]** Normally there's only one full moon a month, but occasionally there's a blue moon, and that's the second full moon of every month.

**[01:53]** And it only happens once every two and a half years.

**[01:57]** The weather was great.

**[01:59]** The moon was really bright.

**[02:00]** We got to a big field where we did a guided meditation.

**[02:05]** And yes, we were meditating in the woods.

**[02:07]** Regrettably, there were no great old ones that showed up as a result of the meditation.

**[02:12]** That's okay.

**[02:13]** Maybe next time.

**[02:15]** What are we talking about today?

**[02:16]** Today we're doing another neutral expansion.

**[02:19]** This time, Great Old One Pack 4, which comes with three independent great old ones that you can add to your games of Cthulhu Wars.

**[02:27]** Quick recap on independent great old ones.

**[02:32]** You purchase them from the pool during the action phase.

**[02:37]** A lot of the time, they're going to require you to have your own great old one at one of your Gates.

**[02:42]** They function as great old ones themselves.

**[02:44]** They won't provide you an extra Elder Sign for a ritual.

**[02:47]** And if they ever get killed, they stop being loyal to you and they go back into the pool for somebody else to be able to buy them.

**[02:57]** Independent great old ones are typically pretty spicy.

**[03:00]** And I don't think these three are any exceptions.

**[03:02]** So I will just go ahead and get into it.

**[03:06]** Our first independent great old one to discuss today is Beatus.

**[03:10]** Beatus, the serpent bearded, the god of forgetfulness, came with the great old ones from the stars,

**[03:19]** called by obeisances made to his image, which was brought by the Deep Ones to earth.

**[03:24]** He may be called by the touching of his image by a living being.

**[03:28]** His gaze brings darkness on the mind, and it's told that those who look upon his eye will be forced to walk to his clutches.

**[03:35]** He feasts upon those who stray to him, and from those whom he feasts he draws a part of their vitality, and so grows vaster.

**[03:46]** This is a creation by our boy, Ramsey Campbell.

**[03:50]** More on him in future episodes.

**[03:53]** He's like a British Stephen King.

**[03:55]** He happened to write a lot of mythos stories as well.

**[03:58]** A lot of them actually made it into Cthulhu Wars.

**[04:01]** This one is from the story The Room in the Castle.

**[04:05]** Yeah, Beatus is the Toad of Berkeley.

**[04:09]** The sculpt for this one, I think, is very excellent.

**[04:12]** It's really, really reminiscent of the story.

**[04:17]** At least in the collection I have, there's art that goes with all the stories,

**[04:20]** and I think this one looks very, very much like the drawing in the story.

**[04:25]** I love that it's so similar.

**[04:27]** We've got what looks like a well, and the Toad of Berkeley, Beatus, is crawling out of the well.

**[04:34]** It does look vaguely toad-like, but there's just a ton of tentacles, maybe an arm.

**[04:39]** The tongue of Beatus looks awesome.

**[04:41]** It looks kind of like a lamprey eel, but it's very long and extended out.

**[04:46]** Beatus has like a single cyclopean eye.

**[04:49]** It looks very creepy.

**[04:50]** And this one's pretty sturdy, too.

**[04:53]** It's kind of heavy.

**[04:54]** I think if someone broke into my house and I throw this at them, I could do a number on them.

**[05:00]** How to awaken Beatus?

**[05:02]** It costs 4 Power.

**[05:04]** You must have a controlled Gate in an area with your great old one,

**[05:07]** and you can pay 4 Power and place Beatus in the area containing the Gate.

**[05:12]** Beatus has 4 combat,

**[05:14]** and the ability is the Toad of Berkeley.

**[05:18]** It's ongoing.

**[05:19]** Beatus may not move, nor can he be moved with movement-type abilities,

**[05:24]** such as Arctic Wind or Submerge.

**[05:26]** He can still be pained.

**[05:27]** If there are no enemy units in Beatus' area during the Doom phase,

**[05:31]** receive 1 Elder Sign.

**[05:34]** So, I'd say right off the bat, this one is already pretty dangerous with that Toad of Berkeley ability.

**[05:40]** Generally, people aren't going to want to hang out in your area

**[05:44]** unless they're planning on fighting you or capturing you,

**[05:47]** and if you wake this up on one of your Gates,

**[05:49]** and it's just sitting there and nobody's anywhere near you,

**[05:52]** you're just gaining an Elder Sign every turn the rest of the game,

**[05:55]** and you've got a nice beefy 4 combat, 4 cost, great old one,

**[05:59]** locking down your Gate in case anybody does show up.

**[06:03]** So I think that's really nice.

**[06:05]** The Spellbook requirement for Beatus.

**[06:07]** Beatus survives a battle in which at least one enemy unit is killed.

**[06:13]** So it makes sense.

**[06:14]** The Spellbook requirement is sort of like the opposite of the Toad of Berkeley.

**[06:19]** You will need to get somebody into Beatus' area and kill them

**[06:23]** in order to earn the Spellbook.

**[06:25]** And yeah, you might want to do that.

**[06:27]** The Spellbook is the God of Forgetfulness.

**[06:31]** It's a 1 cost action.

**[06:32]** Select all enemy Cultists in an area adjacent to Beatus.

**[06:36]** Those Cultists are moved into Beatus' area.

**[06:40]** I like the God of Forgetfulness a lot.

**[06:42]** This is another good example of taking something from the story,

**[06:45]** which is people being drawn to Beatus

**[06:47]** and putting it mechanically in the game.

**[06:49]** Very cool.

**[06:51]** Spellbook's pretty strong.

**[06:53]** The challenge is actually getting it.

**[06:55]** Again, you're going to need to get something into Beatus' area to kill it.

**[06:59]** Luckily, Beatus has 4 combat on his own,

**[07:02]** so he's potentially capable of doing that.

**[07:06]** I guess the real question is,

**[07:07]** do you even really need this Spellbook?

**[07:10]** I don't really think you do.

**[07:12]** It's sort of like the icing on the cake, so to speak.

**[07:15]** Obviously, if you can get it, great.

**[07:17]** If you're adjacent to people, amazing.

**[07:19]** You can just start dragging Cultists into the area.

**[07:22]** Your opponents are going to have to either move

**[07:24]** or move their great old one in to defend,

**[07:26]** which I'm not sure they're going to want to do that.

**[07:28]** If you can earn the God of Forgetfulness, great.

**[07:32]** If not, you're just earning an Elder Sign every turn,

**[07:34]** which I think is a really nice way of spending 4 Power.

**[07:40]** What factions like this?

**[07:42]** I think this is another generally useful great old one.

**[07:45]** Everybody likes getting an extra Elder Sign.

**[07:48]** Again, I think a 4 Power is a great deal for that.

**[07:51]** If you can ever manage to get the second Elder Sign from this,

**[07:54]** I really think it's paid for itself.

**[07:56]** Crawling Chaos might like this unit.

**[07:59]** Because of madness, it could be pretty easy for Crawling Chaos

**[08:02]** to actually meet the Spellbook requirement.

**[08:04]** You know, painting somebody from an adjacent battle with your opponents

**[08:08]** into Bionis' area, that's potentially a thing.

**[08:12]** But I would say, generally, maybe the defensive factions,

**[08:15]** like the Cho's or Ancients,

**[08:18]** or somebody that's going to want a ritual a lot,

**[08:19]** maybe Yellow Sign,

**[08:21]** they're also going to like this,

**[08:22]** just because it's a pretty nice way of holding down a Gate with a great old one,

**[08:27]** and you're just getting an Elder Sign for your trouble every turn.

**[08:30]** So the Doom Tempo is really strong with this one.

**[08:36]** I think that's enough about Bionis,

**[08:37]** so we can move on to our next independent great old one.

**[08:40]** Men know him as the Dweller in Darkness,

**[08:46]** a brother of the Old Ones called Nyagtha,

**[08:49]** the thing that should not be.

**[08:51]** He can be summoned to Earth's surface through certain secret caverns and fissures,

**[08:55]** and sorcerers have seen him in Syria and below the Black Tower of Leng.

**[08:59]** From the Thang Grotto of Tartary,

**[09:02]** he's come ravening to bring terror and destruction

**[09:04]** among the pavilions of the Great Khan.

**[09:08]** Only by the looped cross,

**[09:10]** by the Vakshviraj incantation,

**[09:13]** and by the Tikkun elixir,

**[09:15]** may he be driven back to the knighted caverns

**[09:17]** and hidden foulness where he dwelleth.

**[09:22]** Yes, our second great old one is Nyagtha,

**[09:26]** the thing that should not be...

**[09:29]** Sculpt looks very cool on this one.

**[09:32]** I should say Sculpts.

**[09:33]** They actually look identical,

**[09:35]** and you've never seen this one before.

**[09:37]** You're probably like,

**[09:38]** what are you saying?

**[09:39]** This one is two great old ones in one.

**[09:41]** Two for the price of one,

**[09:43]** which I'll explain.

**[09:45]** These look awesome.

**[09:46]** They just kind of look like a nasty goo,

**[09:49]** turning into kind of a Hydra thing.

**[09:53]** All the heads have lots of teeth

**[09:54]** and gnashing mouths.

**[09:57]** Pretty scary looking,

**[09:58]** and there's two of them.

**[09:59]** This great old one is from the story

**[10:03]** The Salem Horror by Henry Kuttner.

**[10:07]** I actually just got a hold of it

**[10:08]** and read before this podcast,

**[10:11]** so thank you, seller on eBay,

**[10:13]** for the quick shipping for this book

**[10:15]** that I have read.

**[10:18]** How to Awaken Nyagtha.

**[10:20]** It's a six-cost independent great old one.

**[10:23]** You must have a controlled Gate

**[10:24]** in an area with your great old one.

**[10:26]** You'll pay six Power,

**[10:28]** and you'll place all Nyagtha units

**[10:30]** from your pool

**[10:31]** to the area containing the Gate.

**[10:33]** So again, there are two of these,

**[10:35]** not just one.

**[10:37]** Combat on Nyagtha is four,

**[10:39]** but only if Nyagtha's faction

**[10:41]** declared the battle.

**[10:42]** If they didn't,

**[10:43]** it's only one.

**[10:46]** The ability on Nyagtha is from below.

**[10:49]** It's ongoing.

**[10:50]** Nyagtha is two units.

**[10:52]** Any common action involving

**[10:54]** one of these units

**[10:54]** can be applied simultaneously

**[10:56]** to the other

**[10:57]** as part of the same action

**[10:58]** and at no extra cost.

**[11:01]** When one Nyagtha moves,

**[11:03]** so may the other.

**[11:04]** When one captures a Cultist,

**[11:06]** so may the other.

**[11:07]** If battle is declared in one's area,

**[11:09]** you can also declare a battle

**[11:10]** in the other's area for free.

**[11:13]** You only lose this loyalty card

**[11:14]** if both Nyagtha units have been killed.

**[11:16]** The Spellbook requirement for Nyagtha.

**[11:21]** Nyagtha survives a battle

**[11:22]** against an enemy Great Old One.

**[11:26]** And the Spellbook for this Great Old One

**[11:28]** is Nightmare Web.

**[11:29]** It's an ongoing ability.

**[11:31]** If one of the Nyagtha units

**[11:33]** is in your pool,

**[11:34]** you can awaken it for two Power,

**[11:36]** placing it in any area

**[11:37]** which you have a unit.

**[11:40]** So let's unpack this one.

**[11:42]** First thing,

**[11:43]** double Great Old One.

**[11:44]** Very, very cool.

**[11:45]** I love this one.

**[11:47]** I will play it in every game

**[11:48]** if I can.

**[11:49]** If it's in the pool,

**[11:50]** I will buy this one.

**[11:51]** I am a sucker for Nyagtha.

**[11:55]** This is just a fundamentally Powerful

**[11:57]** Great Old One.

**[11:58]** Again, we know our Gates are safe

**[12:00]** from Great Old Ones

**[12:01]** essentially when you have

**[12:02]** a Great Old One of your own there,

**[12:04]** protecting them from capture anyway.

**[12:06]** You're getting two for the price of one here,

**[12:08]** so it's just making two of your Gates

**[12:10]** a little bit more difficult

**[12:11]** for your opponents to take from you,

**[12:13]** potentially.

**[12:13]** That is really, really nice.

**[12:15]** It's got sort of a similar

**[12:18]** Power saving mechanic on here.

**[12:21]** Kind of reminds me of

**[12:22]** the Hound of Tyndalos a little bit.

**[12:24]** Anything one Nyagtha decides to do,

**[12:27]** the other one can do too.

**[12:28]** It's not mandatory either,

**[12:30]** so you don't need to.

**[12:32]** Moving these around,

**[12:33]** pretty cheap.

**[12:33]** Only one Power,

**[12:34]** both can move.

**[12:36]** Same goes for battling

**[12:38]** and for capturing.

**[12:39]** So these can be pretty nice

**[12:41]** at the end of the action phase

**[12:43]** if you're managing to

**[12:44]** march both of them around

**[12:46]** at the same time

**[12:47]** and maybe capture

**[12:48]** at the same time.

**[12:49]** You can save a lot of Power

**[12:51]** doing this

**[12:51]** and reap a lot of Power

**[12:53]** from any Cultists

**[12:54]** that you stumble upon

**[12:55]** and might capture

**[12:56]** for two for the price of one.

**[13:00]** Spellbook requirement,

**[13:01]** surviving a battle against

**[13:03]** an enemy Great Old One,

**[13:04]** somewhat tricky to do.

**[13:06]** You're probably going to have

**[13:07]** to plan a little bit

**[13:07]** to make this happen

**[13:08]** and you're probably going to be

**[13:10]** the one who declares the battle

**[13:12]** because Nyagtha

**[13:14]** is not going to roll a lot of dice

**[13:16]** if you're not the one

**[13:17]** declaring the battle.

**[13:19]** The good news is

**[13:20]** marching two of these

**[13:21]** into the battle area

**[13:22]** is somewhat cheap

**[13:23]** and together they roll eight dice.

**[13:27]** Also remember,

**[13:28]** this one's only going to

**[13:30]** go back to the pool

**[13:31]** if both of them get killed,

**[13:32]** so for that reason,

**[13:34]** I would say, like,

**[13:34]** maybe just YOLO

**[13:36]** march them into an area

**[13:38]** with the Great Old One

**[13:38]** and fight,

**[13:39]** maybe with one other unit

**[13:40]** just in case,

**[13:41]** but I think, you know,

**[13:42]** if they're rolling around,

**[13:43]** you know, six to ten dice,

**[13:45]** unlikely both Nyagtha get killed.

**[13:47]** I would feel better

**[13:48]** having a third unit there,

**[13:49]** but I'm happy to get

**[13:51]** whatever random monster

**[13:53]** Cultists I bring with me

**[13:54]** killed in one of the Nyagtha.

**[13:56]** That's fine.

**[13:57]** Once you have Nightmare Web,

**[13:59]** replacing this for only two Power

**[14:00]** is, like, an amazing deal,

**[14:02]** so totally worth it.

**[14:04]** Otherwise,

**[14:05]** getting one of these killed

**[14:06]** is feeling pretty bad.

**[14:08]** You're going to have to

**[14:09]** pay six Power to awaken.

**[14:10]** You want to avoid that

**[14:11]** if you can.

**[14:14]** What factions like this?

**[14:15]** This is another one,

**[14:16]** I think,

**[14:16]** very well-rounded.

**[14:18]** Everybody's going to enjoy this.

**[14:19]** The fighty factions

**[14:20]** that want to have a death ball,

**[14:22]** they're going to love

**[14:23]** having eight additional

**[14:24]** combat dice from two units

**[14:25]** to bring with them.

**[14:27]** The less mobile factions

**[14:28]** are going to enjoy

**[14:29]** having two Great Old Ones

**[14:31]** potentially to protect

**[14:32]** their Gates,

**[14:33]** but also to help them, like,

**[14:35]** be sneaking around

**[14:36]** and maybe expanding

**[14:37]** their Gates, too,

**[14:38]** with the ability

**[14:39]** to save on movement

**[14:40]** from Nyagtha

**[14:41]** and save on capturing.

**[14:43]** That's a huge deal

**[14:44]** for any faction

**[14:45]** that cares about

**[14:46]** every doom point

**[14:47]** and getting those rituals off.

**[14:50]** Very awesome Great Old One.

**[14:52]** One of my favorite

**[14:53]** neutral units,

**[14:53]** to be honest,

**[14:54]** alongside the Toad.

**[14:56]** Very, very cool.

**[14:56]** Our last independent

**[15:02]** Great Old One

**[15:02]** to discuss is

**[15:04]** Tolcha.

**[15:05]** Tolcha.

**[15:06]** Yeah,

**[15:07]** not sure how to pronounce

**[15:08]** this one, honestly.

**[15:09]** T-U-L-Z-C-H-A

**[15:11]** Tolcha.

**[15:13]** This one's pretty cool-looking,

**[15:14]** sort of a living flame,

**[15:16]** sort of a Cthuga-style

**[15:18]** looking Great Old One.

**[15:20]** Just looks like a ball of fire,

**[15:22]** but it's got a little bit

**[15:22]** of a face and a mouth.

**[15:25]** Looks kind of cool,

**[15:25]** a little bit cute,

**[15:26]** actually,

**[15:27]** a little endearing.

**[15:28]** Doesn't look that creepy to me.

**[15:30]** Looks like it will help

**[15:30]** keep me warm.

**[15:33]** I had to do a little bit

**[15:35]** of research to figure out

**[15:36]** which this one is from.

**[15:38]** I'm told by the internet

**[15:39]** this is from

**[15:40]** the H.P. Lovecraft story,

**[15:41]** The Festival,

**[15:42]** which I read to you

**[15:43]** a little bit of.

**[15:45]** Fun story,

**[15:46]** actually sort of

**[15:47]** doing a spin

**[15:48]** on Christmas holiday time,

**[15:50]** so recommend you read it

**[15:51]** if you want to know more.

**[15:54]** Tolcha is not name-dropped

**[15:55]** in that story,

**[15:56]** but I'm told by the internet

**[15:57]** that this was also part

**[15:59]** of Call of Cthulhu,

**[16:00]** which I guess Sandy

**[16:01]** had some involvement in.

**[16:02]** Maybe he's the one

**[16:03]** that actually named

**[16:04]** this Great Old One.

**[16:06]** Anyway,

**[16:07]** how to awaken Tolcha.

**[16:09]** Costs 4 Power to awaken.

**[16:11]** You need to have

**[16:12]** your controlled Gate

**[16:13]** in an area

**[16:14]** with your Great Old One.

**[16:15]** You'll pay 4 Power

**[16:16]** and you'll place Tolcha

**[16:17]** in the area

**[16:18]** containing the Gate.

**[16:19]** And this Independent

**[16:20]** Great Old One

**[16:21]** only has 1 combat.

**[16:24]** The ability here

**[16:25]** is Undying Flame.

**[16:27]** It's in the

**[16:27]** Gather Power phase.

**[16:29]** The end of Gather Power phase,

**[16:30]** gain 1 doom

**[16:31]** if at least 1 faction

**[16:32]** has more doom than you,

**[16:34]** gain 1 Elder Sign

**[16:35]** if at least 1 faction

**[16:36]** has more Elder Signs

**[16:38]** than you,

**[16:38]** and gain 1 Power

**[16:40]** if at least 1 faction

**[16:41]** has more Power than you.

**[16:44]** Spellbook requirement

**[16:45]** for this Great Old One.

**[16:46]** As an action,

**[16:47]** each enemy faction

**[16:48]** earns 2 Power.

**[16:50]** And the Spellbook

**[16:51]** is Ceremony of Annihilation.

**[16:53]** It's in the doom phase.

**[16:55]** When you perform

**[16:56]** a Ritual of Annihilation,

**[16:57]** you may choose

**[16:58]** to pay nothing

**[16:58]** and instead earn Power

**[17:00]** equal to the current position

**[17:01]** of the Ritual of Annihilation marker.

**[17:03]** Then advance the marker

**[17:04]** by one step.

**[17:06]** You earn no extra doom points

**[17:07]** nor Elder Signs.

**[17:10]** This is a pretty cool

**[17:11]** Great Old One.

**[17:12]** This is kind of a

**[17:13]** catch-up mechanic,

**[17:14]** you could say.

**[17:15]** So it's doing nothing

**[17:16]** for you, basically,

**[17:17]** if you're the leader.

**[17:18]** Or, you know,

**[17:19]** mostly nothing.

**[17:20]** Maybe you'll gain Power

**[17:21]** off of it or something

**[17:22]** or maybe a doom.

**[17:24]** But this is going to be

**[17:24]** most useful to the player

**[17:26]** who's behind the other players

**[17:27]** and I really like that.

**[17:29]** You know,

**[17:29]** because people have

**[17:30]** different experience levels

**[17:31]** in Cthulhu Wars.

**[17:33]** I'm happy if the newer player

**[17:34]** ends up buying this

**[17:36]** and is, like,

**[17:36]** keeping pace with the other

**[17:37]** players who might have

**[17:38]** more experience

**[17:39]** because of the

**[17:40]** Undying Flame ability.

**[17:43]** This one's just

**[17:44]** generally useful.

**[17:45]** Even if you might have

**[17:46]** the most doom,

**[17:47]** you might not have

**[17:48]** the most Elder Signs.

**[17:49]** So for that reason,

**[17:50]** it doesn't need to be, like,

**[17:51]** exactly the person

**[17:52]** in last place

**[17:52]** taking this.

**[17:53]** You're going to be

**[17:54]** having a good time with this

**[17:55]** even if you're in, like,

**[17:56]** second place.

**[17:57]** Maybe you're getting

**[17:58]** an Elder Sign.

**[17:58]** Just getting the one Power

**[18:00]** from it is fine, too.

**[18:01]** But ideally,

**[18:02]** you can get all three

**[18:03]** and you're feeling

**[18:04]** pretty good about that.

**[18:05]** If you manage to get

**[18:06]** the doom and the Elder Sign

**[18:07]** from Undying Flame,

**[18:08]** you just got at least

**[18:10]** two doom for a

**[18:11]** four-cost Great Old One.

**[18:12]** I think that's really,

**[18:13]** really nice.

**[18:14]** If you manage to do that

**[18:15]** multiple turns in a row,

**[18:17]** wow, this has paid for itself,

**[18:18]** I think,

**[18:18]** maybe multiple times over.

**[18:22]** Spellbook requirement.

**[18:23]** Pretty trivial to do this

**[18:24]** as it's just an action.

**[18:26]** And you're giving away

**[18:27]** two Power to each enemy.

**[18:29]** Who cares?

**[18:30]** You actually spent

**[18:31]** zero Power doing this,

**[18:32]** so you kind of walk

**[18:33]** in place anyway.

**[18:34]** You're not really, like,

**[18:35]** on the back foot

**[18:36]** by giving away this Power.

**[18:39]** And as for the Spellbook,

**[18:41]** yeah, super catch-up mechanic.

**[18:43]** Not in terms of doom,

**[18:45]** but you could earn

**[18:46]** potentially a lot of Power

**[18:48]** using this.

**[18:49]** If you have a really bad turn,

**[18:51]** don't end on a lot of Gates.

**[18:53]** I think that's the best time

**[18:54]** for this ability

**[18:55]** because let's say

**[18:56]** the Ritual Marker

**[18:57]** is sitting at six or seven.

**[18:58]** You are only on one

**[18:59]** or two Gates anyway.

**[19:00]** You're kind of behind.

**[19:01]** Maybe you gain some stuff

**[19:03]** from Undying Flame.

**[19:05]** You make the Ritual

**[19:06]** more expensive

**[19:06]** for everybody else.

**[19:08]** And then you earn, like,

**[19:09]** six or seven Power.

**[19:10]** That's great.

**[19:11]** You can do all kinds of stuff

**[19:13]** with six or seven Power.

**[19:14]** That's, like,

**[19:14]** the Power to move

**[19:15]** and build a Gate.

**[19:17]** Do all kinds of shenanigans

**[19:18]** with capturing

**[19:19]** or whatever it is

**[19:19]** that your faction does.

**[19:21]** Just an all-around useful

**[19:22]** Spellbook, I would say.

**[19:25]** What factions like this one?

**[19:27]** Yeah, nobody in particular,

**[19:29]** or I should say

**[19:30]** everybody in particular,

**[19:31]** generally useful

**[19:32]** to all factions,

**[19:33]** I would say,

**[19:34]** unless you're completely

**[19:35]** in the lead

**[19:35]** and you're crushing,

**[19:37]** in which case

**[19:37]** the Undying Flame

**[19:38]** is not doing much for you.

**[19:39]** In every other case,

**[19:41]** if you're in the back

**[19:42]** of the pack,

**[19:42]** in the middle of the pack,

**[19:43]** you'll find Undying Flame

**[19:45]** to be very useful

**[19:46]** and you may also find

**[19:48]** a nice use

**[19:48]** for Ceremony of Annihilation.

**[19:51]** You can do some

**[19:52]** tricksy stuff with this,

**[19:53]** potentially toward

**[19:54]** the end of the game.

**[19:55]** If you go first

**[19:56]** in the turn order,

**[19:57]** you can make

**[19:58]** the Ritual Marker

**[19:59]** go up one.

**[20:01]** The cost of Rituals

**[20:02]** getting too expensive

**[20:02]** is definitely a real thing.

**[20:04]** You can get some Power,

**[20:06]** get some Doom,

**[20:07]** get another sign

**[20:08]** from Undying Flame

**[20:08]** and then deny

**[20:09]** somebody else a Ritual

**[20:10]** while giving yourself

**[20:11]** a bunch of Power.

**[20:12]** That seems like

**[20:13]** a pretty nice place to be.

**[20:14]** And I think that wraps up

**[20:18]** the rest of the

**[20:20]** Independent Great Old One

**[20:21]** pack four.

**[20:22]** So closing thoughts,

**[20:24]** wow, I highly recommend

**[20:25]** this one.

**[20:26]** I can't say enough

**[20:27]** good things about it.

**[20:28]** All these Great Old Ones

**[20:29]** are generally useful,

**[20:31]** so no matter what factions

**[20:33]** you and your playgroup

**[20:34]** like to play with,

**[20:35]** I think these will fit

**[20:36]** right in.

**[20:38]** I also don't think

**[20:38]** these are too complicated

**[20:40]** or hard to figure out

**[20:43]** what they do.

**[20:43]** They're all pretty

**[20:44]** straightforward

**[20:45]** and pretty good,

**[20:47]** so they'll pay for

**[20:48]** themselves right away.

**[20:49]** They all look really cool

**[20:50]** and I think they'll be

**[20:52]** useful to both

**[20:53]** newer players

**[20:54]** and advanced players

**[20:55]** alike.

**[20:57]** A+,

**[20:57]** definitely pick this one up

**[20:59]** if you happen to

**[21:01]** be interested in it.

**[21:04]** I think that's another

**[21:05]** episode in the book,

**[21:06]** so thank you very much

**[21:08]** for listening.
