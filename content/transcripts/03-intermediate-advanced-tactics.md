## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:23]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[00:26]** Hope you're all doing well.

**[00:28]** I'm doing pretty well myself.

**[00:30]** It's actually my birthday today.

**[00:31]** I just had a big slice of carrot cake.

**[00:34]** Carrot cake without raisins, mind you.

**[00:36]** I'm a big fan of carrot cake.

**[00:37]** Let me know what your favorite cake is.

**[00:40]** Anyway, today, this episode, I'm gonna continue in, I guess, part two of learning to play

**[00:47]** Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:48]** In part one, we covered the basics.

**[00:52]** Another way of putting it would be things that I would tell somebody the first time

**[00:56]** they were sitting down to play.

**[00:58]** In part two here, I want to revisit everything from the first episode.

**[01:03]** I mean, say, like, all the different actions that we can take, all the different phases

**[01:07]** of the game.

**[01:08]** We're gonna re-examine each of those things, but do it through a little bit of a different

**[01:13]** lens.

**[01:14]** This would be something for somebody who's maybe played 10 or 20 games of Cthulhu Wars,

**[01:20]** and you have a decent idea of all the factions and what's going on, but maybe you want to

**[01:24]** get a little bit deeper.

**[01:26]** If you're still really early on in your journey as a Cthulhu Wars player, by all means, feel

**[01:31]** free to listen to this, but if you've only played a few games, maybe listen to my other

**[01:36]** episode about how to play first, and then come back to this one, and I think hopefully

**[01:40]** it will be more meaningful for you.

**[01:43]** I want to just take a second to talk about Power as a whole.

**[01:47]** Well, maybe not just Power.

**[01:49]** There's different resources in Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:51]** We could all say Power is a resource, maybe the number of units you have is a resource,

**[01:57]** your doom total might be a resource in some way, however, there's an important resource

**[02:01]** that's not really written anywhere on any cards.

**[02:05]** Maybe Sleeper has the best example of this, but that resource is time.

**[02:10]** Taking your time doing things in Cthulhu Wars will really pay off.

**[02:15]** When I say that, I don't mean taking a long time and thinking carefully about what you're

**[02:20]** going to do before you do it.

**[02:22]** Don't mean that at all.

**[02:23]** In fact, if you've got a problem with that, I think you should probably start setting

**[02:26]** a timer for your group to keep them moving through the turn.

**[02:30]** What I mean is spending your Power slowly usually has some benefits.

**[02:36]** Doing whatever it is that you plan to do for the action phase, the important stuff, doing

**[02:40]** it as slowly as possible and not spending all of your Power.

**[02:45]** Sometimes you can't avoid spending all of your Power all at once, or in big chunks,

**[02:48]** but it's a good practice to do what it is you're going to do slowly to anticipate what

**[02:53]** the other players are going to do, but also to run people out of Power.

**[02:57]** So let's say, just as an example, you've had a really good turn as Black Goat or something.

**[03:03]** You start the next action phase and you're at 12 Power and you're like 4 Power up on

**[03:08]** all the other players.

**[03:10]** Some things that you might be thinking about doing at this point, aside from maybe ritualing,

**[03:14]** might be, well, you could maybe build another Gate if you've got a lot of Power.

**[03:18]** If you do that, you could do it right away, but that's going to give the other players

**[03:22]** a big signal of what your plans are, and then they can adjust themselves accordingly.

**[03:26]** So in that situation where you have more Power than the other players, maybe you want to

**[03:31]** consider taking the least expensive actions possible until you need to do otherwise.

**[03:38]** Basically what that's going to do is maintain your differential in Power over the other

**[03:44]** players.

**[03:45]** Let's assume everybody's taking one-cost actions.

**[03:48]** Maybe they're not.

**[03:49]** Maybe they're building Gates.

**[03:50]** Maybe they're summoning monsters.

**[03:51]** That's even better for you if you're doing this stalling.

**[03:53]** If everyone's taking one-cost actions and you're up by 4 Power on everybody else, that's

**[03:58]** like 4 Power worth of turns that the other players might not be able to do anything against

**[04:03]** you.

**[04:04]** So that's a really strong position to be in.

**[04:07]** Maybe they know what you're doing and they're going to try to stall as well to go as slowly

**[04:11]** as possible.

**[04:12]** They should be.

**[04:13]** Good players should be doing that.

**[04:15]** Sometimes just having that Power differential and maintaining that over the whole action

**[04:18]** phase is going to be really, really important.

**[04:21]** In that example, maybe we were going to plan to build a Gate, but if we can wait out the

**[04:25]** other players and we have 4 Power to play with when everyone else is out.

**[04:29]** Maybe I'm Black Goat and I just start avataring around.

**[04:32]** I start getting some extra spell books by moving.

**[04:35]** Now that I know nobody's going to be in the game to do anything about it.

**[04:39]** Of course, the math here changes a little bit if you've got High Priest in the game,

**[04:42]** but that's another episode.

**[04:45]** Let's talk about building Gates.

**[04:49]** Constructing a Gate.

**[04:50]** You're going to have to do this at least a couple of times in a game.

**[04:53]** You should know that when you build a Gate, it's expensive.

**[04:57]** It's one of the more expensive things that you can do.

**[04:59]** And that Gate is not going to pay for itself until a couple turns worth of it providing

**[05:04]** you Power.

**[05:05]** Let's say we build a Gate in one action phase.

**[05:08]** We spent 3 Power to do that.

**[05:10]** In the subsequent gather Power phase, we're going to get 2 Power for the controlled Gate.

**[05:16]** So we spent 3 on it, we've gotten 2 back.

**[05:19]** It's not really going to pay for itself until the following gather Power where you will

**[05:23]** have gotten Power 3 and 4 from holding onto it.

**[05:27]** That's assuming nothing bad happens.

**[05:29]** It's expensive to construct a Gate and it's generally cheaper to steal the Gate from other

**[05:35]** players.

**[05:36]** If you're able to plan your moves accordingly to steal Gates, I definitely think that is

**[05:43]** the thing you want to be doing.

**[05:45]** I think just generally being passive versus being aggressive and doing something like

**[05:50]** that to somebody.

**[05:51]** The aggressive thing I think pays off the most, even if it may buy you some ill will

**[05:57]** with one or more players at the table.

**[05:59]** I think it's worth doing.

**[06:01]** Maybe another thing to say about that is try to figure out what kind of game it's going

**[06:05]** to be.

**[06:06]** Are players going for early Gates?

**[06:08]** Is everyone trying to build multiple Gates?

**[06:11]** Or is it going to be a low resource game where there's not going to be that many Gates that

**[06:16]** are built and the players are just going to be fighting over those Gates the entire game?

**[06:20]** I've seen games where opener's in the game and opener just doesn't even get their sixth

**[06:25]** Spellbook because nobody's building Gates.

**[06:28]** Everybody's too caught up in fighting for control of the only Gates that there are available.

**[06:33]** And that's because everyone's just trying to scrap for every single Power.

**[06:37]** You should try to figure that out if it's going to be a high resource game or a low

**[06:40]** resource game.

**[06:41]** Try to play accordingly.

**[06:42]** And of course, that can shift as the game goes on.

**[06:47]** Build your Gates accordingly or decide not to and decide to steal them if you think that

**[06:52]** there's not going to be a lot of Gates being built in that game.

**[06:56]** While we're on the topic of Gates, let's talk about defending a Gate.

**[07:00]** In the last episode, we went over the key concept of if you have a Gate and you have

**[07:05]** a monster, you are protected from capture against enemy monsters.

**[07:09]** And then great old ones are going to guard against other great old ones, but the monster

**[07:14]** does not guard against capture from the great old one.

**[07:17]** With that in mind, a person might think like, oh, okay, well, every Gate I should try to

**[07:23]** strive for, it has to have a Cultist, it has to have a monster, it has to have a great

**[07:28]** old one, ideally, then it's protected from everything.

**[07:31]** But you should really think about when you are deciding how you're going to defend your

**[07:36]** Gates, think about the other Power that the other players have and maybe what they're

**[07:40]** capable of as well.

**[07:42]** Do they have enough Power to actually get over to you and capture you is one thing you

**[07:45]** might want to consider.

**[07:46]** You can definitely get away with building a Gate that has no monster guarding it.

**[07:51]** If the other players are out of Power, nobody can stop you, right?

**[07:55]** Another thing you might consider doing is stacking up more than one acolyte on a Gate.

**[08:02]** Let's think about a Gate that has just two acolytes on it and nothing else.

**[08:06]** Well, again, if somebody marches in with a monster, maybe they can then spend one other

**[08:11]** Power and battle you away, but it might actually cost them two Power to actually take that

**[08:17]** Gate from you.

**[08:18]** And that is a little bit expensive, starting to get expensive.

**[08:21]** So figure that they move in, maybe they have a one combat monster.

**[08:25]** If they move in and you have nothing, they still need to spend two Power to steal the

**[08:28]** Gate and that's kind of rough.

**[08:30]** They spent three Power...

**[08:32]** in order to take that Gate from you, it's almost as expensive of them just building a Gate themselves.

**[08:37]** So that can actually be a pretty good deterrent depending on the unit that's moving in to capture you.

**[08:42]** Three acolytes on a Gate is pretty nice.

**[08:46]** Unless somebody battles you away, it's gonna cost them four Power to take the Gate.

**[08:50]** Yes, they're gonna get some Power by capturing you, of course, and it might be worth it for them in that specific situation.

**[08:55]** But just know that defending your Gate, there's more than one way to do it.

**[08:59]** You don't need to have a ton of monsters there.

**[09:02]** Another thing about the multiple acolytes on a Gate is just dreams.

**[09:07]** You're playing around dreams, not even trying to, but you're like thwarting Cthulhu from just getting an easy Gate with dreams.

**[09:14]** It's just good practice to build or recruit multiple acolytes on your Gates.

**[09:21]** One last thing on Gates. Maybe we should talk about how many Gates is like a good amount.

**[09:27]** What I mean is, are you doing well if you have X number of Gates?

**[09:31]** I think everybody knows if you're on maybe five Gates, you're doing pretty well for yourself.

**[09:37]** You're probably gonna reach, well, maybe winning the game at that point.

**[09:40]** Obviously, zero, bad. We don't ever want to be on zero Gates if we can help it.

**[09:44]** One Gate can be bad depending on the position that we're in, usually pretty bad.

**[09:49]** You're gonna be normally capped at around eight Power with one Gate.

**[09:53]** Two Gates, I would actually argue is pretty decent if you're in a close game and all the players are

**[10:00]** punching each other and everyone's on two Gates or

**[10:04]** three Gates, you're actually doing pretty well for yourself.

**[10:07]** Ten Power, you know, not the best, but enough to work with. Again, when we talk about our

**[10:14]** staggering your actions and spending our Power slowly, ten Power is actually a lot. If you're taking one-cost actions,

**[10:20]** you can really stall and be hanging with the other players that might have a little bit more Power than you.

**[10:25]** Maybe they're doing something more expensive and you can still get away with doing some meaningful actions,

**[10:30]** even though you have less Power than them. Anything above three Gates where you're at 12 Power,

**[10:34]** I'd say you're doing actively good. If you can ever end the round on three Gates,

**[10:38]** I'm pretty happy. If I have one great old one, that's maybe me considering ritualing on three. You're gonna have enough Power to

**[10:47]** spend on pretty much any costed ritual and you're gonna get at least three doom, probably an Elder Sign.

**[10:53]** That's like a six and a half, seven doom, eight doom swing in one turn.

**[10:58]** Some factions you might not even want to allow them to be on two Gates, like Cho-Cho and even Yellow Sign.

**[11:03]** Them being on two Gates is actually very scary. Two Gates is plenty.

**[11:08]** Obviously, if you're gonna win the game, go for three, four, and five Gates.

**[11:11]** But otherwise, maybe you don't want to draw the heat onto yourself.

**[11:15]** You can safely hang out on two or three Gates and just keep your doom tempo going and win the game.

**[11:22]** Recruiting an acolyte. That's another action we can talk about.

**[11:26]** You're not going to be able to take this action unless you have acolytes in your pool, obviously.

**[11:30]** They're gonna get into your pool in various ways. They're either gonna get captured by other players. They might get battled away.

**[11:36]** I'm here to tell you after playing many games of Cthulhu Wars,

**[11:40]** you should really start thinking about having acolytes in your pool and the benefits that that can provide you.

**[11:46]** You can recruit an acolyte anywhere that you have a unit.

**[11:49]** So it can be very beneficial sometimes to have one or two hanging out in your pool.

**[11:54]** Maybe they got captured in the last action phase. Maybe that was by design.

**[11:58]** The subsequent action phase, maybe you can move in and start battling people out of the way of a Gate.

**[12:05]** Maybe that's pretty remote from where a lot of your other units are.

**[12:08]** Well, you've got an acolyte in your pool.

**[12:10]** You can recruit it right then and there.

**[12:12]** And then you've got a new

**[12:13]** acolyte that you didn't have to move across the map. If you have to move an acolyte multiple times to get to your Gate,

**[12:18]** that doesn't feel great. Sometimes you need to do it. Most of the time, you're not gonna want to do that.

**[12:24]** It's pretty expensive to move your units.

**[12:26]** So think about your acolytes, getting them in and out of your pool through various means.

**[12:31]** Some factions are gonna have an easier time doing that than others. I'm thinking about Black Goat with Blood Sacrifice, Cthulhu with

**[12:39]** Absorb and Devolve.

**[12:42]** Obviously at the end of the action phase,

**[12:43]** you're gonna want to get them all out if you can, as many as you can, because they're gonna provide you Power.

**[12:48]** But there is some utility to have an acolyte in your pool, and that's just food for thought.

**[12:55]** Okay, summoning a monster. I don't have much to say about this action, Summon Monster.

**[13:01]** Kind of tailing on that idea of staggering your Power.

**[13:04]** You may not want to summon your most expensive monster at a certain point in time,

**[13:09]** only because you want to do it as one of the last things that you do. Don't let everybody know

**[13:13]** that's what you're gonna do right off the bat, is kind of all I have to say about that.

**[13:17]** Maybe another rule of thumb, and I may have said this in the other episode,

**[13:21]** maybe if you're gonna summon a monster, avoid summoning a monster that you are not

**[13:26]** currently have the Spellbook for, or

**[13:28]** or

**[13:30]** maybe it's, I have that the other way around,

**[13:32]** when you're taking Spellbooks that have to do with your monsters,

**[13:35]** don't take a Spellbook that doesn't correspond to a monster that you don't already have in play, or

**[13:41]** are not planning on getting into play in the very near future.

**[13:46]** That's just gonna prevent you from taking Spellbooks that feel kind of blah. A good example would be like, if you're playing Cthulhu,

**[13:52]** if you don't have any Shoggoths, don't even bother getting

**[13:57]** Absorb until your last book. If you're not gonna have any Shoggoths on the battlefield, you're not gonna plan to Absorb.

**[14:03]** Just don't do it. It's not worth it.

**[14:06]** You can always pivot and lean into it a little later when you get your Spellbooks,

**[14:10]** and you get all six, and you're online, and you're doing your thing.

**[14:13]** Let's see, one other thing in the

**[14:16]** action phase would be Awakening a Great Old One.

**[14:18]** I don't have that much to add to this either, but one thing would be

**[14:23]** think about when you plan to get your Great Old One out.

**[14:27]** Most factions are gonna try to get them out action phase two.

**[14:31]** There's a few cheaper ones that can get got in action phase one.

**[14:35]** There's a few factions that have multiple Great Old Ones. They're gonna have to get them over action phases two through four.

**[14:41]** You don't always need to get your Great Old One on turn two.

**[14:45]** There's some shenanigans you might be able to get away with. I think generally it's the thing to do.

**[14:50]** Let me think about Crawling Chaos and Cthulhu.

**[14:54]** On action phase two, you probably want to get them out 90% of the time,

**[14:58]** but if you don't, you actually have a lot of Power to play around and do some kind of shenanigans.

**[15:04]** Just food for thought.

**[15:05]** You can get more Gates doing this because other players are gonna take a turn off.

**[15:09]** You may be able to actually get yourself more doom and more Power and be able to still awaken your Great Old One in

**[15:15]** maybe action phase three,

**[15:17]** just with some extra Power left over to do stuff with. One example might be Yellow Sign.

**[15:23]** Yeah, getting Hastur turn two is pretty nice, but you can also

**[15:27]** get one or two more Gates and then the following turn get Hastur and still have four Power to do something else if you need to.

**[15:34]** That can be handy. I'm not here to say it's right or wrong to always get your Great Old One in

**[15:41]** action phase two or as early as possible, but let's say

**[15:44]** 85% of the time, get it as early as possible. The other 15-10% of the time,

**[15:51]** you can probably

**[15:53]** do something cheeky instead.

**[15:56]** Let's talk about battling. First thing, let's talk about

**[16:00]** fighting battles effectively. When I say that, I mean a few things. Don't fight battles that are not gonna be

**[16:08]** profitable for you.

**[16:10]** Power is a resource you'd never want to waste in this game,

**[16:13]** so if you're gonna fight somebody, make sure you're doing it for a good reason. If they just have a random

**[16:18]** monster and there's no Gate and you have a random monster in the area, just don't ever declare a battle there.

**[16:25]** It's not worth it. Maybe if it's a super valuable monster like a formless spawn or something,

**[16:30]** maybe you can consider it,

**[16:31]** but you don't really want to fight in areas where there are not juicy targets like Gates or Great Old Ones.

**[16:37]** Let's say we know our battle that we want to fight in now, but let's talk about maybe what's safe in a battle.

**[16:44]** We know that the Battle Dice in Cthulhu Wars, they have two pains and they have one kill.

**[16:51]** So three blank sides, only a 1 in 6 chance of rolling a kill, and then a 1 in 3 chance of rolling a pain.

**[16:58]** You're really not guaranteed to roll a lot of kills, so definitely think about

**[17:04]** that when you're trying to figure out how many dice you want to roll to kill

**[17:07]** something. If you're gonna try to kill like one high-value target, maybe it's

**[17:12]** like a great old one and a acolyter hanging out, you might want to bring like

**[17:17]** eight or ten dice just to like really make sure you get at least one juicy

**[17:21]** kill. Even ten dice I don't feel great about rolling two kills on, but if you've

**[17:26]** played this game at all you know the dice sometimes have a mind of their own.

**[17:30]** Sometimes you can roll really well, sometimes you can roll really poorly, and

**[17:33]** that's just probability happening. You can't control it. So we want to try to

**[17:40]** roll as many dice as possible, but let's think about what is a safe battle. Maybe

**[17:46]** the math we want to apply here is something like every five dice in the

**[17:51]** battle you might want to have an extra unit. You don't want to take these

**[17:55]** engagements with your great old one if they're by themselves. You want to put

**[17:59]** more bodies in to make sure that your expensive units get spared and get

**[18:03]** paned away instead of getting killed. We should talk about panes. Panes are

**[18:09]** paning you to an adjacent area. They're not kills, but they will make you leave

**[18:14]** the area that you're in. Yes, the panes are good for still getting results on

**[18:19]** your combat dice and doing something about the units that are in the area or

**[18:22]** the Gate that you want, but another way that you can think about panes, and I'm

**[18:26]** going to throw a big asterisk here, and I mean this only if crawling chaos is

**[18:31]** not in the game or they are in the game and they have full cooperation with you

**[18:36]** and they don't have madness, something like that. Madness is gonna make

**[18:40]** everything I'm about to say not true. If there's no madness in the game, you

**[18:44]** should start to think about panes like what they truly are, which is actually

**[18:49]** free movement. Dramatic pause. If you get to pane your units where you want to, you

**[18:56]** can start setting up engagements where you do want them to roll a bunch of dice

**[19:01]** against you because you're planning on getting your units paned to go to a

**[19:04]** different area afterward. Let's say you bring a bunch of acolytes, a couple

**[19:09]** acolytes into the battle with you and you are fighting a great old one. Your

**[19:13]** acolytes get killed, everything else gets killed except your great old one. You get

**[19:17]** to pane yourself into an adjacent area. Maybe there's another player that you

**[19:20]** didn't fight with. Now you're in their area. Maybe they're out of Power. Well, you

**[19:25]** got to move into their area for free. You're gonna be able to recruit into

**[19:28]** their area because you have your great old one there. Even worse is when you

**[19:33]** have unlimited combat, the pane becomes very, very scary. If the players know what

**[19:39]** they're doing, you can set up an engagement where you fight in one area,

**[19:44]** get paned to another area, immediately declare another battle because you have

**[19:47]** unlimited battle. I've seen a chain of Kreek of Thulu or some other faction

**[19:52]** like a Wind Walker pane two or three times and fight two or three players in

**[19:56]** one turn. Yeah, not too much else to say on battle here. Just be aware of the

**[20:03]** train of pane that can come either from you or if you're gonna be on the

**[20:09]** receiving end, just be aware. Once people have unlimited combat, that ability to

**[20:14]** fight multiple people in one turn and really like decimate the board if you've

**[20:18]** got a big scary death ball of Wind Walker units or Cthulhu units, it's on

**[20:23]** the table there. So I think we've covered revisiting the action phase in pretty

**[20:29]** good detail at this point, so I'm gonna do a similar thing to my last episode

**[20:33]** Learn to Play where I'm gonna go back and revisit the gather Power phase, first

**[20:39]** player phase, doom phase. I don't have a ton to say about those phases again

**[20:43]** because most of the game takes place in the action phase. Going back to gather

**[20:48]** Power phase, so there's not too much else to say about this one. Everything I said

**[20:52]** about Gates applies here. You're doing okay if you're on two Gates. Obviously

**[20:56]** you want to be on as many Gates as possible. The one interesting thing to

**[21:00]** mention around this time in the game would be the determined first player

**[21:04]** phase. My only thing to say here when revisiting is just think a little bit

**[21:10]** more carefully about the direction that you're going to make the play proceed in

**[21:15]** during the doom phase and the action phase. There is like a little bit of

**[21:19]** advantage to be gained there, like suppose somebody's in a delicate

**[21:23]** position and you're not their friend. It could be a nice thing for you to just be

**[21:27]** able to make the person that's most in the position to punish that player go

**[21:33]** before them in the action phase. Something as simple as that or maybe

**[21:37]** you're toward the end of the game and the players have all been heavily

**[21:40]** performing rituals of annihilation. If that's happening and you choose the turn

**[21:45]** order correctly, you might be able to just deny somebody a ritual at the end

**[21:48]** of the game. Maybe because they got boardwiped, they won't be able to afford

**[21:53]** the expense of ritual if you make the order of play go in a certain direction.

**[21:58]** Yes, so moving on to the doom phase. There's not a ton here, but we want to

**[22:06]** just start thinking about our games and mapping them out over time, like when do

**[22:11]** we actually want to ritual and when do we want to hold back. Of course you're

**[22:16]** gaining a lot of doom from your Gates the more that you have. Depending on

**[22:20]** where you're at with your collecting your six spell books, that's gonna more

**[22:26]** inform when you're really going all-in on ritualing. If you've got all of

**[22:29]** your spell books and you're creeping up into 20 plus doom, I think that's a good

**[22:35]** reason to just be ritualing. If it doesn't put you in a terrible

**[22:39]** position, ritualing with one great old one and several Gates is gonna hopefully

**[22:43]** put you in striking distance of winning the game outright. Maybe more important

**[22:49]** for this doom phase section of this guide is when to not ritual. When would I

**[22:54]** advise against ritualing? That would be in these cases where you don't have all

**[22:59]** your spell books. It could be really tempting if you're on four Gates to

**[23:03]** ritual, but if you don't have all your spell books, you really don't want to end

**[23:07]** the game with without all your spell books ever. I consider that like the

**[23:10]** biggest humiliation in Thule Wars, so really really want to get those books

**[23:15]** before you decide to ritual. Basically what we want to figure out is, aside

**[23:22]** from your spell books, we don't want to ritual when maybe that Power can be

**[23:27]** better spent, like suppressing the other players and really solidifying your

**[23:32]** hold over the game. What I mean by that is suppose you had a really good round

**[23:36]** last round. You started this action phase with like four Gates or

**[23:40]** something. You're on 14 Power. That's great. You've probably got more Power

**[23:44]** than the other players and you could ritual and maybe you're at parity with

**[23:48]** them and you've got up a little bit of doom, but that will put a target on your

**[23:51]** back and what I'm recommending you can do instead, which I will often do, is just

**[23:57]** use that Power to stay ahead of them. They're gonna run out of Power before

**[24:01]** you. You're gonna be able to snowball your advantage even further when people

**[24:05]** don't have the Power to defend their Gates. So just because you passed up on a

**[24:09]** ritual does not really mean you're passing up on a lot of value. You can use

**[24:16]** that same Power you're gonna spend on a ritual to get value in other ways,

**[24:20]** whether that's by maintaining or expanding the number of Gates you have,

**[24:24]** or by using that Power to snipe other people's great old ones so that they

**[24:30]** really can't do anything against you in the following action phase. I think

**[24:34]** that's all I really have to say for the rest of this episode, which is the

**[24:39]** intermediate to advanced tactics for Cthulhu Wars. Hopefully you got

**[24:44]** something out of this. If you're a newer player, hopefully I've explained

**[24:47]** something here that you didn't think about before or didn't realize before

**[24:51]** and that you find this guide a little bit useful. So with that being said, we're

**[24:56]** done here. Thanks for listening. You can find me on

**[25:00]** Discord at Kilogram. Send me a message, I'd love to hear from you. Until then,

**[25:05]** good day, good morning, good night, wherever it is that you are. Bye!
