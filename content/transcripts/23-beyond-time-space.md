## Transcript

**[00:00]** There, on a tombstone of 1768 stolen from the granary burying ground in Boston, sat the Ghoul

**[00:07]** which was once the artist Richard Upton Pickman. It was naked in rubbery and had acquired so much

**[00:14]** of the Ghoulish physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure, but it still remembered a

**[00:20]** little English and was able to converse with Carter in grunts and monosyllables, helped out

**[00:25]** now and then by the gibbering of Ghouls. When it learned that Carter wished to get to the Enchanted

**[00:30]** Wood and from there to the city of Celeface in Uth-Nargai beyond the Tenarion Hills, it seemed

**[00:37]** rather doubtful, for these Ghouls of the waking world do no business in the graveyards of the

**[00:42]** upper dreamland, leaving that to the web-footed whomps that are spawned in dead cities, and many

**[00:48]** things intervene betwixt their gulf in the Enchanted Wood, including the terrible kingdom of the Gugs.

**[00:55]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:17]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host. Hope you're doing well. I'm recording a pair of episodes

**[01:25]** before work, hopefully. My week's off to a great start, I guess. I guess you could say I had a

**[01:31]** really good weekend. I saw my favorite band, Queens of the Stone Age, the other day. It was excellent.

**[01:37]** The opening acts were also pretty excellent. They caught me off guard with how excellent they are.

**[01:43]** The Armed from Detroit, I think. I don't even know what I would call them, like,

**[01:49]** punk, like, muddlecore? Not sure. Nobody knows the identity of these people, I guess. I've tried to

**[01:56]** look them up on the internet, and they might have, like, a rotating lineup. Anyway, extremely hardcore

**[02:01]** band. Their energy was very intense. They had a vision, and they executed on it, so good for them.

**[02:09]** There was also Phantagram, which was kind of, like, more of a, I don't know, synth-y thing, but they both

**[02:17]** sounded really good, so recommend both. Check them out. And obviously, Queens is great. My favorite band,

**[02:22]** so if you don't know, now you know. What are we talking about today? We are covering the neutral

**[02:29]** expansion Beyond Space and Time, which contains two neutral monsters and one neutral terror that you

**[02:37]** can include in your games of Cthulhu Wars. Quick recap on neutrals. Monsters and terrors, you're going

**[02:44]** to buy them during the doom phase. Monsters are going to have to pay two doom to summon one, and

**[02:50]** terrors are going to have to pay two doom and two Power to summon. And once you do, they're going to

**[02:56]** stick with you for the rest of the game. You can consider them, like, an extension of your unit pool.

**[03:01]** Our first unit we have to discuss is the Womp. And you heard a little bit in the intro there from

**[03:11]** the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath. As far as I know, that's the only place the Womps get mentioned is

**[03:16]** just in the one sentence, so very deep cut by PG for mentioning this one, so good on them. Sculpt looks

**[03:24]** kind of disgusting. It just kind of looks like a nasty spidery, I don't even know, kind of a spidery

**[03:33]** monkey looking thing almost. It's got plenty of arms, it's got a nasty looking mouth. I wouldn't want to

**[03:40]** stumble across one of these. They're very gross looking. To summon Womps, you will pay two doom

**[03:49]** points to obtain their loyalty card, and then you choose an enemy to place all four Womps in the pool

**[03:54]** in any area or areas without a Gate. They cost one to summon, and they have a combat of zero.

**[04:05]** The ability on Womps is Crypt Dweller. It's in the doom phase. Choose an enemy to place all Womps

**[04:11]** from your pool into any area or areas without a Gate. You may still summon Womps normally.

**[04:18]** Note that this ability does not say this is not optional, so you can opt out of this if you want to.

**[04:26]** Why do I say that? This is a very puzzling neutral unit, if I'm being honest. If you choose an opponent

**[04:34]** to help you with this one, they really need to be your ally. Otherwise, they might just be putting all

**[04:39]** your Womps into, like, random area. It's worse than that. They can split them into different areas if

**[04:46]** they want to. So for that alone, I think this is a very strange and very much less than useful

**[04:53]** neutral monster. Totally the value is dependent on whether or not someone's willing to cooperate with

**[05:00]** you to put Womps into an area of your choice. You can't even put them into a Gated area, which is very

**[05:07]** unfortunate, right? Gates are mainly what makes areas valuable in Cthulhu War, so this one's very

**[05:13]** strange. Right off the bat, when you buy this, you're going to need to choose an enemy. Hopefully that

**[05:20]** enemy is your friend and they just kind of take pity on you because you actually bought the Womps for some

**[05:25]** reason, and hopefully they're being nice and they put all four Womps into one area, and then, I don't

**[05:33]** know, you can recruit and build a Gate there, and wow, you have four monsters and an acolyte there.

**[05:39]** That's still not great. You're going to have to probably spend four Power to do all that, and

**[05:44]** you're really not scaring off any great old ones because the Womps have no combat there, and like,

**[05:49]** really not a threat. Yikes. This could be maybe the worst neutral unit, I think.

**[05:57]** What factions like this? Honestly, only Great Cthulhu even really wants this, and again, big

**[06:05]** asterisk, you're going to need somebody to, like, be your friend. You're going to actually want to be,

**[06:10]** like, talking to somebody before you ever buy this as Great Cthulhu and be like, hey,

**[06:15]** put the Womps in the ocean because I'm going to scoop them up with some merge, and I'm going to punch

**[06:20]** the crap out of somebody with absorb later. That's, like, the only real use case I can see for these,

**[06:27]** if you can think of something else, definitely let me know. I would love to find out how to make this

**[06:32]** more useful, but honestly, it's just not worth the two doom. Like, I don't see how these pay for

**[06:37]** themselves. If this is the last thing in the neutral pool everyone else has bought something from,

**[06:43]** I'm just, like, straight up not buying a neutral. If this is my only choice, I don't even want these

**[06:48]** ones, so. Yikes. It's, like, my most critical review of a neutral unit to date, I think. I would not

**[06:54]** like to buy this, really, for any reason. Even if I'm playing Great Cthulhu, I think we talked about

**[07:00]** the Ghasts in the Dreamlands Underworld expansion. I would much rather have the Ghasts if I'm playing

**[07:07]** Great Cthulhu because I have control over where they go. It's just such a hindrance. Like, why does

**[07:13]** the enemy get to split? They can even split them. If you're not friends with somebody, I just don't see

**[07:18]** them ever doing you any favors for this, other than out of pity, which I don't think that's a great

**[07:23]** place to be in Cthulhu Wars. Let's move on to our next neutral unit. The ground sloped upward toward

**[07:32]** the foot of Negranic, thinly covered with scrub oaks and ash trees, and strewn with bits of rock,

**[07:39]** lava, and ancient cinder. There were the charred embers of many camps where the lava gatherers were

**[07:45]** wont to stop, and several rude altars which they had built to propitiate their great old ones or to

**[07:51]** ward off what they dreamed of in Negranic's high passes and labyrinthine caves. At evening, Carter

**[07:59]** reached the farthest pile of embers and camped for the night, tethering his zebra to a sapling and

**[08:05]** wrapping himself well in his blanket before going to sleep. And all through the night, a vooneth howled

**[08:11]** distantly from the shore of some hidden pool. But Carter felt no fear of that amphibious terror,

**[08:17]** since he had been told with certainty that not one of them dares even approach the slopes of Negranic.

**[08:25]** Yes, our second unit to discuss is the Vuneth, another random monster from the Dreamlands that

**[08:34]** seemingly is only mentioned here just the once in the dream quest from Unknown Kadath.

**[08:39]** This one looks very snake-like, does look amphibious, it's got like a little bit of like a frog-lizard

**[08:48]** looking face, and a couple of arms and just kind of like a serpentine body looks like it's great at

**[08:55]** swimming through the water. Looks kind of friendly, looks a little bit goofy, honestly.

**[09:01]** To summon the vooneth, you're going to have to pay two doom points in the doom phase to obtain their

**[09:06]** loyalty card, and then you place one vooneth at one of your controlled Gates. There's two of them in the

**[09:11]** pool, they cost three, and they have a combat of one. The ability on vooneth is vicious. It's a post-battle

**[09:18]** ability. For each kill you score fewer than the number of vooneths involved in the battle, add one kill.

**[09:25]** So if you were to have two in the battle, for example, and you roll one kill, you're going to

**[09:31]** add an extra kill because there are two vooneths in the battle. If you rolled no kills, you get to

**[09:35]** add two kills if there were two vooneths. Cool. You only get two vooneths in the pool, so I guess

**[09:41]** they're good at defending Gates where you're not rolling a lot of dice, but their ability is only

**[09:47]** going to trigger when you don't roll kills, so I don't think that they're a great addition to

**[09:51]** a death ball. They're also pretty costly to summon at three Power, so you really want to avoid getting

**[09:58]** these killed if at all possible. What factions like these? A death ball, a mobile force, like a

**[10:06]** crawling chaos. Yes, they can move the vooneths around and get them into position. Maybe they can

**[10:10]** use them to protect some of their tertiary Gates, but if you're rolling dice, you're probably not

**[10:18]** triggering vicious that much, right? So for that reason, I think the factions that don't roll a lot

**[10:25]** of dice are going to make the most use of this. Maybe a chocho, maybe a demon saltant tends to have

**[10:31]** a lot of Gates with not a lot of dice protecting them. Those could both be potentially some good

**[10:36]** options here. Again, I don't want to be hypercritical of the neutral units, but this is another one that's

**[10:42]** like a little bit of a weird one to me. Seems generally like a worse version of the Langspiders

**[10:49]** from the Dreamlands ability that kind of like augments your combat. These just don't work well

**[10:56]** if you are rolling a lot of dice, and that is a bit strange to me. Maybe you can make some use of them

**[11:02]** on defense, and I'm definitely curious if you have any stories about using these effectively.

**[11:09]** I've never seen this one in a game, or if I have seen it in a game, I've not seen anybody buy it,

**[11:16]** because I generally don't think they're worth the two doom.

**[11:22]** Now we're moving on to our last unit to discuss, and that is the Hound of Tyndalos.

**[11:30]** Men awaken them cosmic hungers. We've escaped momentarily from the foulness that rings them

**[11:36]** round. They thirst for that in us which is clean, which emerged from the deed without stain.

**[11:43]** There is a part of us which did not partake in the deed, and that they hate. But do not imagine

**[11:49]** that they are literally, prosaically evil. They are beyond good and evil as we know it.

**[11:55]** They are that which in the beginning fell away from cleanliness. Through the deed, they became bodies of

**[12:00]** death, receptacles of all foulness. But they're not evil in our sense, because in the spheres through

**[12:07]** which they move, there's no thought, no morals, no right or wrong as we understand it. There's merely

**[12:15]** the pure and the foul. The foul expresses itself through angles, the pure through curves. Man,

**[12:21]** the pure part of him, is descended from a curve. This one looks awesome. The sculpt is giving me

**[12:32]** major like dog crossed with a xenomorph vibe, and I am here for it. My particular one is maybe a bit

**[12:41]** warped in a way that the clawed hand of the Tyndalos is reaching out past the base, and it's kind of like

**[12:47]** propping itself up. It almost looks like it's like surfing on like a skimboard or something.

**[12:54]** But yeah, it looks very scary. I love it. Big, thin, spindly arms, a really nasty, large mouth,

**[13:02]** and a tongue. Definitely looks like a dog. Definitely looks very fast. Would not want to cross one of

**[13:08]** these. Stay out of your home, I guess, where you have the corners and the angled walls. That's where

**[13:14]** you're in danger from these. Stay outside, I guess. The Hound of Tyndalos is a terror, so in order to

**[13:20]** summon it, you'll have to pay two doom and two Power in the doom phase to obtain their loyalty card.

**[13:26]** Then you place the Hound at any Gate, even one you don't control. This unit costs four and has a

**[13:33]** combat of four. There are two abilities on the Hound. Chronophage, ongoing. The Hound cannot perform

**[13:41]** the move action by itself. The Hound moves for free whenever you move any other unit. In doing so,

**[13:48]** the Hound teleports directly from an area with a Gate to another area with a Gate, neither of which

**[13:53]** need to be controlled by you or anyone. And the other ability, angles of time, ongoing. The Hound

**[14:02]** cannot be assigned a kill in battle. Wow. However, if a Hound is ever in an area without a Gate,

**[14:08]** due to being pained in such an area, or the Gate itself being destroyed or removed, etc.,

**[14:13]** it's eliminated. It can also be eliminated if it cannot be pained due to enemy presence in adjacent

**[14:20]** areas. So like being surrounded, the normal rules about pains. I think this is an awesome, awesome

**[14:28]** unit. First thing, it doesn't move around by itself, but it will move with any of your other units. So

**[14:34]** probably you're saving Power whenever you need to move somewhere else. You can also move the Hound.

**[14:42]** That's great. And not only does it move for free, it only moves through hopefully those valuable areas

**[14:49]** because it can only go to areas with Gates. That's really, really nice. Even the remotest Gates are

**[14:55]** not at all safe from the Hound because it's like whatever, non-Euclidean. It can travel anywhere.

**[15:02]** It's not bound by the normal laws of space and time, so it can pop up anywhere, which is awesome.

**[15:09]** Not only that, it's great at taking out any units at those remote Gates because it rolls four combat

**[15:15]** dice. So hopefully, even by itself, it can just push out a few of the units that are hanging out on a Gate

**[15:22]** and leave that Gate to you. The other great thing, it can't be assigned a kill in a battle. So if you did

**[15:28]** randomly fight a Gate with a Deep One and nothing else, that Deep One's not going to just get a

**[15:34]** cheeky kill and kill your four-cost terror, that's not going to happen. So this unit's great at pushing

**[15:41]** things away and it's not easily killed. However, you're going to need to be really careful about

**[15:46]** where you move this to and where you choose to fight or think about where somebody might fight you

**[15:52]** with the Hound, right? You need to be able to pain into an adjacent area with a Gate if at all possible.

**[16:00]** Keep that in mind. I would straight up maybe not consider moving this at all if you end up moving

**[16:06]** to, let's say, we move to a random Gate with some monsters that roll three dice. Even that is very

**[16:14]** sus if there's not a Gate adjacent for you to get pain to. Be careful, as long as you follow that rule

**[16:22]** of like never moving this unless it's into a Gated area that has another Gate adjacent to it,

**[16:28]** you're probably going to be doing a lot of work with this thing.

**[16:33]** What factions like this? I would say really any faction is going to enjoy this. I think even the

**[16:40]** defensive factions, assuming they have accolade in their pool, they can make some use out of this

**[16:45]** just popping up at a random Gate they want to claim for themselves before the end of the action

**[16:49]** phase. That could be great. Obviously it's going to be awesome alongside any sort of death ball,

**[16:57]** Windwalker, Cthulhu, crawling chaos. It's going to love to just pop up at any Gate that they want to

**[17:03]** pop up at and fight some great old ones. If it's got other units alongside it, that's awesome.

**[17:09]** It won't need to be assigned a pain, and in that sense like you need to care less about where you

**[17:15]** pop up with this. If you have other units to absorb the results of the battle and the hound is not

**[17:20]** getting pained at all, great. Then it's working out really well. This one I do think is worth the cost

**[17:27]** of the two doom because it's just so mobile and it's going to allow you to claim hopefully multiple

**[17:33]** Gates and it will pay for itself really quickly. Assuming you're able to keep it alive for maybe

**[17:38]** multiple action phases.

**[17:42]** And I think that's it for this Beyond Space and Time expansion. I'll give you my closing thoughts.

**[17:49]** Bit of a weird one, honestly. This feels a little bit like leftovers from things that could have been

**[17:56]** included in the Dreamlands Monsters expansion but didn't for some reason, and they just kind of

**[18:01]** stapled it together with the hound, which could have been standalone, maybe could have been included with

**[18:08]** the Cosmic Terrors. I'm not really sure what's going on there, but I'm very middling on this one.

**[18:14]** I would say like the MVP of this pack is the Tendalos, and it's not close. It's just very strong and sturdy

**[18:21]** and really worth it as long as you're moving it around intelligently. The Vuneth is just okay.

**[18:28]** I'd rather have the Lange Spiders like 90% of the time, I think. And the Womps, as I've said,

**[18:34]** I don't want to keep piling on the Womps. They're just, I think, the worst of the neutral monsters.

**[18:39]** If you're paying 2 Doom for this, like, I don't know, are you drunk or something? I'm not really

**[18:45]** sure what you're doing. Sorry, Womps. If anybody has a great use for the Womps that I have completely

**[18:52]** missed, definitely let me know. But yeah, I'm definitely a Womp hater. If you're going to pick

**[18:58]** this up, do it for the hound. I do think they're really cool and strong and a spicy unit to add to

**[19:04]** your games. They'll be doing a lot of work, like, I think equivalent to an independent great old one.

**[19:11]** So if you manage to find them in a game, definitely watch out for them or buy them for yourself and see

**[19:16]** what you can do. I think that's another episode in the book, so thank you very much for listening.
