## Transcript

**[00:00]** Three times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvelous city, and three times was he snatched

**[00:05]** away while he paused on the high terrace above it. All golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset,

**[00:11]** with walls, temples, colonnades, and arched bridges of veined marble, silver basin fountains of

**[00:17]** prismatic spray, in broad squares and perfumed gardens, with wide streets marching between

**[00:22]** delicate trees and blossom-laden urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows. While on steep northward

**[00:29]** slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harboring little lanes of grassy cobbles.

**[00:35]** It was a fever of the gods, a fanfare of supernatural trumpets and a clash of immortal symbols.

**[00:42]** Mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain, and as Carter stood breathless

**[00:47]** and expectant on that balustrated parapet, there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of

**[00:53]** almost vanished memory, the pain of lost things, and the maddening need to place again

**[00:59]** what had once been an awesome and momentous place.

**[01:17]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:24]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[01:27]** Hope you're doing well.

**[01:29]** I'm recording this on Juneteenth.

**[01:31]** I'm off of work.

**[01:33]** I'm having a great weekend.

**[01:36]** Two of my favorite bands ever came out with albums on the exact same day, Queens of the Stone Age

**[01:41]** and King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.

**[01:44]** I've been listening to those off and on all weekend.

**[01:47]** And yesterday was Father's Day.

**[01:48]** I baked the first cheesecake I've ever baked in my life, and it turned out amazing.

**[01:54]** Like, the best cheesecake I've ever had.

**[01:55]** So I was pretty shocked and surprised how well that went.

**[02:00]** Speaking of Queens of the Stone Age, there's a weird connection I've found between Queens

**[02:06]** of the Stone Age and Cthulhu Wars.

**[02:07]** So just for a little fun, I'll give you a moment to see if you know what that connection is.

**[02:17]** Okay, I've let you have a little pause.

**[02:19]** What do you think the connection is?

**[02:21]** The font, Abaddon, that's used for Cthulhu Wars, it's actually the exact same font that

**[02:27]** they used on the Songs for the Deaf album cover from Queens of the Stone Age.

**[02:32]** Go look it up.

**[02:33]** Compare the two.

**[02:34]** You'll see I'm right.

**[02:35]** I was happy the day I realized that two things I like so much are together.

**[02:41]** I have a Queens of the Stone Age tattoo, so I'm very, very into this band.

**[02:45]** My favorite band and my favorite game sharing something in common.

**[02:49]** So that's pretty cool.

**[02:52]** Anyway, what are we doing today in this episode?

**[02:54]** This is going to be our first map-specific episode.

**[02:57]** I've covered some factions.

**[02:59]** I've covered some neutrals.

**[03:01]** There's a number of other maps in Cthulhu Wars as well.

**[03:04]** I believe there are six, including Earth.

**[03:07]** So today we are covering the Dreamlands map.

**[03:11]** You heard a little bit in the intro there of the story,

**[03:15]** The Dream Quest to Unknown Kadath by H.P. Lovecraft.

**[03:19]** One of the longer stories that he wrote, I think, second only to the Mountains of Madness

**[03:25]** in terms of length.

**[03:27]** Basically a novella, you could say.

**[03:28]** It's featuring this protagonist, Randolph Carter.

**[03:33]** You all can see him make an appearance, a reappearance, I should say, in another story,

**[03:38]** The Silver Key.

**[03:39]** And there's also Through the Gates of the Silver Key, which H.P. Lovecraft wrote with E.

**[03:44]** Hoffman Price.

**[03:47]** The Dreamlands as a setting, I have also seen it in other material.

**[03:51]** Something I read more recently was a story called The Dream Quest of Velet Bowe by Kidd Johnson.

**[03:57]** Hopefully I'm saying their name right.

**[03:59]** I also thought that was a pretty cool story.

**[04:00]** Sort of took the original lore from the Dreamlands and turned it on its head a little bit,

**[04:05]** introducing a different character.

**[04:07]** It was an enjoyable read.

**[04:08]** You should check it out.

**[04:10]** The Dreamlands is what it sounds like if you haven't read the story.

**[04:13]** It's like a world of dreams.

**[04:14]** Some people, like Randolph and others, are able to access the Dreamworlds when they go to sleep.

**[04:21]** There's other ways to get there.

**[04:22]** You could get there through the waking world, through some Gates into the underworld, through a graveyard.

**[04:31]** You could read about that more in some other stories.

**[04:35]** I'm not really sure how I want to structure this episode, so I'm just going to go with it this time.

**[04:39]** I might have a better format for a future map episode,

**[04:42]** but for right now, I'm just going to give a little bit of an overview of the map.

**[04:46]** I'll go over the additional rules for the map.

**[04:49]** And finally, I will talk a little bit about how playing on this map can affect certain factions,

**[04:55]** certain strategies some factions might want to go for on this map, and things like that.

**[05:01]** Starting with the layout of the Dreamlands map, it is very different.

**[05:05]** If you've only ever played on Earth, this is a very different experience.

**[05:08]** So on Earth, the map wraps around.

**[05:13]** It's not so on the Dreamlands.

**[05:14]** It's not a wraparound map.

**[05:16]** Instead, we actually have a map that is in two different planes.

**[05:20]** So try to see that in your mind's eye.

**[05:23]** There are two squares.

**[05:25]** They don't wrap around.

**[05:26]** However, one of them is the surface level,

**[05:28]** and the other one is the underworld,

**[05:31]** where all of the dark, dwelling, nasties, nasty monsters are.

**[05:35]** Imagine one level is above the other level.

**[05:41]** How is the surface map connected to the underworld level?

**[05:45]** It is through four-lettered tunnels, A through D.

**[05:51]** These are adjacent for all purposes.

**[05:54]** So I can move from, for example, Lang, which has the B tunnel.

**[06:01]** If I want to, I can move down into the underworld onto the plane of Ghouls,

**[06:06]** which also has the B letter.

**[06:10]** The tunnels are adjacent for all purposes, even panes.

**[06:14]** So that's another way to use them.

**[06:16]** If you fight in a battle and you get paned,

**[06:18]** you could pan yourself up to the surface from the underworld and vice versa.

**[06:22]** So that's like a little bit of the lay of the land of the map.

**[06:27]** The last feature of this map,

**[06:29]** there are four areas on each level.

**[06:33]** They all have a symbol,

**[06:35]** looks a little bit like maybe a bit of a tower with a crystal,

**[06:39]** and they have a little red box showing a number.

**[06:42]** It's either going to be a single number,

**[06:44]** or it's going to be a couple of numbers,

**[06:46]** like a one to two or five to six.

**[06:48]** These are special areas.

**[06:50]** They're called citadels.

**[06:51]** And that brings us to the second aspect of this map

**[06:55]** that's very, very important to keep in mind if you're playing on it.

**[06:58]** There is an alternate victory condition on this map,

**[07:01]** aside from getting 30 doom and earning all your Spellbooks.

**[07:04]** If a single player controls a Gate on all four citadel glyphs on one map at any moment,

**[07:11]** they immediately win,

**[07:13]** regardless of whether or not they have all six of their faction Spellbooks,

**[07:17]** or whether they have the most doom points.

**[07:20]** So that right there is very spicy.

**[07:22]** That is the reason to play,

**[07:23]** or maybe not to play on this map,

**[07:25]** if you enjoy that kind of thing.

**[07:27]** Personally, I love this.

**[07:29]** I think it's very cool that there's another angle on which to win.

**[07:34]** People's opinion of this map varies pretty drastically.

**[07:37]** There are people like me.

**[07:38]** I absolutely love this one.

**[07:40]** And there's other people that would prefer not to play on it at all

**[07:43]** because they don't like the alternate win cons.

**[07:44]** So each their own.

**[07:46]** Hopefully you're here,

**[07:47]** you're sticking around because you want to know more,

**[07:49]** and we'll get to it.

**[07:51]** It's not going to be actually a walk in the park

**[07:54]** to get that citadel win condition.

**[07:56]** That brings us to some of the denizens that occupy this map.

**[08:01]** In the tunnels of that twisted wood

**[08:03]** whose low prodigious oaks twine groping bows

**[08:06]** and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange Fungi

**[08:09]** dwell the furtive and secretive zoogs

**[08:11]** who know many obscure secrets of the dream world

**[08:14]** and a few of the waking world.

**[08:15]** Since the wood at two places touches the lands of men,

**[08:18]** though it would be disastrous to say where.

**[08:21]** Certain unexplained rumors, events, and vanishments

**[08:23]** occur among men where the zoogs have access,

**[08:27]** and it's well that they can't travel far

**[08:29]** outside the world of dream.

**[08:30]** But over the nearer parts of the dream world,

**[08:32]** they pass freely,

**[08:34]** splitting small and brown unseen

**[08:36]** and bearing back tales to beguile the hours

**[08:39]** around their hearts in the forest they love.

**[08:41]** Most of them live in burrows,

**[08:43]** but some inhabit the trunks of the great trees,

**[08:46]** and although they live mostly on Fungi,

**[08:48]** it's muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat,

**[08:51]** neither physical or spiritual,

**[08:53]** for certainly many dreamers have entered the wood

**[08:55]** who've not come out.

**[08:56]** There we have our first, you could say, adversary on the dream lands map.

**[09:03]** The things that are preventing us from easily building those four Gates

**[09:07]** on the surface level and winning with the citadels

**[09:10]** are going to be the zoogs.

**[09:11]** They kind of look a little bit like a big rat, honestly.

**[09:16]** They kind of look like a rat schnauzer.

**[09:19]** They're not nice looking.

**[09:21]** They're like perched on a leafy thing.

**[09:24]** They don't look pleasant.

**[09:25]** They look a little bit too big

**[09:26]** to be really comfortable around them.

**[09:29]** So there's that.

**[09:31]** Starting to get into the rules function of this map.

**[09:36]** This adds an extra step onto the end of the doom phase.

**[09:40]** So after everybody has had the chance to do all their doom phase effects,

**[09:44]** do rituals, what have you,

**[09:45]** then all of our monsters in the dream lands are going to activate.

**[09:50]** So in the case of the zoogs,

**[09:52]** during the special event step at the doom phase,

**[09:54]** that's at the end, like I said,

**[09:56]** roll 1d6 for each zoog that is not in play.

**[09:59]** Then place that zoog on the surface citadel

**[10:02]** labeled with the appropriate numbers.

**[10:05]** Any controlling units on a Gate in a citadel with zoogs

**[10:08]** must immediately come off that Gate,

**[10:10]** which is now abandoned.

**[10:12]** Zoogist pranks and other shenanigans

**[10:14]** render that Gate impossible to control

**[10:16]** until the pests are abated.

**[10:20]** Zoogs already on the map simply remain in their areas.

**[10:23]** Do not roll for them.

**[10:25]** Units may not control Gates in areas

**[10:27]** that contain one or more zoogs.

**[10:29]** Before your Cultist or a Dark Young

**[10:31]** can control a Gate in a zoog-infested area,

**[10:34]** you must rid the area of zoogs.

**[10:37]** To do this, you'll need appropriate Spellbooks

**[10:40]** or to engage in battle.

**[10:42]** And how can we defeat the zoogs?

**[10:44]** They can be attacked like any other enemy.

**[10:46]** They don't roll any combat dice.

**[10:48]** Each kill kills a zoog.

**[10:50]** Each pain, likewise, eliminates a zoog,

**[10:52]** but also pains one of the attacker's units.

**[10:55]** This does not count as a kill.

**[10:56]** It just means that the zoog vanished into the underbrush.

**[11:00]** Zoogs can be eliminated by appropriate Spellbooks and abilities

**[11:03]** as with any other monster.

**[11:05]** They can be devoured, abducted, etc.

**[11:08]** If a zoog is somehow moved to an area

**[11:10]** that's not in a citadel,

**[11:11]** it's instead removed from the map.

**[11:14]** The zoogs return to the map

**[11:16]** in the next doom phase.

**[11:17]** So basically the shorthand version of this

**[11:20]** is every doom phase,

**[11:22]** see if there's any zoogs that are off the map,

**[11:24]** and you're going to roll for them

**[11:25]** to figure out where they go.

**[11:27]** I mentioned earlier the citadel areas

**[11:29]** each have a number or numbers

**[11:31]** on their spaces,

**[11:33]** so there's like a 1 to 2,

**[11:35]** a 5 to 6,

**[11:36]** and then a 3 and a 4.

**[11:38]** That's where the zoogs will end up.

**[11:39]** And once they're there,

**[11:40]** you don't really need to worry about them

**[11:42]** unless you have a Gate there.

**[11:43]** They will just hang out there

**[11:44]** until somebody battles them

**[11:46]** or makes them leave for some other reason.

**[11:49]** So if someone is trying to go for that citadel win

**[11:52]** on the surface level,

**[11:54]** they're going to have to be able to

**[11:56]** battle away the zoogs.

**[11:58]** They're going to be everywhere.

**[11:59]** They're likely they'll be somewhat evenly distributed

**[12:02]** between the four areas,

**[12:04]** but as I noted,

**[12:05]** there are two areas in particular

**[12:07]** that have 1 and 2 and 5 and 6,

**[12:10]** so more likely that zoogs will end up there.

**[12:12]** So if you're trying to go for a citadel victory

**[12:15]** on the surface,

**[12:16]** keep that in mind.

**[12:17]** Maybe put more of your combat dice

**[12:20]** in those areas

**[12:21]** so that you can more easily kill

**[12:23]** or paint out those zoogs and win.

**[12:26]** And so that is the surface level,

**[12:28]** but we've also got the underworld

**[12:29]** and the underworld also has

**[12:31]** just one creature that's watching out

**[12:34]** for all the citadels

**[12:35]** and trying to prevent players

**[12:36]** from winning the game down there.

**[12:39]** Carter knew from a certain source

**[12:40]** that he was in the Vale of Panath

**[12:42]** where crawl and burrow are the enormous bulls,

**[12:44]** but he did not know what to expect

**[12:46]** because no one has ever seen a bull

**[12:47]** or even guessed what such a thing may be like.

**[12:51]** Bulls are known only by dim rumor

**[12:52]** from the rustling they make

**[12:54]** amongst the mountains of bones

**[12:55]** and the slimy touch they have

**[12:57]** when they wriggle past one.

**[12:58]** It cannot be seen

**[12:59]** because they creep only in the dark.

**[13:03]** That's right.

**[13:04]** The guardian of the underworld down there

**[13:06]** is going to be the bull.

**[13:08]** Not to be confused with the dole

**[13:09]** with a D from the Cosmic Terror's

**[13:12]** neutral expansion,

**[13:13]** which we will cover at some point.

**[13:15]** What's the difference between bulls and doles?

**[13:17]** I've honestly heard it's just a typo.

**[13:19]** That was never corrected.

**[13:21]** We'll never know for sure

**[13:22]** until we can speak to

**[13:24]** H.P. Lovecraft beyond the grave

**[13:26]** or whatever,

**[13:27]** but here we have a bull

**[13:28]** and there are doles,

**[13:30]** but they're not here.

**[13:33]** The bull sculpt is very cool.

**[13:35]** It just looks like it's bursting

**[13:36]** out of the ground.

**[13:38]** It almost looks like a tree trunk.

**[13:40]** I can see the mouth,

**[13:41]** but the texture on the outside,

**[13:43]** something between like a reptilian

**[13:45]** and a tree.

**[13:46]** I would consider using this

**[13:48]** for my great old one

**[13:50]** in my custom faction.

**[13:51]** Maybe I'll talk about that someday.

**[13:54]** The bull works a little bit

**[13:56]** like the zoogs,

**[13:58]** but is a lot more mean.

**[14:00]** Let me go over how the bull works.

**[14:03]** During the special event segment

**[14:04]** of the doom phase,

**[14:05]** that's at the end of the doom phase,

**[14:06]** after rituals and whatnot,

**[14:08]** like we said,

**[14:09]** if the bull is in an area

**[14:10]** containing a Gate,

**[14:11]** he remains in place

**[14:12]** and destroys the Gate

**[14:13]** and any controlling unit.

**[14:15]** The bull does not affect

**[14:17]** anything else in the area.

**[14:18]** Or,

**[14:19]** if the bull is not in an area

**[14:21]** with a Gate,

**[14:22]** roll one die,

**[14:23]** move the bull to the underworld citadel

**[14:25]** labeled with the appropriate number,

**[14:27]** even if the designated citadel

**[14:28]** lacks a Gate.

**[14:30]** If the citadel of the bull's enters

**[14:31]** contains a Gate,

**[14:33]** that Gate is immediately destroyed

**[14:34]** along with any controlling unit.

**[14:36]** The bull does not affect

**[14:37]** anything else in the area.

**[14:40]** Okay, great.

**[14:41]** How do we defeat the bull?

**[14:42]** The bull may be attacked

**[14:43]** like any unit

**[14:45]** during a player's action.

**[14:46]** Any player may initiate

**[14:48]** a battle against the bull

**[14:49]** if they have any units

**[14:50]** in the same area.

**[14:51]** And if you can roll

**[14:52]** at least one combat die,

**[14:53]** because you need that

**[14:54]** to be able to declare a battle

**[14:55]** in the first place.

**[14:57]** The bull is treated

**[14:58]** as a great old one

**[14:59]** with respects to Spellbooks

**[15:00]** and abilities,

**[15:01]** so you're not going to be able

**[15:01]** to abduct the bull

**[15:02]** or devour the bull.

**[15:04]** A lot of the tricks

**[15:04]** that will work on zoogs

**[15:05]** will not work on the bull.

**[15:07]** On any pain result,

**[15:08]** the bull retreats

**[15:09]** to the veil of Panath

**[15:10]** regardless of the presence

**[15:12]** of other units.

**[15:14]** He can't be eliminated

**[15:16]** by being surrounded.

**[15:18]** If the bull is already

**[15:19]** in the veil of Panath,

**[15:20]** it ignores the pain.

**[15:21]** On a kill result,

**[15:22]** the bull is destroyed.

**[15:23]** If the bull is eliminated,

**[15:26]** a new bull appears

**[15:27]** in the veil of Panath

**[15:28]** in the special events step

**[15:30]** of the next doom phase.

**[15:32]** A newly spawned bull

**[15:33]** does not immediately roll

**[15:34]** to move onto a citadel,

**[15:36]** but merely stays in the veil.

**[15:39]** However, he does destroy a Gate

**[15:40]** in any controlling unit

**[15:41]** if there is one

**[15:42]** in the veil of Panath

**[15:43]** when he reappears.

**[15:46]** So that was a lot.

**[15:47]** Let's break down

**[15:48]** how the bull works

**[15:50]** a little bit more.

**[15:51]** The bull,

**[15:52]** there's only one of them.

**[15:53]** You will want to be

**[15:54]** making sure you keep tabs

**[15:56]** on the bull.

**[15:57]** Unlike the zoogs,

**[15:58]** once they all get out,

**[15:59]** you can kind of ignore them

**[16:00]** unless somebody removes them.

**[16:02]** The bull is going to be out

**[16:03]** and just keep moving around

**[16:04]** every doom phase,

**[16:06]** assuming it doesn't get killed.

**[16:08]** When it moves into your area,

**[16:10]** it will leave all the monsters

**[16:11]** behind that might be there,

**[16:12]** all the great old ones.

**[16:13]** It will kill any Gate

**[16:14]** and any Cultist

**[16:15]** that's controlling the Gate.

**[16:16]** Or if it's Dark Young,

**[16:18]** it will kill the Dark Young as well.

**[16:19]** So that means

**[16:22]** going for the Citadel win

**[16:23]** in the Underworld

**[16:24]** is like a bit

**[16:25]** higher risk-reward.

**[16:28]** I would say

**[16:28]** it's easier to do

**[16:30]** because there's less

**[16:31]** things that are going

**[16:33]** to be interfering with you.

**[16:35]** But if the bull

**[16:35]** does move into an area

**[16:37]** and destroy one of your Gates

**[16:38]** that you were hoping to win with,

**[16:40]** that does hurt a lot.

**[16:41]** You spent three Power

**[16:42]** building that Gate,

**[16:42]** most likely.

**[16:44]** That's a lot of Power

**[16:45]** to get just taken away

**[16:46]** from you all of a sudden.

**[16:48]** And like on the surface,

**[16:49]** there are areas

**[16:50]** on the Underworld,

**[16:52]** the Citadel glyphs,

**[16:53]** that have a 1 and a 2

**[16:55]** and a 5 and a 6.

**[16:56]** So there are two areas

**[16:57]** that the bull

**[16:58]** is more likely to go to,

**[17:00]** where you have a 1 and 3 shot

**[17:01]** of the bull showing up

**[17:02]** versus like a 1 and 6 shot

**[17:04]** in the other two Citadel glyphs.

**[17:08]** There you have the rules breakdown

**[17:10]** of the Dreamlands map.

**[17:12]** You can totally win on this map

**[17:14]** the traditional way,

**[17:15]** but again,

**[17:15]** there is this other axis

**[17:17]** of alternate win condition

**[17:19]** that you really do

**[17:20]** want to be watching for.

**[17:23]** Let's go over like

**[17:24]** a little bit of the

**[17:25]** faction specifics

**[17:26]** that might come up

**[17:27]** on the Dreamlands.

**[17:29]** First thing,

**[17:30]** like we've been saying

**[17:31]** the whole episode,

**[17:32]** as we've been explaining

**[17:33]** the rules,

**[17:34]** always be watching

**[17:35]** for that Citadel win.

**[17:36]** There are certain factions

**[17:37]** that are completely nasty

**[17:39]** on this map.

**[17:40]** I wouldn't say like

**[17:40]** unbalanced,

**[17:42]** but there are factions

**[17:43]** that are going to want to go

**[17:44]** for that win condition

**[17:45]** every time,

**[17:46]** I would say,

**[17:47]** and those are

**[17:48]** Opener,

**[17:49]** Sleeper,

**[17:50]** Demon Sultan.

**[17:52]** Why?

**[17:53]** All these factions

**[17:54]** have a way

**[17:55]** to either

**[17:56]** build Gates

**[17:57]** cheaply

**[17:58]** or move them.

**[17:59]** For Opener's case,

**[18:01]** you've got

**[18:02]** Beyond One.

**[18:04]** Opener units,

**[18:05]** along with your

**[18:06]** They Breakthrough Spellbook,

**[18:08]** it's very easy

**[18:08]** to just get an

**[18:09]** Opener unit,

**[18:10]** add a Gate,

**[18:10]** and all of a sudden,

**[18:12]** like,

**[18:12]** whoops,

**[18:12]** the Gate has moved,

**[18:14]** now it's in a Citadel location

**[18:15]** exactly where you want it.

**[18:18]** You have five

**[18:19]** Opener units in the pool,

**[18:20]** six counting Yogg

**[18:21]** that are able to do this,

**[18:23]** and maybe you don't even

**[18:24]** need to move all of them,

**[18:25]** but Opener has

**[18:26]** tons of potential

**[18:27]** to be able to do

**[18:28]** that kind of thing.

**[18:31]** Sleeper,

**[18:32]** somewhat lesser

**[18:33]** able to do this

**[18:34]** than the other factions,

**[18:35]** though you do have,

**[18:36]** obviously,

**[18:36]** your Lethargy,

**[18:37]** you can wait people out

**[18:38]** and go build Gates

**[18:39]** after they're out of Power,

**[18:41]** but I also want to

**[18:42]** shout out Sleeper's

**[18:43]** Cursed Slumber Spellbook,

**[18:44]** which is extremely

**[18:45]** strong on this map.

**[18:47]** I'll cover it

**[18:48]** more in a Sleeper episode,

**[18:50]** but essentially,

**[18:51]** Sleeper can take

**[18:51]** a Gate

**[18:53]** off the map

**[18:54]** and put it

**[18:54]** on their faction board.

**[18:56]** What you don't see

**[18:57]** that often

**[18:57]** is Sleeper players

**[18:59]** taking that

**[19:00]** Gate

**[19:00]** on their faction board

**[19:01]** and then

**[19:02]** redeploying it

**[19:03]** back onto the map.

**[19:04]** It can be in any area

**[19:05]** when they do that,

**[19:06]** so for the Citadel

**[19:08]** win condition,

**[19:09]** it's a really easy

**[19:10]** way to

**[19:11]** flop down a Gate

**[19:12]** exactly where you

**[19:13]** need it to be.

**[19:14]** Not only that,

**[19:15]** but you're also

**[19:15]** setting yourself up

**[19:16]** to Cursed Slumber

**[19:17]** again somewhere else.

**[19:19]** Slowly move the Gates

**[19:20]** into position

**[19:21]** for that Citadel win

**[19:22]** alongside your Lethargy

**[19:23]** can be very effective.

**[19:28]** Lastly,

**[19:29]** Demon Sultan,

**[19:30]** very, very adept

**[19:31]** for going for that

**[19:32]** Citadel win.

**[19:33]** For starters,

**[19:34]** you have the Demon Sultan

**[19:35]** Psychosis unique faction ability.

**[19:37]** that's going to allow

**[19:38]** them to deploy

**[19:39]** Cultist in all the

**[19:40]** right areas

**[19:40]** very easily

**[19:41]** for zero Power,

**[19:43]** not even really

**[19:44]** having to move there.

**[19:45]** They can be in

**[19:46]** position to win with this

**[19:47]** like almost right

**[19:48]** off the bat,

**[19:48]** so be watching

**[19:49]** for sure.

**[19:51]** Not only can they

**[19:52]** position their

**[19:52]** Acolytes very easily,

**[19:54]** they also have

**[19:55]** Chaos Gate

**[19:56]** as a very cheap way

**[19:58]** to construct Gates.

**[19:59]** The Citadel win

**[20:00]** con does not care

**[20:01]** what kind of Gates

**[20:02]** there are there

**[20:02]** as long as there are Gates,

**[20:04]** so you can build

**[20:05]** a Chaos Gate

**[20:06]** very cheaply

**[20:06]** for one Power,

**[20:08]** Demon Sultan has

**[20:08]** Consummation,

**[20:09]** you can reuse

**[20:10]** Chaos Gate

**[20:11]** to build for another Power,

**[20:13]** and on top of all of that,

**[20:15]** they also have

**[20:15]** their Animate Matter

**[20:17]** Spellbook,

**[20:17]** so even if there's

**[20:18]** a Chaos Gate

**[20:19]** maybe in the wrong location,

**[20:21]** they can just move it

**[20:22]** to an adjacent location.

**[20:23]** That might be

**[20:24]** the Citadel

**[20:24]** that they need

**[20:25]** in order to win.

**[20:28]** You've been warned,

**[20:29]** that's a PSA,

**[20:30]** do not sleep on

**[20:31]** any of these factions

**[20:31]** if you're playing

**[20:32]** on the Dreamlands map,

**[20:33]** you will lose to them

**[20:34]** when they go for

**[20:35]** the Citadel win

**[20:36]** if you're not

**[20:36]** paying attention.

**[20:38]** Again,

**[20:39]** this game,

**[20:40]** you know,

**[20:40]** maybe not perfectly balanced.

**[20:41]** I would say on this map,

**[20:42]** if those factions,

**[20:43]** any of them are in play,

**[20:45]** go after them aggressively,

**[20:46]** do not make their life easy,

**[20:47]** because they are going

**[20:49]** to have a very easy time

**[20:50]** winning if they're

**[20:50]** not picked on.

**[20:53]** Some other factions

**[20:54]** to pay attention to

**[20:55]** on this map,

**[20:56]** maybe one other call

**[20:57]** would be Yellow Sign.

**[20:59]** Yellow Sign's start area

**[21:00]** on this map is very awkward.

**[21:02]** It is cellophase,

**[21:03]** it's like on the right-hand side

**[21:05]** of the surface map.

**[21:07]** It is a Citadel area,

**[21:08]** notably,

**[21:08]** so you will already have

**[21:10]** control of a Gate

**[21:11]** and a Citadel glyph

**[21:12]** right at the start of the game.

**[21:14]** Great,

**[21:15]** but those zoogs,

**[21:17]** they are going to show up.

**[21:19]** Yellow Sign is not known

**[21:20]** for their combat prowess,

**[21:23]** so that's something

**[21:23]** to keep in mind.

**[21:25]** Don't leave your starting Gate

**[21:26]** unattended with no combat dice

**[21:28]** on this map as Yellow Sign,

**[21:29]** because the zoogs are just

**[21:30]** going to kick you off the Gate

**[21:32]** and you're going to be sad.

**[21:33]** Not only this,

**[21:35]** they need to go on

**[21:36]** their journey

**[21:37]** in order to get

**[21:38]** all of their Spellbooks,

**[21:39]** and that is by

**[21:39]** desecrating on

**[21:41]** different areas

**[21:42]** with different glyphs

**[21:43]** on them, right?

**[21:44]** We will cover

**[21:45]** Yellow Sign soon,

**[21:46]** I promise.

**[21:47]** The problem is

**[21:48]** cellface is very awkwardly

**[21:50]** not that connected

**[21:52]** as some other areas are.

**[21:55]** You're only connected

**[21:56]** to two areas,

**[21:57]** one of which is

**[21:58]** Cthulhu's starting area,

**[21:59]** so I don't recommend

**[22:00]** traveling through there

**[22:01]** if Cthulhu's in the game.

**[22:03]** You will be sad.

**[22:05]** There's the Sunken Sea,

**[22:06]** which is also an ocean area.

**[22:08]** You're going to have to

**[22:09]** cross in one of those areas

**[22:10]** to get anywhere.

**[22:12]** There's no tunnels,

**[22:13]** there's nothing.

**[22:14]** You need to move

**[22:15]** at least two spaces

**[22:16]** in order for you

**[22:17]** to be able to

**[22:19]** get your Spellbooks

**[22:19]** and actually win the game.

**[22:21]** So keep that in mind,

**[22:22]** do not let yourself

**[22:23]** get boxed in.

**[22:24]** That's going to be

**[22:25]** a real problem for you.

**[22:26]** That being said,

**[22:28]** once you are able

**[22:29]** to get out of that

**[22:30]** cellface area

**[22:30]** and start moving around,

**[22:32]** I actually think

**[22:33]** this is maybe

**[22:33]** the easiest map

**[22:34]** in order for your

**[22:35]** Yellow Sign

**[22:36]** to get all of their books.

**[22:38]** I would say

**[22:38]** once you get out

**[22:39]** of that cellface area,

**[22:40]** I would make my way

**[22:41]** to the Enchanted Woods

**[22:42]** that has the Ouroboros glyph.

**[22:44]** It's also got

**[22:45]** the Sea Tunnel.

**[22:46]** If you take that tunnel

**[22:47]** down into the underworld,

**[22:49]** you will then be

**[22:51]** at the Tower of Koth,

**[22:53]** which has that,

**[22:54]** what do you call it,

**[22:56]** looks like a

**[22:56]** claw scraping glyph.

**[22:58]** And the cellface area

**[23:00]** has that chevron glyph.

**[23:01]** So between those three,

**[23:03]** you should be able to

**[23:03]** get your Spellbooks

**[23:04]** hopefully easily,

**[23:06]** assuming you don't get

**[23:07]** trapped in cellface.

**[23:08]** So Yellow Sign players,

**[23:09]** you've been warned.

**[23:10]** If you play on this map,

**[23:12]** do not dawdle.

**[23:13]** I would get the hell

**[23:14]** out of there

**[23:14]** as soon as you can

**[23:15]** and leave some combat dice

**[23:17]** so the zoogs don't

**[23:18]** take away control

**[23:19]** of your Gate.

**[23:19]** And I think that's

**[23:23]** actually all that we

**[23:24]** have for this episode.

**[23:26]** I guess I'll just give

**[23:27]** you my overall impression

**[23:28]** of this map.

**[23:29]** I've played on most

**[23:31]** of the alternate maps

**[23:31]** and I do think this one

**[23:33]** is one of my favorites.

**[23:35]** Like I said earlier,

**[23:36]** I really like the

**[23:38]** alternate win condition.

**[23:39]** I know it's not

**[23:39]** for everybody.

**[23:41]** For me, I find it

**[23:42]** very, very interesting

**[23:43]** in an already chaotic

**[23:45]** game like Cthulhu Wars

**[23:46]** that there is now

**[23:47]** this other way to win.

**[23:48]** It will just put

**[23:49]** a lot of people

**[23:50]** on tilt.

**[23:51]** They're not really

**[23:52]** going to know

**[23:53]** what the right thing

**[23:54]** to do is.

**[23:56]** Is it better to go

**[23:56]** for that traditional win

**[23:57]** or is it better

**[23:58]** to really lean into

**[24:00]** that Citadel win

**[24:01]** condition and see

**[24:02]** if you can pull it off?

**[24:04]** And I actually like

**[24:05]** if any of those

**[24:06]** villainous Gate-moving

**[24:07]** factions I mentioned

**[24:08]** earlier in the game,

**[24:09]** I also think that

**[24:10]** makes the game

**[24:11]** super interesting.

**[24:13]** If three players

**[24:14]** are going for

**[24:14]** that traditional win

**[24:15]** but there's one player

**[24:17]** that is going for

**[24:17]** the Citadel win,

**[24:19]** everybody needs to be

**[24:19]** talking about how

**[24:20]** to stop them.

**[24:22]** On top of that,

**[24:23]** one other thing I would

**[24:24]** say is a big plus

**[24:25]** in terms of this map

**[24:26]** is there is like

**[24:28]** really, really minimal

**[24:29]** rules overhead

**[24:30]** compared to some

**[24:32]** of the other maps.

**[24:33]** Really, all you need

**[24:35]** to do is pay attention

**[24:35]** at the end of the

**[24:36]** Doom phase.

**[24:37]** That's when like

**[24:37]** stuff is happening

**[24:38]** for lack of a better

**[24:39]** term.

**[24:41]** If the Zoogs are

**[24:41]** all in play,

**[24:42]** great, you can just

**[24:43]** skip.

**[24:45]** If a Zoog's off the

**[24:46]** map, roll a d6.

**[24:47]** Very easy to remember.

**[24:48]** Then you just need

**[24:49]** to remember the bowl

**[24:50]** and moving the bowl

**[24:51]** around or respawning

**[24:53]** the bowl if it got

**[24:53]** killed and that's

**[24:54]** pretty much it.

**[24:56]** There's not anything

**[24:56]** else to keep track of.

**[24:58]** So if you're looking

**[24:59]** for a different map

**[25:00]** to play on with

**[25:01]** your group,

**[25:02]** if Earth is like

**[25:03]** starting to feel a

**[25:03]** bit stale,

**[25:04]** I would say really

**[25:06]** highly recommend

**[25:07]** this map.

**[25:08]** If your group can

**[25:09]** get together and

**[25:09]** play two games on

**[25:10]** Earth, I think you

**[25:11]** could do the same

**[25:12]** thing on the

**[25:13]** Dreamlands.

**[25:13]** I don't think

**[25:14]** there's so much

**[25:15]** overhead added

**[25:16]** because of this

**[25:17]** map that it

**[25:18]** doesn't make the

**[25:19]** difference between

**[25:19]** playing one game

**[25:21]** and playing two

**[25:22]** games.

**[25:22]** As I've said in

**[25:23]** other episodes,

**[25:23]** that is a big

**[25:24]** deal for me.

**[25:25]** If I get together

**[25:26]** with people in real

**[25:26]** life to play

**[25:27]** Cthulhu Wars, I'm

**[25:28]** trying to play as

**[25:29]** many games as

**[25:29]** possible.

**[25:31]** Ideally, I'm

**[25:32]** playing two games

**[25:32]** in one sitting

**[25:33]** and you can

**[25:34]** definitely do that

**[25:35]** on this map,

**[25:35]** especially once

**[25:37]** everyone's played

**[25:37]** on it once before.

**[25:38]** You'll find

**[25:39]** yourselves quickly

**[25:40]** moving through that

**[25:41]** special event step in

**[25:42]** the Doom phase

**[25:43]** like it was

**[25:44]** natural and you've

**[25:44]** been doing it

**[25:45]** always.

**[25:47]** I also really

**[25:48]** really like this

**[25:48]** map because the

**[25:50]** Dreamlands is such

**[25:51]** a rich story.

**[25:52]** A lot of Lovecraft's

**[25:53]** stories are very

**[25:54]** short stories and

**[25:55]** there's actually not

**[25:56]** that much there.

**[25:58]** He went into

**[25:59]** great detail describing

**[26:00]** a lot of the

**[26:02]** places on this

**[26:03]** map.

**[26:04]** So just some of

**[26:05]** the ones that are

**[26:05]** very cool that

**[26:06]** stick out are

**[26:07]** Lang, you've

**[26:08]** probably heard of

**[26:08]** the Plateau of

**[26:09]** Lang elsewhere,

**[26:11]** Tower of Koth,

**[26:12]** the Vaults of

**[26:12]** Zinn, the

**[26:13]** Plain of the

**[26:14]** Ghouls, the

**[26:15]** Sea of Pitch,

**[26:16]** all these places

**[26:16]** are in the story,

**[26:17]** the Bale of

**[26:18]** B'nath, the

**[26:19]** Enchanted Woods

**[26:19]** where the

**[26:20]** Zoogs are from,

**[26:21]** Celiface itself

**[26:22]** has its own

**[26:23]** short story.

**[26:24]** All that is

**[26:24]** super super cool

**[26:25]** so I love that

**[26:26]** this was made

**[26:27]** into a map.

**[26:30]** And I think

**[26:31]** that's another

**[26:32]** episode in the

**[26:32]** book so thank

**[26:33]** you very much

**[26:34]** for listening.

**[26:35]** Definitely

**[26:35]** curious what you

**[26:36]** thought about

**[26:37]** this episode

**[26:38]** and I'm curious

**[26:39]** what other maps

**[26:41]** out there are

**[26:42]** people's favorites.

**[26:43]** I definitely

**[26:43]** have my

**[26:44]** opinions.
