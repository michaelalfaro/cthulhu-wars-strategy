## Transcript

**[00:00]** Light's still out. Must be five minutes now. Everything depends on lightning.

**[00:07]** Yadeth grant it will keep up. Some influence seems beating through it.

**[00:12]** Rain and thunder and wind deafen. The thing's taking hold of my mind.

**[00:16]** Trouble with memory. I see things I never knew before.

**[00:19]** Other worlds and other galaxies. Dark.

**[00:23]** The lighting seems dark and the darkness seems light.

**[00:26]** Cannot be the real hill and church that I see in the pitch darkness.

**[00:30]** Must be retinal impression left by flashes.

**[00:33]** Heaven grant the Italians are out with their candles if the lightning stops.

**[00:37]** What am I afraid of? Is it not an avatar of Narlathotep,

**[00:43]** who in antique and shadowy chem even took the form of man?

**[00:56]** Hello and welcome to Opening the Way. My name's Graham. I'm your host.

**[01:09]** Hope you're doing well. I'm hot off my Crawling Chaos guide recording

**[01:15]** and I thought what better to pair with that recording than the Masks of Narlathotep expansion.

**[01:23]** Everything here is in reference to Narlathotep's many forms, their shapeshifting ability,

**[01:29]** their ability to turn into any different thing. This expansion contains a bunch of

**[01:34]** different neutral units and what's interesting here is they have some asymmetry to them.

**[01:39]** They have some different requirements if they're claimed by specifically the Crawling Chaos faction.

**[01:46]** We've got the dark demons which are a new kind of Cultist.

**[01:50]** We've got the shadow pharaoh which is our first terror unit and we've got two great old ones,

**[01:56]** the bloated woman and the Haunter of the Dark.

**[02:00]** So without any further delay let's get into it.

**[02:03]** First thing I want to talk about is the dark demons.

**[02:07]** These are actually a Cultist, not a demon, not a monster, not a terror.

**[02:11]** There is one per faction color that will make sense in a minute.

**[02:15]** They cost one and they have zero combat.

**[02:18]** They kind of look like a pig.

**[02:22]** I'm dating myself here but they kind of remind me of, I don't know if you've ever watched

**[02:25]** Power Rangers, they kind of remind me of some villain that you might find in Power Rangers,

**[02:29]** something that you might find in maybe like the Ninja Turtles, something in like the late 80s,

**[02:33]** early 90s kind of aesthetic.

**[02:37]** How to obtain the dark demon card.

**[02:39]** In the doom phase, when it's your turn to perform a Ritual of Annihilation,

**[02:43]** you may pay two doom to obtain this loyalty card,

**[02:46]** then place the dark demon matching your faction's color anywhere on the map.

**[02:51]** If you wish, you can still perform a Ritual of Annihilation.

**[02:55]** Each of the other factions permanently loses an accolade from their pools,

**[02:59]** or on the map if all of them are in play,

**[03:01]** then adds to their pools a dark demon of their faction's color.

**[03:06]** If Crawling Chaos obtains this loyalty card, the rules above still apply,

**[03:10]** but the card's cost is now zero doom.

**[03:12]** When the other factions permanently lose their accolades as described above,

**[03:16]** each also gains one Elder Sign.

**[03:19]** So that's very interesting right off the bat.

**[03:21]** Here's the asymmetry coming into play.

**[03:23]** You normally need to pay two doom.

**[03:25]** Crawling Chaos doesn't need to pay any doom,

**[03:27]** but they will compensate the other players with an Elder Sign.

**[03:31]** On to the abilities on dark demon.

**[03:33]** The first one is the summons.

**[03:35]** Ongoing ability.

**[03:36]** Any faction with a dark demon in its pool cannot take any action

**[03:40]** other than recruiting the dark demon.

**[03:43]** You can still choose to drop your Power to zero

**[03:45]** and take no more actions during the action phase instead.

**[03:48]** Next ability, metamorph.

**[03:50]** Ongoing.

**[03:51]** Dark demons are a new type of Cultist and are treated as Cultists in every way,

**[03:55]** but they produce zero Power during the gather Power phase.

**[03:58]** They're recruited rather than summoned,

**[04:00]** so a controlled Gate is not needed to bring them into play.

**[04:03]** Dark demons may create and control Gates,

**[04:05]** and they're worth one Power when captured.

**[04:07]** It can be targeted by any Spellbooks or abilities

**[04:10]** that reference Cultists but not accolades.

**[04:13]** So kind of a lot to unpack here.

**[04:15]** I would say the dark demons are almost like

**[04:17]** a weirdly subtractive mirror of the high priests.

**[04:22]** Notably the player who purchased the dark demons.

**[04:25]** This is not going to replace one of your accolades with the dark demon,

**[04:29]** so slight Power boost there.

**[04:31]** You have the potential to control seven Gates now

**[04:34]** compared to the other players

**[04:36]** where they have like a net loss of one Power

**[04:39]** since dark demons can't produce Power.

**[04:42]** That ability, the summons, is very strange.

**[04:45]** I would describe it as kind of like a mini version

**[04:48]** of the servitors of the outer gods

**[04:50]** in that you must take this action if you're able to

**[04:53]** if you have a dark demon in your pool.

**[04:56]** If dark demons are left alone in the game,

**[04:59]** their effect, I would say, is pretty subtle.

**[05:01]** Just the subtracting of one Power,

**[05:03]** you may not even notice that they're there.

**[05:05]** However, if for some reason

**[05:07]** they're being repeatedly targeted and killed

**[05:11]** maybe they're being put back into the pool through something else

**[05:13]** maybe like a zingaya from a yellow sign

**[05:17]** or a groth, something like that,

**[05:20]** you will force the owners to repeatedly spend their actions

**[05:23]** recruiting them instead of doing something else

**[05:25]** that they'd much rather do.

**[05:27]** That can be very Powerful if you are trying to

**[05:30]** advance your board state

**[05:32]** while they need to get their dark demon back.

**[05:34]** Quick example, let's say there's a dark demon

**[05:37]** and it's not at a Gate that's especially well defended.

**[05:39]** If you move in and capture that dark demon or kill it

**[05:43]** you may have just got a Gate for yourself

**[05:45]** and instead of being able to retaliate against you

**[05:47]** the person on the receiving end has no choice

**[05:49]** but to recruit their dark demon as the next thing that they do.

**[05:53]** Factions that this is good with,

**[05:55]** obviously crawling chaos because of their flight ability

**[05:59]** and their kind of unparalleled ability to reach

**[06:02]** all players in all corners of the map.

**[06:05]** Any other factions that are going to be able to

**[06:07]** kill the dark demons easily with a big death ball

**[06:10]** like an opener or a wind walker or a sleeper,

**[06:14]** something that wants to eliminate Cultists

**[06:16]** or capture them or initiate fights,

**[06:19]** that's going to be useful.

**[06:21]** So the effectiveness of this unit is all down to

**[06:24]** how often you are going to be making people do

**[06:27]** the summons ability and force them to recruit the dark demon.

**[06:32]** It's a very strange unit.

**[06:34]** I've played several games with the dark demon

**[06:36]** but nobody was really exploiting the summons

**[06:39]** so it almost went unnoticed.

**[06:42]** So I don't highly recommend these as a neutral

**[06:45]** to include in your games of Cthulhu Wars

**[06:46]** but I am putting them down on my list

**[06:49]** for the hateful game of Cthulhu Wars

**[06:51]** I will play someday with just mean units

**[06:54]** that people can recruit.

**[06:56]** These are on the list.

**[06:58]** Let's move on to our next unit.

**[07:00]** It is the shadow pharaoh which costs two

**[07:03]** and has a combat of zero and is our first terror.

**[07:07]** Shadow pharaoh looks pretty creepy.

**[07:10]** It's sort of like a centaur sphinx thing going on.

**[07:14]** Looks like it's got some cat-like qualities.

**[07:17]** Very very long toes, almost tentacle looking toes on it.

**[07:22]** Very disturbing looking.

**[07:24]** Maybe looks a little emaciated around the abdomen

**[07:27]** and chest area.

**[07:29]** It's got its arms crossed like it's a mummy.

**[07:31]** Got what looks like a mask on, mask norlathotep.

**[07:34]** There it is coming in again.

**[07:35]** This is our first terror that we've discussed on this podcast.

**[07:39]** So what are terrors?

**[07:40]** Terrors are summoned as though they are monsters and

**[07:43]** require a controlled Gate to be able to enter play. They're equal to monsters in their ability

**[07:49]** to capture Cultists. That is, monsters can protect Cultists against terrors and vice

**[07:54]** versa, but Great Old Ones can still capture Cultists protected by terrors. The main difference

**[07:59]** here, terrors are a different type of unit. They're not monsters, so they're not vulnerable

**[08:04]** to abilities that specifically target monsters. So to give you an example, Crawling Chaos

**[08:10]** as Abduct and the Invisibility ability that works with Flying Polyps, those only say that

**[08:16]** they can target monsters, so they are not able to target terrors. Another notable ability

**[08:21]** is Sleeper's Capture Monster ability. It can only capture monsters, cannot capture terrors.

**[08:28]** To acquire a terror, pay 2 Power and 2 doom when it's your turn to perform a Ritual of

**[08:32]** Annihilation in the doom phase. You can still perform the ritual if you want to. Take your

**[08:37]** choice of available terror loyalty cards and follow the instructions for placing your

**[08:41]** new figure on the map. Players can only purchase a single loyalty card in any given doom phase,

**[08:47]** so they may not gain a neutral monster in the same doom phase in which they acquire

**[08:50]** a terror, and vice versa. Once a terror loyalty card has been acquired, it belongs to that

**[08:56]** player for the rest of the game. Only that player may summon and control that terror.

**[09:01]** How to obtain the Shadow Pharaoh loyalty card. In the doom phase, when it's your turn

**[09:06]** to perform a ritual, pay 2 doom and 2 Power to obtain this loyalty card, then place the

**[09:12]** Shadow Pharaoh at your controlled Gate. You can still perform a ritual if you want to.

**[09:16]** For Crawling Chaos in the doom phase, when it's your turn to perform a ritual, you may

**[09:21]** pay only 2 Power to obtain this loyalty card, then place the Shadow Pharaoh at one of your

**[09:25]** Gates. If you wish, you can still perform a ritual. Each other player gains an Elder

**[09:30]** Sign.

**[09:32]** So again, here is that asymmetry. Slightly easier for Crawling Chaos to obtain this loyalty

**[09:37]** card. They don't have to pay any doom, but they're going to compensate the other players

**[09:40]** with an Elder Sign.

**[09:42]** The ability on the Shadow Pharaoh. I'm going to butcher the pronunciation. Hepafrenia.

**[09:49]** It's an ongoing ability. Gates may not be controlled by any faction in the Shadow Pharaoh's

**[09:54]** area. When the Shadow Pharaoh enters an area, any occupying unit immediately abandons the

**[09:59]** Gate. Yog-Sothoth is unaffected.

**[10:02]** So this unit's pretty cheap, and it's pretty annoying, but it's not useful at all in combat.

**[10:08]** It kind of reminds me of the zoogs from the Dreamlands map, which kick people off of Gates

**[10:13]** that they're in the area with, but the difference here is that this one is under your control

**[10:17]** and it can be moved around.

**[10:20]** This is a nice way to make sure somebody is not in control of a Gate towards the end of

**[10:24]** the action phase. Good against any factions where every Gate counts and they're doom-loving,

**[10:31]** they're trying to perform rituals. This can be a good way to knock somebody off of potentially

**[10:35]** two doom because they won't get the initial doom and they won't get the doom from a ritual.

**[10:39]** I'd say this is less good against fightier factions, which don't care quite as much about

**[10:44]** the doom that they're getting every doom phase, so not great against a Crawling Chaos

**[10:50]** or a Windwalker or a Cthulhu.

**[10:54]** Most appealing, I think this is obviously a Crawling Chaos unit. You can fly it in,

**[10:59]** notably, can move very easily with this. Other factions, I gotta be honest, this one feels

**[11:04]** a little bit sus. I wouldn't really want to pay the doom for this. I've not played a game

**[11:08]** with this one, full disclosure, so I haven't really seen it be used very well, but yeah,

**[11:13]** I have a hard time thinking this one is going to be very effective in the hands of factions

**[11:17]** other than Crawling Chaos, which can fly it into the right position fairly easily.

**[11:24]** The next unit we have to discuss is an independent Great Old One. It is the Bloated Woman. This

**[11:31]** gets my vote for one of the more disturbing-looking sculpts in the entire game. It does, I suppose,

**[11:39]** resemble maybe a woman at one point in time. This does not look like a human. This looks

**[11:44]** like it's much been turned into Narlathotep. It's got a face and a mouth, but immediately

**[11:51]** a second mouth below that on the chest and a third, even larger, grinning mouth in the

**[11:57]** abdomen area. It's got a fan, which I guess is meant to be a disguise, but if you saw

**[12:03]** this, it wouldn't be fooling anyone. You would not think this is a lady. You would think

**[12:06]** this is a monster, and you would run away. Very disgusting, very, very disgusting sculpt.

**[12:12]** I can't emphasize enough. How to awaken the Bloated Woman. She costs four Power. You need

**[12:19]** to have a controlled Gate in an area with your Great Old One. Pay four Power and place

**[12:24]** the Bloated Woman in the area containing the Gate. For Crawling Chaos, pay three Power,

**[12:29]** then place the Bloated Woman at any of your controlled Gates. Then each other faction

**[12:34]** receives one Elder Sign. Crawling Chaos does not need a Great Old One in the area into

**[12:39]** which he awakens the Bloated Woman. So that's pretty handy if this is in the game and you're

**[12:44]** playing Crawling Chaos. You can get this one fairly cheaply. Otherwise, it's going to be

**[12:49]** a pretty mid-costed independent Great Old One for any other faction to get onto their

**[12:54]** team. The Bloated Woman has a combat of one, and her ability is the Velvet Fan. It's a

**[13:01]** post-battle. After any battle involving the Bloated Woman, choose one killed or eliminated

**[13:07]** enemy monster or Cultist and place it on this card. That unit is considered to be out of

**[13:12]** play. If a unit is later recruited or summoned from this card, its owner pays its Power cost

**[13:18]** directly to you. Units remain on this card if the Bloated Woman is killed or eliminated.

**[13:23]** They may still be recruited or summoned from this card, but no one will be paid Power for

**[13:28]** this while she is out of play. If she is returned to play, her controller will receive

**[13:33]** payments as described above. There's no limit to the number of units you may have on this

**[13:37]** card. Pretty interesting ability here. The Bloated Woman is not rolling a lot of dice

**[13:43]** by herself, but if she is able to be part of a larger battle and there's a juicy unit

**[13:48]** that gets killed, keep in mind the controller is going to determine which unit. This is

**[13:52]** a nice way to recoup some Power. If you can keep the Bloated Woman continually sitting

**[13:58]** around in battles, she's going to earn you Power. Notably, like other Great Old Ones,

**[14:03]** if she's killed, she's not loyal to you anymore. Keep that in mind. If she gets killed, those

**[14:08]** units are going to start paying somebody else Power if they're hanging out on her card.

**[14:12]** The Bloated Woman really gets spicy when we start talking about her Spellbook. Her Spellbook

**[14:16]** requirement that you need to earn this Spellbook is just have all six of your Spellbooks. As

**[14:22]** soon as you earn all your books, you earn the Spellbook for Bloated Woman, which is

**[14:26]** Disaster Looms. Gather Power phase. Your controlled Gates now earn one Elder Sign instead of two

**[14:32]** Power. They still earn one doom during the doom phase. This is a crazy ability. I would

**[14:37]** say this is among the strongest abilities from the neutral units in the game. You're

**[14:42]** still going to get your Power from your Acolytes. You're losing out on a lot of Power from your

**[14:46]** Gates, but that's okay because you've got Elder Signs, which is worth even more than

**[14:50]** two Power mainly. If you're on three Gates, getting three Elder Signs is amazing. You're

**[14:54]** somehow able to do a ritual still. Your Gates are also providing you doom, so even on three

**[15:01]** Gates with this, you're earning three doom and three Elder Signs. That's six doom at

**[15:06]** minimum, and if you are able to still ritual, you're probably going to be earning somewhere

**[15:10]** between nine and ten and twelve doom and probably winning the game if you're at anywhere around

**[15:16]** doom with all your books. I really think this one is strong with any faction that can keep

**[15:21]** it alive in a battle, but amazing with, you guessed it, Crawling Chaos because of how

**[15:25]** Crawling Chaos can always get into position.

**[15:27]** with those big battles. Even if you're not initiating a lot of battles, if

**[15:32]** you're able to get that Spellbook Disaster Looms, any faction is going to

**[15:36]** love this. Any Cho-Cho or Ancients or factions that like to do rituals, they're

**[15:41]** going to win the game if they're able to make it to Gather Power with this under

**[15:44]** their control and the Disaster Looms Spellbook, so watch out. I think this is a

**[15:48]** very high value target. If it's not on your side, you should be trying to

**[15:53]** prioritize killing this or the game is probably going to be over. And the last

**[15:58]** unit we have for the Masks of Narlathotep expansion is the Haunter of

**[16:03]** the Dark. It was June that Blake's diary told of his victory over the Cryptogram.

**[16:08]** The text was, he found, in the Dark Aclo language used by certain cults of evil

**[16:13]** antiquity and known to him in a halting way through previous researches. The

**[16:18]** diary is strangely reticent about what Blake deciphered, but he was patently

**[16:22]** awed and disconcerted by his results. There are references to a Haunter of the

**[16:27]** Dark, awaked by gazing into the shining Trapezohedron, and insane conjectures

**[16:32]** about the Black Gulfs of Chaos from which it was called. The being is spoken

**[16:37]** of as holding all knowledge and demanding monstrous sacrifices. Some of

**[16:42]** Blake's entries show fear lest the thing which he seemed to regard as summoned

**[16:47]** stalk abroad, though he adds that the streetlights form a bulwark which

**[16:52]** cannot be crossed. Of this shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it

**[16:58]** a window on all time and space, and tracing its history from the days it was

**[17:03]** fashioned on Dark Yuggoth before ever the Old Ones brought it to Earth. It was

**[17:08]** treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of Antarctica,

**[17:12]** salvaged from their ruins by the serpent men of Volusia, and peered at

**[17:17]** aeons later in Lemuria by the first human beings. It crossed strange lands

**[17:22]** and stranger seas, and sank with Atlantis before a Minoan fisher meshed it in his

**[17:28]** net and sold it to a swarthy merchants from Nighted Kem. The pharaoh Nephron Ka

**[17:33]** built around it a template with a windowless crypt, and did that which

**[17:38]** caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records. Then it slept in

**[17:43]** the ruins of that evil fane which the priest and the new pharaoh destroyed,

**[17:47]** till the Delver spade once more brought it forth to curse mankind. The sculpt for

**[17:53]** this independent Great Old One is awesome. It looks kind of like a cross

**[17:57]** between a bat and some kind of insect, maybe a big fly. It looks very fast. It

**[18:04]** looks like it's ready to just spring right off the base and attack. Really

**[18:08]** reminds me of the story The Haunter in the Dark that it comes from, and I would

**[18:13]** not want to have the lights off and have this anywhere nearby. How to awaken the

**[18:19]** Haunter of the Dark. Your controlled Gate is in an area with your Great Old One.

**[18:22]** K6 Power and place the Haunter of the Dark in the area containing the Gate.

**[18:27]** For Crawling Chaos, K5 Power then place the Haunter of the Dark at one of your

**[18:32]** controlled Gates. Each faction then takes one Elder Sign. Crawling Chaos does not

**[18:37]** need a Great Old One in the area into which he awakens the Haunter of the Dark.

**[18:41]** So this is similar to the Bloated Woman. Crawling Chaos doesn't need to have

**[18:45]** their Great Old One in play to awaken this, but at the cost of giving the other

**[18:50]** players one Elder Sign. Combat is equal to the total number of spell books

**[18:55]** earned by your enemy, including those for any independent Great Old Ones. So this

**[19:00]** is kind of an homage to the combat on Narlathotep itself, kind of half the

**[19:06]** combat of Narlathotep if you will. The ability on the Haunter is fly to the

**[19:11]** light post-battle. If the enemy scored exactly one kill, it must be applied to

**[19:16]** the Haunter. If they score two or more kills, you can apply the kills normally.

**[19:21]** So this makes the Haunter a bit fragile, but assuming it's a big battle and

**[19:27]** there's a lot of fighting going on, you're good. But it's very awkward if

**[19:31]** somebody scores exactly one kill because you probably wasted five or six

**[19:35]** Power awakening this. The Spellbook requirement. As an action, pay one Power.

**[19:41]** This is easy. I don't need to tell you how easy it is to earn their Spellbook,

**[19:46]** which is the Shining Trapezohedron. Free battle ability. In a battle involving the

**[19:51]** Haunter, your enemy must roll a die for each of their units present in the

**[19:55]** battle. For every six rolled by your enemy, that's a kill if you're using the

**[19:59]** battle dice. They must choose to eliminate one of their own units. So I

**[20:04]** would get this Spellbook going as soon as possible, then the frailty that I

**[20:09]** described in Fly to the Light hardly even matters because this can be so

**[20:13]** devastating if you come up with results before a big battle, a decisive battle,

**[20:18]** and totally swing the battle in your favor and just ruin the game for some

**[20:23]** other opponent. As I said, this unit's frail, so just be thinking about when you

**[20:28]** awaken it. Make sure you have the one Power to earn that Shining Trapezohedron

**[20:32]** book, and as soon as you do, I'm not really that worried about it getting

**[20:36]** killed because they're gonna lose something out of it as well, probably

**[20:40]** before the battle even starts. All around, I think this is a strong, independent,

**[20:45]** great old one on offense or defense. Spidey factions are gonna like this, but

**[20:49]** I think this is great for any faction just in general. I don't really have any

**[20:52]** notes here. I've played several games with this one. I've had my game ruined by

**[20:56]** the Shining Trapezohedron, so do not underestimate how many units you can

**[21:01]** potentially lose in a battle with the Haunter of the Dark. That's all the units

**[21:07]** for the masks of Narlathotep expansion, so I'll give you my closing

**[21:12]** thoughts. This one is a very, very cool expansion, if not the most balanced

**[21:17]** expansion. I thought it was very flavorful, and I knew I had to pair this

**[21:21]** with the Crawling Chaos guide and release them at the same time. I just

**[21:25]** love the flavor. I love that Narlathotep shapeshifts and can

**[21:28]** quote-unquote become any of these terrors or great old ones. Asymmetry in

**[21:33]** the summoning and awakening, I'm not sure how balanced that is. I haven't really

**[21:38]** played too many games with all these units to make that determination. I tend

**[21:42]** to think that it is definitely favoring Crawling Chaos if they're in the game

**[21:47]** with them, but that is neutrals. I think they're inherently a little unbalanced,

**[21:51]** and that's okay if you know that going in. I wouldn't call this an essential

**[21:55]** expansion for you to own in your Cthulhu Wars collection, but if you like

**[21:59]** Narlathotep, if you like the stories and the lore around Narlathotep, give it a go

**[22:04]** at least once, at least so you can see how crazy the Bloated Woman and

**[22:09]** the Haunter of the Dark are. As I said, I'm not sold on the Shadow Pharaoh, but

**[22:14]** those independent great old ones are pretty spicy. Dark demons add an

**[22:18]** interesting dimension to the game. At some point I'm gonna make this hateful game

**[22:22]** full of hateful neutrals, and I will report on it in an episode, and you can

**[22:27]** enjoy that. Maybe I'll interview the participants of that game, and they can

**[22:30]** tell you how miserable they were. That's another episode in the books, so thank

**[22:35]** you for listening. Please join the Cthulhu Wars Discord. You can find me on

**[22:39]** Discord at Kilogram. Please reach out, say hello, try to find a game with me. I'm

**[22:43]** always looking for games on the weekends, so have a great morning, have a great

**[22:48]** afternoon, have a great evening, wherever it is that you are. Thanks, bye.
