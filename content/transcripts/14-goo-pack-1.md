## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:23]** My name's Graham, I'll be your host. Hope you're doing well. We've got some pretty mild weather this week where I am, so I'm kind of enjoying that it's cool, but not quite snowing.

**[00:36]** Speaking of snow, found out about something pretty cool recently. Shoutout to Coito from Cthulhu Wars Discord for posting about this, otherwise I would have never known about it.

**[00:48]** There's a French illustrator named Francois Berenger. Not sure how to say that. Not very French, sorry.

**[00:56]** I guess they're a pretty well-renowned illustrator, but anyway, this person has made several books now.

**[01:05]** It's the text of an H.P. Lovecraft story, some famous ones.

**[01:10]** They've covered Call of Cthulhu, Mountains of Madness, that's what Coito was posting about, and I think they also have plans to do the Dunwich Horror.

**[01:19]** Essentially, it's a huge book with the text from the story, accompanied by very large, colorful images, so I have already told my wife, put this down on the birthday list for me, because this seems like a very cool thing.

**[01:34]** You should definitely check that out. I'm pretty excited for the Dunwich Horror one to come out in English, I guess. That's my favorite H.P. Lovecraft story.

**[01:42]** Anyway, that's enough news. News to me, not really breaking news.

**[01:48]** What are we here for today? We're doing another episode on neutral units, this time covering the Great Old One Pack 1,

**[01:56]** which contains five independent Great Old Ones for you to add to your games of Cthulhu Wars.

**[02:05]** Let's get into it and start discussing our first unit.

**[02:08]** Here, it seemed, was the source of all miscreation and abomination.

**[02:16]** For the gray mass quabbled and quivered, and swelled perpetually, and from it, in manifold fission, were spawned the anatomies that crept away on every side through the grotto.

**[02:27]** There were things like bodiless legs or arms that flailed in the slime, or heads that rolled, or floundering bellies with vicious fins,

**[02:35]** and all manner of things malformed and monstrous, that grew in size as they departed from the neighborhood of Aboth.

**[02:42]** And those that swam not swiftly ashore when they fell into the pool from Aboth were devoured by mouths that gaped in the parent bulk.

**[02:50]** Our first unit we'll be discussing is the independent Great Old One Aboth.

**[02:57]** You heard me reading just now from a pretty obscure story by Clark Ashton Smith,

**[03:03]** The Seven Gases.

**[03:05]** Gash?

**[03:06]** It's like an Irish folklore thing.

**[03:09]** I'm not sure exactly what the rules are.

**[03:11]** It's pretty much like a curse that you put on somebody.

**[03:13]** Like, they're compelled to do a thing.

**[03:15]** If they don't do it, there's, like, big consequences.

**[03:19]** So, Seven Gashes by Clark Ashton Smith.

**[03:22]** It's actually not the last time we'll be mentioning that story when we discuss independent Great Old Ones,

**[03:28]** but that's for another episode.

**[03:29]** Here we've got Aboth, the source of uncleanliness, the unclean one.

**[03:35]** The sculpt for this one is pretty gross.

**[03:38]** It looks like somebody's organs and brain, like, crawling out of a bubbling pool or something,

**[03:47]** but they don't have any of their skeleton or skin visible.

**[03:50]** So you've got, like, the torso and brain crawling out,

**[03:55]** and then you've got a lot of, like, squiggly, tentacle things around it.

**[04:01]** Some of them look exactly like I've just described from the story.

**[04:04]** Some look like legs.

**[04:05]** Some look like arms.

**[04:06]** Ugh, but yeah, this thing is just a big, nasty brain on a stick.

**[04:12]** Definitely looks unclean.

**[04:15]** How to awaken Abhoth.

**[04:17]** Cost 4 Power.

**[04:19]** Your controlled area must be in a Gate with your Great Old One.

**[04:22]** Pay 4 Power, and you'll place Abhoth in the area containing the Gate.

**[04:27]** The combat for Abhoth equals the number of filth tokens in play between 0 and 12.

**[04:33]** And the ability for Abhoth?

**[04:36]** Filth.

**[04:37]** A 1 cost action.

**[04:39]** Place a filth token in any area.

**[04:42]** Filth tokens act as combat 0 monsters.

**[04:45]** They belong to Abhoth's faction, but never move nor take actions.

**[04:50]** They can be killed or pained normally in battle, and are affected by Spellbooks and abilities.

**[04:54]** Got the 3 dimensional filth token here as well.

**[04:59]** Uh, yep.

**[05:00]** Looks like filth.

**[05:02]** Is this filth like dirty, muddy filth?

**[05:05]** Is it like poop?

**[05:07]** I'm not really sure.

**[05:08]** You can decide for yourself.

**[05:09]** I'm gonna go with the former.

**[05:11]** Let's break down this filth ability and the filth tokens.

**[05:16]** I actually think this ability is really strong.

**[05:19]** 1 cost action.

**[05:21]** You can place a filth, a 0 cost monster, in any area.

**[05:25]** We all love the safe battling when we have lots of bodies in our side to soak up kills.

**[05:30]** There's nothing here that says filth tokens can't be placed in the same area, so you can

**[05:36]** place as many of them in one place as you need.

**[05:38]** You might want to spread them out, I'll get to that in a minute, but you could stack them

**[05:42]** up in one place, and then whatever you have there, whatever important units you have there,

**[05:47]** they feel like they're pretty safe from battling.

**[05:51]** So your filth can be battled away, that's fine.

**[05:53]** I feel like it's gonna feel like kind of a waste of time to battle the filth away.

**[05:59]** You're gonna want to do that if you're fighting against Abhoth.

**[06:02]** Yeah, the more filth that's out there, the stronger Abhoth is gonna be.

**[06:05]** I can't imagine somebody getting all the way to 12 filth, but I'm sure that it can happen,

**[06:10]** and it's probably pretty scary when it does.

**[06:13]** Filth become a lot more scary when Abhoth earns their Spellbook, so let me go over the

**[06:19]** requirement for that.

**[06:20]** Choose one.

**[06:21]** Either your faction has four or more different monster types in play, including filth tokens,

**[06:27]** or your faction has eight or more total monsters in play, including filth tokens.

**[06:31]** Why is it a choice? That's because not every faction has four different monsters, so think of

**[06:37]** like Chocho, they only have one. They're gonna need to have eight total monsters in play.

**[06:42]** So just making it so every faction can earn this Spellbook.

**[06:46]** And the Spellbook is the Brood, ongoing ability.

**[06:49]** Gates in areas containing filth tokens do not count during the doom phase.

**[06:53]** This does not apply to Abhoth's faction.

**[06:56]** Wow. So if the filth weren't annoying enough by just being around and taking up space and

**[07:02]** putting bodies in the battle, if you earn this Spellbook, the Brood, they'll suddenly be

**[07:08]** just stopping Gates from producing doom, which is a huge deal.

**[07:13]** If you get this, your opponents are gonna have to spend their time fighting and killing filth.

**[07:18]** If they don't, they're just straight up not winning the game.

**[07:20]** They're not getting any doom.

**[07:22]** It doesn't affect you, so you can feel free to stack up filth in any of your Gates.

**[07:28]** It makes your Gates even less desirable than before, because now you'll have to spend time

**[07:34]** chopping through all that filth just to get to your Gate, probably.

**[07:38]** It needs to just be completely clear of filth, because if it isn't, you're just not going to be

**[07:43]** earning doom for it.

**[07:46]** What factions like this great old one?

**[07:47]** Honestly, I feel like every faction likes this.

**[07:50]** It's just a pretty strong ability to have essentially 12 more monsters in your pool that you can

**[07:55]** deploy.

**[07:56]** No, they don't have any combat.

**[07:58]** It doesn't matter that they can't move.

**[07:59]** You can put them into any area that you want to, and they're just going to become a huge

**[08:04]** threat as the game goes on.

**[08:06]** If you earn this Spellbook, it's more like when you earn this Spellbook.

**[08:09]** As long as you're keeping Abhoth safe, you can just keep stacking filth in one place if

**[08:13]** you need to until you earn this book.

**[08:16]** And once you do, everybody needs to be on guard.

**[08:19]** You're going to be able to tax the players among any location on the map, force them to spend

**[08:25]** their Power fighting filth tokens when they probably have better things to do, like earning

**[08:30]** their Spellbooks, fighting you, killing Abhoth.

**[08:34]** Pretty annoying to play against.

**[08:36]** I've played against this one several times, and yeah, if everyone doesn't cooperate to

**[08:41]** take down the filth tokens, it becomes a problem very quickly.

**[08:44]** All right, moving on to our next independent great old one, we've got Cthuga.

**[08:54]** There's a couple stories I wanted to read before this episode.

**[08:57]** I actually didn't own any book or collection where they came from, but I've fixed that problem.

**[09:03]** I wanted to go ahead and record this episode anyway.

**[09:05]** Cthuga was created by August Durlith.

**[09:09]** I think first appearing in a story called The House on Kerwin Street.

**[09:13]** I believe also in another story by Durlith later.

**[09:17]** Dweller in Darkness, I think it's called.

**[09:19]** And I think there's some other authors that have used Cthuga as well.

**[09:24]** I'm pretty sure Cthuga's name sounds like an offspring of Cthulhu.

**[09:29]** If I'm wrong about that, somebody please write me in and tell me.

**[09:32]** I haven't read the source material.

**[09:35]** I know Durlith was trying to continue on the Cthulhu mythos after Lovecraft had passed on.

**[09:44]** I don't know much about Cthuga, but I do know it's supposed to be like a living flame,

**[09:50]** and that's pretty much what the sculpt looks like too.

**[09:52]** Looks like maybe some stones floating amidst some flame, but yeah, it just kind of looks like

**[10:00]** a big fireball.

**[10:03]** Maybe it has like stones for eyes.

**[10:05]** I'm not really sure.

**[10:07]** Kind of looks like a fireball or like a vegetable or something.

**[10:11]** Maybe like a Brussels sprout.

**[10:12]** Probably not that though.

**[10:13]** Probably a fireball.

**[10:16]** How to Awaken Cthuga.

**[10:18]** Ooh, interesting cost here.

**[10:20]** Nominal cost 6.

**[10:23]** Good Scrabble word.

**[10:25]** Your controlled Gate is in an area with your Great Old One, number 1.

**[10:29]** Pay Power equal to 6 minus your Great Old One's Awakening Power cost.

**[10:35]** If the result is negative, gain the result in Power.

**[10:38]** And number 3, replace your Great Old One with Cthuga.

**[10:43]** That's pretty strange, so before we go any further, let's break down these Awakening requirements

**[10:49]** a little bit.

**[10:49]** You're going to have to lose your Great Old One and replace it with Cthuga.

**[10:53]** That's not ideal.

**[10:56]** However, the more expensive your Great Old One is, the more of a discount you get on Cthuga,

**[11:01]** or maybe even a full-on refund in Power.

**[11:05]** Supposing we want to Awaken Cthuga and we have Haster, we would pay 6 minus our Great Old

**[11:14]** One's Awakening cost, which is 10.

**[11:16]** So the result would be negative.

**[11:17]** So we would gain 4 Power out of this, and then we would lose Haster and replace him with Cthuga.

**[11:25]** And have 4 Power left to do something else with.

**[11:28]** Maybe we can reawaken.

**[11:29]** I think the more expensive Great Old Ones are pretty valuable, that's why they're that expensive.

**[11:37]** So yes, you'll get a refund.

**[11:39]** Seems maybe a little sus to get rid of a Shub or something like that just to get Cthuga,

**[11:45]** though the benefits are very much there.

**[11:50]** Combat of Cthuga equals the combat of an enemy Great Old One in the battle.

**[11:55]** Your choice.

**[11:55]** If none are present, Cthuga's combat is 0.

**[11:59]** So Cthuga could potentially be rolling a lot of dice.

**[12:02]** You know, if Narlathotep is in the battle, for example, at full strength,

**[12:06]** Cthuga is also going to be rolling 12 dice, so that's pretty nice.

**[12:10]** The ability on Cthuga, Fire Vampires, its post-battle ability.

**[12:14]** If Cthuga is involved in a battle, after all kill results are assigned,

**[12:19]** but before they're applied, you may choose to spare one or more enemy units

**[12:24]** by reducing their kill to a pain instead.

**[12:27]** For each enemy unit you spare in this way, you gain one Power.

**[12:31]** You cannot use Fire Vampires or Firestorm, the Spellbook, we'll get to that,

**[12:37]** against an enemy player with zero Power or a hibernating Windwalker.

**[12:41]** If you can use this ability and get into some battles where you're scoring some kills,

**[12:46]** you're going to get refunded even more Power from Cthuga,

**[12:50]** so maybe it's fine that you chose to swap your expensive Great Old One.

**[12:56]** This will pay back that Power pretty quickly if you're able to survive like two or three battles.

**[13:02]** Hopefully you didn't have to spend a lot of Power moving and fighting those battles.

**[13:07]** Hopefully you're breaking even here, more or less.

**[13:09]** And Cthuga has a Spellbook, so what is the requirement for getting it?

**[13:14]** Kill an enemy Great Old One in battle.

**[13:17]** Cool, sometimes that's easier said than done, but let's assume that we did that.

**[13:22]** We will have earned this Spellbook for Cthuga, which is Firestorm.

**[13:27]** Post-battle.

**[13:28]** If Cthuga is involved in a battle, for each killed enemy unit you spare,

**[13:32]** you also gain one Elder Sign.

**[13:35]** Wow, so this Spellbook is insanely good.

**[13:38]** If you get Cthuga, if you are able to awaken it, try to keep it alive, make sure you earn this book,

**[13:45]** and then assuming you've earned your Spellbooks, I would just be going around the map getting as many fights as possible.

**[13:51]** Let's say you fight two significant battles, and then you spare two units per battle.

**[13:57]** That's four Elder Signs.

**[13:58]** That's a lot of Doom.

**[14:00]** That's probably around five Doom, maybe more like seven Doom.

**[14:05]** Crawling Chaos loves to get that amount of Elder Signs in and try to win the game with Harbinger.

**[14:10]** I think this one is really, really good.

**[14:12]** Also another really strong, generally strong Great Old One here.

**[14:16]** Which factions prefer it?

**[14:18]** I would say the fighty factions.

**[14:21]** So any faction that has a good way to move around a bunch of units and get into that fight.

**[14:27]** Cthuga loves to just roll up on people as part of a giant death ball.

**[14:32]** Windwalker likes this.

**[14:34]** Cthulhu with Submerge likes this quite a bit.

**[14:37]** And yeah, of course, Crawling Chaos itself, very adept at finding and killing Great Old Ones.

**[14:43]** Cthuga would also fit right in with this faction.

**[14:46]** And again, you've got an expensive Great Old One, but you'll be getting paid back for Power.

**[14:51]** And if you can ever have Crawling Chaos and Cthuga at the same time,

**[14:56]** and you manage to get Harbinger and Firestorm going,

**[15:00]** you're just going to be getting so many Elder Signs, it's going to be actually disgusting.

**[15:03]** Easily.

**[15:04]** Could get 10 Doom in a couple of battles, no problem.

**[15:09]** Another very strong Great Old One.

**[15:11]** Definitely want to check this one out.

**[15:13]** I've played with it a couple of times.

**[15:15]** What I haven't played with is some of the new factions.

**[15:18]** I'd really like to see this one with, like,

**[15:20]** Demon Sultan seems like it could get up to some shenanigans with this one.

**[15:24]** Here's the elevator pitch.

**[15:26]** We're cool.

**[15:27]** We know we're going to get Cthuga.

**[15:28]** That's the one that we want to buy, the independent Great Old One.

**[15:31]** So we awaken Thesis for 8 Power.

**[15:35]** Later, we awaken Cthuga.

**[15:39]** So we'll pay 6 minus your Great Old One's awakening Power cost, which I believe would be 8.

**[15:45]** We'll get a 2 Power refund there.

**[15:48]** We'll have to replace Thesis with Cthuga.

**[15:50]** So sad, but not really.

**[15:52]** Because Thesis, as we know from the Demon Sultan guide,

**[15:56]** you can pay any Power you want for Thesis between 0 and 8.

**[15:59]** So you could pay 8 for Thesis, get a Cthuga, get 2 Power back,

**[16:04]** and then awaken Thesis for, like, 0 or 1.

**[16:07]** Effectively, Cthuga's cost us 0 Power to awaken,

**[16:12]** and we've still got Thesis kicking around,

**[16:14]** albeit rolling a little bit less dice.

**[16:16]** Let's move on to another Great Old One here.

**[16:23]** Both of you know, ran part of the long letter,

**[16:29]** how much truth there is often to be found behind old legend and folklore.

**[16:33]** The Cyclops is no longer a myth,

**[16:35]** as any doctor familiar with monstrous births can tell you.

**[16:39]** And you know how my theories regarding the Elixir Vitae

**[16:43]** have been confirmed by the discovery of heavy water.

**[16:46]** Well, the myth of the Hydra is based on such a truth.

**[16:49]** There are innumerable tales of multi-headed monsters,

**[16:54]** all springing from the actual entity,

**[16:56]** of whose real existence a very few have known through the ages.

**[17:00]** This creature did not originate on Earth,

**[17:02]** but in the gulfs outside.

**[17:04]** It was, after fashion, a vampiric entity,

**[17:08]** living not on the blood of its victims,

**[17:09]** but on their heads, their brains.

**[17:12]** This may sound strange to you,

**[17:14]** but you know by this time that there are beings outside

**[17:16]** whose needs and flesh are not as ours.

**[17:20]** Through the eons,

**[17:21]** this entity has ravened in the abyss beyond our dimension,

**[17:24]** sending out its call to claim victims where it could.

**[17:27]** For this entity,

**[17:29]** by absorbing the heads and brains of intelligent creatures,

**[17:32]** both of this world and of other planets,

**[17:34]** emerges with its Powers and vitality greatly augmented.

**[17:37]** That's right, the third great old one we'll be discussing is Mother Hydra.

**[17:45]** This one's from the story Hydra by Henry Kuttner.

**[17:49]** Sculpt looks like, uh, you know,

**[17:54]** Cthulhu Wars' nightmare little mermaid.

**[17:59]** Mermaid body,

**[18:00]** got big old webbed hands and claws,

**[18:04]** some scary hair,

**[18:06]** looks like,

**[18:08]** ooh,

**[18:08]** like six eyes,

**[18:11]** three on each side of the face,

**[18:13]** and a big nasty underbiting jaw.

**[18:16]** Don't want to swim with this one nearby.

**[18:21]** Hydra is like another entity

**[18:23]** kind of worshipped by the Deep Ones alongside Dagon.

**[18:27]** Arkham Horror has a great campaign,

**[18:29]** Innsmouth Conspiracy,

**[18:30]** where,

**[18:31]** no spoilers,

**[18:32]** you might run into Hydra,

**[18:34]** you might also run into Dagon there.

**[18:37]** Father Dagon is another great old one we'll talk about later.

**[18:42]** How do we awaken Mother Hydra?

**[18:45]** Cost for your controlled Gate is in an area with your great old one.

**[18:49]** Pay for Power,

**[18:50]** place Mother Hydra in the area containing the Gate.

**[18:54]** Combat for Mother Hydra is six,

**[18:56]** minus the number of enemy units in the area,

**[18:59]** to a minimum of one.

**[19:01]** So Mother Hydra does not like to be around enemy units.

**[19:03]** Okay.

**[19:04]** And the ability is

**[19:06]** the Agony Sting.

**[19:07]** It's a one-cost action.

**[19:09]** Choose any ocean area.

**[19:11]** All enemy Cultists in that area

**[19:13]** must be moved to adjacent land areas by their owners.

**[19:17]** Your Cultists are immune.

**[19:19]** In a dispute over who moves first,

**[19:21]** you decide.

**[19:23]** Kind of a strange ability.

**[19:25]** Doesn't seem that useful at first glance.

**[19:27]** When you awaken this,

**[19:29]** if you know there are people that have Gates in the ocean,

**[19:33]** okay, then you're in business.

**[19:35]** It's not going to be impossible to find enemy Cultists

**[19:38]** to move out of the ocean.

**[19:40]** So keep in mind,

**[19:41]** like, you can move them out of any ocean area.

**[19:44]** It doesn't need to be where Hydra is currently.

**[19:47]** Any ocean area will do,

**[19:48]** though the controllers will get to choose

**[19:51]** which adjacent land area

**[19:53]** those Cultists are moved to.

**[19:55]** Kind of a strange ability,

**[19:58]** but let's see how it gels

**[19:59]** with the Spellbook requirement.

**[20:01]** Choose one.

**[20:02]** Either control no great old ones in ocean areas

**[20:05]** or enemy factions control

**[20:08]** no great old ones in ocean areas.

**[20:11]** Simple enough.

**[20:11]** If you're not already in the ocean,

**[20:14]** it's going to be pretty easy to earn this Spellbook.

**[20:16]** If Cthulhu is not in the game,

**[20:18]** there might just straight up

**[20:19]** not be anybody in the ocean already

**[20:21]** and you will earn this book like immediately.

**[20:23]** So that's something to keep in mind.

**[20:26]** It's going to be a lot more difficult to earn this

**[20:27]** if Cthulhu is in the game.

**[20:30]** And the Spellbook that works with Mother Hydra

**[20:32]** is the Zygote.

**[20:34]** It's a one cost action.

**[20:35]** Take all the acolyte Cultists in your pool

**[20:38]** and place them on the map

**[20:39]** in any areas in which you have a unit.

**[20:42]** Normally we want to stagger our actions.

**[20:44]** So I would say like,

**[20:46]** why recruit all of your Cultists at one time?

**[20:48]** You could be, you know,

**[20:49]** spreading that out over time.

**[20:51]** I still think that's true,

**[20:52]** but there's something to be said for like,

**[20:55]** boom, like one cost, one time,

**[20:58]** get a bunch of bodies in the area at once.

**[21:01]** Not only in one single area,

**[21:02]** but distribute it across any areas

**[21:05]** in which you have a unit.

**[21:06]** This is not restricted to land or ocean areas.

**[21:09]** It can be any unit on the map.

**[21:11]** Basically fill in the rest of your Cultists

**[21:14]** from your pool.

**[21:16]** You can really defend your Gates

**[21:18]** very easily with this.

**[21:20]** Properly be set up to pay for the dreams tax

**[21:23]** with just a one cost action.

**[21:25]** Really, really good.

**[21:28]** Witch factions like Mother Hydra.

**[21:30]** I would say, honestly,

**[21:32]** the one that is the best that stands out to me

**[21:34]** and it's like a flavor win as well

**[21:36]** would be Cthulhu.

**[21:38]** People are not going to want to be in the ocean

**[21:40]** if Cthulhu is in the game

**[21:41]** and if you get this,

**[21:42]** you'll pretty much get the spell book immediately.

**[21:45]** Cthulhu has a super easy time earning this book,

**[21:48]** but also the Zygote is a great combo

**[21:51]** with Shogoths,

**[21:52]** which want to absorb your acolytes.

**[21:55]** If you can start getting some crazy

**[21:56]** absorb plays going on

**[21:58]** with the Zygote,

**[21:59]** you could be rolling, you know,

**[22:01]** let's just be generous.

**[22:02]** Like, you're holding onto two Gates

**[22:04]** and you're just Zygoting over and over again

**[22:07]** and fighting with absorb.

**[22:08]** That's still four acolytes

**[22:11]** and, you know, 12 dice

**[22:13]** for your absorbent Shogoths.

**[22:15]** That's no joke.

**[22:15]** That's a lot of combat dice.

**[22:17]** I really, really like the Zygote

**[22:18]** for that reason.

**[22:21]** Other factions that might like this

**[22:22]** may be Yellow Sign

**[22:24]** once you have Passion.

**[22:26]** Any factions that like having

**[22:29]** their Cultists be killed

**[22:31]** or put in their pool

**[22:32]** will like this.

**[22:34]** I think Black Go

**[22:34]** would like this as well.

**[22:36]** Another one I'm thinking about

**[22:37]** would be Opener of the Way.

**[22:39]** With your million favored ones,

**[22:41]** put four acolytes back into your pool

**[22:43]** in order to turn them into mutants

**[22:44]** at some point.

**[22:45]** You can just Zygote them right back.

**[22:47]** Next action,

**[22:48]** that seems really strong.

**[22:50]** Yeah, another great addition

**[22:52]** to your neutral lineup with this one.

**[22:55]** I've played a couple games

**[22:56]** with Mother Hydra.

**[22:57]** I think I want to see it

**[22:58]** a little bit more.

**[23:00]** The Agony Sting

**[23:00]** I've certainly not seen

**[23:02]** be super effective.

**[23:03]** But as we've discussed,

**[23:05]** I think the main attraction here

**[23:06]** is the Zygote.

**[23:07]** And a lot of factions

**[23:08]** will like this.

**[23:09]** Even if you're not like

**[23:10]** somebody really, really

**[23:12]** taking advantage of the Zygote,

**[23:13]** it's nice to be able to like

**[23:15]** you need to protect

**[23:16]** your great old one,

**[23:17]** whatever that is.

**[23:18]** A Demon Sultan, Avatar,

**[23:19]** or a weak Ubo Safla

**[23:21]** and everyone's coming after you.

**[23:23]** It's really nice to be able

**[23:25]** to just all of a sudden

**[23:26]** plop like three or four

**[23:28]** Cultists into the area

**[23:30]** and you're good,

**[23:31]** you're protected.

**[23:32]** It's going to take a lot

**[23:33]** to like crack through

**[23:34]** that wall of bodies

**[23:35]** and expose the valuable units.

**[23:41]** Alright, let's move on

**[23:42]** to our fourth great old one.

**[23:44]** We've got,

**[23:45]** hopefully I'm saying this right,

**[23:46]** Chagnar Falgan.

**[23:49]** Chagnar looks like

**[23:51]** a nasty meditating elephant.

**[23:54]** Maybe like a bizarro version

**[23:57]** of like the god Ganesh.

**[24:00]** Yeah, but it's got a very like

**[24:02]** oof, bat-like elephant ears.

**[24:05]** The elephant trunk

**[24:06]** looks more like a leech

**[24:09]** on the end with some teeth.

**[24:11]** Got nasty folds all over it.

**[24:15]** Maybe some boils.

**[24:17]** Sitting on a rock

**[24:18]** covered in runes.

**[24:21]** It's got its hands up

**[24:21]** like it's vibing.

**[24:23]** It's thinking about

**[24:23]** thinking about how to

**[24:25]** screw you over.

**[24:26]** I, uh,

**[24:27]** I have not a fan of this one.

**[24:29]** I've played with it before.

**[24:30]** We'll get to it.

**[24:31]** We'll get to it.

**[24:33]** This great old one

**[24:34]** is from a story

**[24:35]** called The Horror

**[24:36]** in the Hills

**[24:37]** by Frank Belknap Long,

**[24:42]** another contemporary

**[24:43]** of Lovecraft

**[24:45]** who we've not talked about.

**[24:46]** I've not read this story

**[24:48]** or many of Frank's stories.

**[24:50]** So I've actually

**[24:51]** got the book ordered

**[24:52]** which contains the story

**[24:54]** I'll be reading it.

**[24:55]** But yeah,

**[24:55]** I didn't want to like

**[24:56]** delay this episode

**[24:56]** just because I haven't read

**[24:57]** some of the text.

**[24:58]** So if you want to read about it,

**[25:00]** that's where to find it.

**[25:02]** How to Awaken

**[25:03]** Chagnar Falgun.

**[25:05]** Cost four.

**[25:06]** Your controlled Gate

**[25:07]** is in an area

**[25:08]** with your great old one.

**[25:10]** Pay four Power.

**[25:11]** Place Chagnar Falgun

**[25:12]** in the area

**[25:13]** containing your Gate.

**[25:15]** Just a flat three combat

**[25:17]** on this one.

**[25:18]** And the ability

**[25:19]** is Miuri Nigri.

**[25:21]** Ongoing ability.

**[25:23]** In a battle

**[25:23]** taking place

**[25:24]** in an area

**[25:25]** with your controlled Gate

**[25:26]** had plus three

**[25:27]** combat dice.

**[25:29]** So pretty nice.

**[25:30]** At a glance,

**[25:32]** this seems like

**[25:32]** a pretty good rate.

**[25:34]** You're paying

**[25:34]** four for another

**[25:36]** great old one

**[25:37]** whose combat is three.

**[25:38]** Four cost unit,

**[25:39]** three combat.

**[25:40]** That's not bad

**[25:40]** by itself.

**[25:42]** But if you're ever

**[25:43]** fighting at a controlled Gate,

**[25:44]** you're having a

**[25:45]** four cost unit

**[25:46]** that rolls

**[25:47]** six dice.

**[25:48]** I'm feeling it.

**[25:49]** I like that rate a lot.

**[25:52]** Spellbook requirement

**[25:53]** for Chagnar.

**[25:55]** Very strange.

**[25:56]** As you're action

**[25:57]** for a round,

**[25:58]** discard two Elder Signs.

**[25:59]** You receive

**[26:00]** no doom for them.

**[26:02]** This may seem obvious,

**[26:04]** but yeah,

**[26:04]** try to make those

**[26:05]** be ones

**[26:06]** because you're not

**[26:07]** going to earn

**[26:07]** any doom for them.

**[26:09]** What do you get

**[26:10]** for giving up

**[26:10]** two or more doom?

**[26:12]** You get the Spellbook

**[26:13]** of Chagnar

**[26:15]** called

**[26:15]** The Curse of Chagnar

**[26:17]** Fogon.

**[26:18]** Take a drink

**[26:18]** every time I say

**[26:19]** Chagnar Fogon,

**[26:20]** okay?

**[26:21]** It's an ongoing ability.

**[26:23]** Turn all Elder Signs

**[26:24]** in the pool face up.

**[26:26]** When any player

**[26:26]** receives an Elder Sign,

**[26:27]** you pick which one

**[26:28]** they receive.

**[26:29]** If you lose

**[26:30]** this Spellbook,

**[26:31]** turn all the Elder Signs

**[26:32]** face down again

**[26:33]** and mix them up.

**[26:34]** I'll do a dramatic

**[26:35]** pause there.

**[26:36]** Let that one

**[26:37]** sink in

**[26:37]** a little bit.

**[26:41]** If you get this book,

**[26:42]** the Elder Signs

**[26:42]** are no longer

**[26:43]** a mystery to anyone.

**[26:45]** You get to see them all.

**[26:47]** Not only do you

**[26:47]** see them all,

**[26:48]** you control exactly

**[26:50]** which Elder Signs

**[26:52]** players are getting.

**[26:54]** For you,

**[26:55]** the rest of the game,

**[26:56]** assuming you control

**[26:57]** Chagnar and nothing

**[26:57]** happens,

**[26:58]** you're just going to

**[26:59]** give yourself threes

**[27:00]** every single time.

**[27:01]** And unless people

**[27:03]** are doing nice

**[27:04]** things for you

**[27:05]** or they're doing

**[27:05]** favors for you,

**[27:06]** they're probably

**[27:07]** getting a one

**[27:08]** and that feels

**[27:09]** pretty bad.

**[27:10]** I've played

**[27:12]** several games

**[27:13]** with this one.

**[27:13]** I do not like

**[27:15]** this one.

**[27:15]** I'm not saying

**[27:16]** it's bad to include

**[27:17]** in your games.

**[27:17]** I'm saying

**[27:18]** I've been frustrated

**[27:19]** by this one

**[27:20]** personally when

**[27:21]** I've seen it

**[27:21]** in play.

**[27:22]** I think ideally

**[27:24]** you're using

**[27:25]** this one

**[27:25]** politically

**[27:26]** and you're

**[27:27]** telling people

**[27:28]** they're getting

**[27:29]** twos and threes

**[27:29]** if they're doing

**[27:30]** your bidding,

**[27:31]** but every time

**[27:32]** I've seen this one

**[27:33]** what tends to

**[27:33]** happen is kind

**[27:34]** of what I've

**[27:35]** described.

**[27:36]** Chagnar's controller

**[27:37]** is like greedily

**[27:38]** giving themselves

**[27:39]** threes

**[27:40]** and people

**[27:41]** are earning

**[27:41]** Elder Signs

**[27:42]** for whatever

**[27:42]** reason and

**[27:43]** they're hopefully

**[27:43]** asking like

**[27:44]** what am I

**[27:46]** going to earn

**[27:46]** and the Chagnar

**[27:47]** player is like

**[27:47]** let me think

**[27:48]** about it

**[27:48]** and then they're

**[27:49]** just like

**[27:49]** you're earning

**[27:50]** a one

**[27:50]** just like

**[27:51]** you thought

**[27:51]** you were.

**[27:53]** Very frustrating

**[27:54]** to play against

**[27:54]** once Chagnar's

**[27:56]** earned this book

**[27:56]** so I would

**[27:57]** recommend

**[27:57]** killing this one

**[27:59]** ASAP if you

**[28:00]** can.

**[28:00]** Prevent Chagnar's

**[28:01]** controller from

**[28:02]** having this spell

**[28:03]** book.

**[28:04]** Just prevent them

**[28:05]** from getting it

**[28:06]** in the first place

**[28:07]** but take it away

**[28:08]** from them as

**[28:08]** soon as you

**[28:09]** can.

**[28:10]** Which factions

**[28:11]** like this great

**[28:12]** old one?

**[28:12]** I would say

**[28:13]** probably all of

**[28:15]** them again but

**[28:15]** especially a

**[28:17]** ritual loving

**[28:18]** doom loving

**[28:19]** faction especially

**[28:20]** one with multiple

**[28:21]** great old ones

**[28:22]** like a yellow

**[28:23]** sign or a

**[28:23]** Windwalker or

**[28:24]** a demon

**[28:25]** sultan.

**[28:26]** If you can

**[28:26]** manage to

**[28:27]** ritual while you

**[28:28]** have the curse

**[28:29]** of Chagnar

**[28:29]** fogging game's

**[28:30]** probably just over

**[28:31]** because you will

**[28:32]** have just gained

**[28:33]** like you know

**[28:34]** six or nine

**[28:35]** doom in demon

**[28:36]** sultan's case you

**[28:37]** could just take

**[28:37]** three threes.

**[28:38]** That's extremely

**[28:39]** gross.

**[28:40]** This one is like

**[28:41]** public enemy number

**[28:42]** one if it ever

**[28:43]** comes out.

**[28:44]** I've played this

**[28:45]** one in real life

**[28:46]** with my group and

**[28:47]** everybody was

**[28:47]** extremely unhappy

**[28:48]** after the game

**[28:49]** because we were

**[28:50]** not able to kill

**[28:51]** Chagnar once the

**[28:53]** controller got this

**[28:54]** book and yeah

**[28:55]** the controller of

**[28:57]** Chagnar will win

**[28:58]** every game if they

**[29:00]** are not stopped

**[29:01]** once they get this

**[29:02]** book.

**[29:02]** So you've been

**[29:03]** warned.

**[29:06]** And the final

**[29:08]** independent great

**[29:09]** old one here we

**[29:10]** have Yig,

**[29:11]** the father of

**[29:12]** serpents.

**[29:13]** This one comes

**[29:14]** from I think a

**[29:15]** couple of stories

**[29:16]** but mainly the

**[29:17]** story The Mound

**[29:18]** which H.P.

**[29:19]** Lovecraft wrote

**[29:20]** with I believe

**[29:21]** Zelia Bishop or

**[29:23]** maybe it was

**[29:23]** ghostwritten.

**[29:25]** I try to find

**[29:26]** like a nice

**[29:27]** chunk of

**[29:28]** paragraph that

**[29:28]** goes over

**[29:29]** whatever entity

**[29:31]** whatever monster

**[29:31]** The Mound has

**[29:32]** a lot.

**[29:34]** I wanted to

**[29:34]** choose a

**[29:34]** conversation but

**[29:35]** it was a bit

**[29:36]** of a caricature

**[29:37]** of a Native

**[29:39]** American person

**[29:40]** describing Yig.

**[29:42]** Pretty much what

**[29:42]** you need to know

**[29:43]** about Yig is

**[29:44]** he's the father

**[29:45]** of serpents.

**[29:45]** If you step

**[29:46]** on a snake

**[29:47]** he's going to

**[29:48]** come for you.

**[29:49]** You're probably

**[29:49]** going to get

**[29:50]** turned into a

**[29:51]** serpent and

**[29:52]** that is a bad

**[29:53]** time for you.

**[29:54]** Not fully a snake

**[29:55]** but not fully a

**[29:56]** human so people

**[29:57]** are not going to

**[29:58]** be about that

**[29:58]** life.

**[29:59]** Read The Mound

**[30:00]** if you want to

**[30:00]** hear more about

**[30:01]** that.

**[30:02]** How to

**[30:03]** awaken Yig.

**[30:04]** Cost 4 Power

**[30:05]** your controlled

**[30:07]** Gates in an area

**[30:07]** with your great

**[30:08]** old one.

**[30:09]** Pay 4 Power

**[30:10]** and place Yig

**[30:11]** in the area

**[30:12]** containing the

**[30:13]** Gate.

**[30:14]** Yig has 2

**[30:15]** combat

**[30:16]** and the ability

**[30:17]** is snakebite.

**[30:19]** Post battle

**[30:19]** your Cultists

**[30:20]** are now poisonous.

**[30:22]** If any of your

**[30:22]** Cultists are killed

**[30:23]** in battle

**[30:24]** the enemy

**[30:24]** receives 1

**[30:25]** extra kill

**[30:26]** result.

**[30:27]** They only take

**[30:27]** 1 extra kill

**[30:29]** regardless of how

**[30:30]** many Cultists

**[30:30]** die.

**[30:31]** pretty nice.

**[30:34]** Just makes it

**[30:35]** much more dangerous

**[30:35]** to engage in

**[30:36]** battles with

**[30:37]** Yig's controller.

**[30:38]** If they have

**[30:38]** any acolytes

**[30:39]** there you need

**[30:40]** to be taking

**[30:41]** that into account

**[30:42]** and have an

**[30:42]** extra body

**[30:43]** in the fight.

**[30:44]** the Spellbook requirement

**[30:47]** for Yig

**[30:48]** as your action

**[30:49]** for a round

**[30:50]** remove one of

**[30:51]** your controlled

**[30:51]** Gates from the

**[30:52]** map.

**[30:53]** This is a cost

**[30:54]** of course.

**[30:55]** It takes 3 Power

**[30:56]** to build a

**[30:57]** Gate but

**[30:58]** you might also

**[30:59]** be able to use

**[31:00]** this one

**[31:00]** defensively.

**[31:01]** let's suppose

**[31:03]** you stole

**[31:03]** a Gate

**[31:04]** from somebody

**[31:04]** so you're

**[31:06]** currently

**[31:06]** controlling a

**[31:07]** Gate that you

**[31:08]** did not pay

**[31:08]** for.

**[31:09]** Nobody has

**[31:10]** unlimited combat

**[31:10]** so they move

**[31:12]** back in to try

**[31:12]** to take the

**[31:13]** Gate from you.

**[31:14]** You can just

**[31:14]** take this

**[31:15]** Spellbook and

**[31:16]** remove the

**[31:16]** Gate.

**[31:18]** Yes you might

**[31:18]** have an acolyte

**[31:19]** left over still

**[31:20]** that they could

**[31:21]** capture but

**[31:21]** you did deny

**[31:23]** them the main

**[31:24]** valuable thing

**[31:25]** that they wanted

**[31:26]** which was the

**[31:26]** Gate.

**[31:27]** So anyway

**[31:28]** you can use

**[31:29]** that as a

**[31:29]** benefit not

**[31:30]** just a cost.

**[31:32]** And the

**[31:33]** Spellbook that

**[31:33]** works with

**[31:34]** Yig is

**[31:35]** messenger of

**[31:36]** Yig ongoing

**[31:37]** in the doom

**[31:38]** phase each

**[31:39]** other player

**[31:40]** must decide

**[31:41]** if they will

**[31:41]** donate one

**[31:42]** Power from

**[31:43]** their total

**[31:43]** to you.

**[31:44]** For each

**[31:45]** player that

**[31:45]** refuses gain

**[31:46]** one doom.

**[31:48]** Excellent

**[31:49]** Spellbook just

**[31:50]** very not

**[31:51]** super complicated

**[31:52]** but pretty

**[31:52]** crisp and

**[31:53]** good I would

**[31:54]** say.

**[31:55]** In a four

**[31:55]** player game

**[31:56]** likely you're

**[31:57]** getting two

**[31:58]** or three

**[31:58]** Power out

**[31:58]** of this.

**[31:59]** Players are

**[31:59]** not going to

**[32:00]** want to give

**[32:00]** you free

**[32:01]** doom.

**[32:02]** More likely

**[32:03]** they're just

**[32:04]** going to pay

**[32:04]** the Power

**[32:04]** to you.

**[32:06]** I would just

**[32:06]** think about

**[32:07]** this as like

**[32:07]** an extra

**[32:08]** two or three

**[32:08]** Power every

**[32:09]** turn.

**[32:10]** That's just

**[32:11]** Power that

**[32:11]** you can spend

**[32:12]** recruiting your

**[32:13]** acolytes into

**[32:14]** areas that you

**[32:14]** want to be

**[32:15]** fighting in or

**[32:16]** defending in and

**[32:17]** your acolytes are

**[32:18]** going to stay

**[32:18]** poisonous so

**[32:19]** use that extra

**[32:21]** Power to

**[32:21]** recruit and

**[32:23]** stay toxic so

**[32:24]** everyone stays

**[32:25]** away from

**[32:25]** you.

**[32:26]** Which factions

**[32:27]** like this one?

**[32:28]** I think this is

**[32:29]** another nice

**[32:29]** like all-around

**[32:30]** great old one

**[32:31]** that everyone

**[32:32]** can appreciate.

**[32:33]** The doom

**[32:34]** loving factions

**[32:35]** I think are

**[32:35]** going to prefer

**[32:36]** to be on the

**[32:37]** defense with

**[32:38]** this one.

**[32:39]** Yig doesn't

**[32:39]** roll a lot of

**[32:40]** combat dice

**[32:40]** himself but

**[32:41]** your poisonous

**[32:42]** acolytes are

**[32:43]** going to be

**[32:43]** nice when

**[32:44]** people come

**[32:45]** and try to

**[32:46]** like assault

**[32:47]** your secondary

**[32:48]** tertiary Gates.

**[32:50]** They'll probably

**[32:51]** be soaking up

**[32:52]** some extra

**[32:52]** kills in order

**[32:53]** to do that.

**[32:53]** and then any

**[32:55]** faction that's

**[32:56]** able to

**[32:56]** move around

**[32:57]** a big death

**[32:58]** ball like a

**[32:59]** Windwalker or

**[33:00]** a Cthulhu

**[33:00]** they're also

**[33:01]** going to like

**[33:02]** this because

**[33:02]** they'll like to

**[33:03]** kill off their

**[33:05]** inexpensive

**[33:05]** acolytes first

**[33:07]** out of their

**[33:07]** death ball and

**[33:08]** when they do

**[33:08]** if their acolytes

**[33:09]** are poisonous

**[33:10]** they're just

**[33:11]** going to be

**[33:11]** making more

**[33:12]** kills against

**[33:13]** the players

**[33:14]** that they're

**[33:14]** trying to

**[33:14]** fight so

**[33:15]** that's also

**[33:15]** really nice.

**[33:16]** I think that

**[33:20]** does it for

**[33:21]** the independent

**[33:22]** great old

**[33:23]** one pack

**[33:23]** one.

**[33:25]** What do I

**[33:26]** think about

**[33:26]** this one as

**[33:26]** a whole?

**[33:27]** I think it's

**[33:28]** actually a pretty

**[33:28]** strong neutral

**[33:30]** expansion for you

**[33:30]** to pick up if

**[33:31]** I'm being honest.

**[33:33]** I think we

**[33:34]** may have

**[33:34]** discussed this

**[33:35]** in other

**[33:35]** episodes but

**[33:36]** kind of the

**[33:37]** flaw in my

**[33:37]** opinion of the

**[33:38]** neutral monsters

**[33:39]** and terrors is

**[33:41]** that you have to

**[33:41]** pay the doom

**[33:42]** in order to

**[33:43]** recruit them.

**[33:44]** sometimes I

**[33:45]** find myself at

**[33:46]** the end of

**[33:47]** the game at

**[33:47]** 28 doom and

**[33:49]** I'm sad and

**[33:50]** I'm looking at

**[33:50]** the neutral I

**[33:51]** just bought I

**[33:51]** would have won

**[33:52]** if I hadn't

**[33:52]** got it.

**[33:53]** That's not true

**[33:54]** with the great

**[33:55]** old ones.

**[33:55]** They also tend

**[33:56]** to manipulate

**[33:57]** doom and

**[33:58]** Elder Signs which

**[33:59]** I think is a

**[33:59]** fun space to

**[34:00]** play in.

**[34:02]** Notable exception

**[34:02]** Chognar.

**[34:03]** If you've not

**[34:04]** tried it, play

**[34:05]** this one and

**[34:06]** see how you

**[34:07]** like it but I

**[34:08]** don't need to

**[34:09]** play this one

**[34:09]** ever again.

**[34:10]** I really did

**[34:11]** not like what

**[34:11]** it did to the

**[34:12]** game.

**[34:13]** But that being

**[34:13]** said, some of

**[34:14]** these other ones

**[34:14]** are quite fun.

**[34:16]** Abhoth is really

**[34:16]** fun to check

**[34:17]** out.

**[34:18]** Yig, if you're

**[34:19]** trying to just

**[34:19]** introduce somebody

**[34:20]** to the concept

**[34:21]** of neutral

**[34:22]** great old ones,

**[34:22]** I think Yig is

**[34:23]** a great choice.

**[34:25]** And yeah, there's

**[34:25]** just a lot of

**[34:25]** interesting stuff

**[34:26]** going on with

**[34:27]** these.

**[34:27]** Nice, balanced,

**[34:28]** all around.

**[34:29]** Not like one

**[34:30]** faction really

**[34:31]** really preferring

**[34:32]** any of these.

**[34:33]** So definitely

**[34:35]** give them a go.

**[34:36]** I hope you've

**[34:39]** enjoyed this

**[34:40]** episode.
