## Transcript

**[00:00]** Here, somewhat apart from the other buildings, in a sort of square that the jungle had not yet

**[00:06]** wholly usurped, we found a small temple of antique architecture, which gave the impression

**[00:11]** of being far older even than the adjoining edifices. It also differed from these in its

**[00:17]** material, for it was builded of a dark basaltic stone heavily encrusted with lichens that seemed

**[00:22]** of a coeval antiquity. It was square in form, and had no domes nor spires, no facade of pillars,

**[00:29]** and only a few narrow windows high above the ground. Such temples are rare in Hyperborea

**[00:35]** nowadays, but we knew it for a shrine of Sothogwa, one of the elder gods, who receives no longer any

**[00:41]** worship from men, but before whose ash and altars people say, the furtive and ferocious beasts of the

**[00:47]** jungle, the ape, the giant sloth, and the long-toothed tiger, have sometimes been seen to make obeisance,

**[00:52]** and have been heard to howl or whine their inarticulate prayers.

**[00:59]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:17]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[01:23]** Hope you're doing well. Hope you're having a great day wherever you are.

**[01:26]** I had a pretty shitty day yesterday, if I'm being honest, but I'm going to try to have a better

**[01:31]** one today, and what better way to start the day than recording another faction guide for you.

**[01:39]** Today, I'll be talking to you about the Sleeper faction.

**[01:46]** You heard in the intro there a little bit of the story,

**[01:49]** The Tale of Zetamprazeros, created by Clark Ashton Smith, published in 1929.

**[01:58]** If you don't know about Clark Ashton Smith, he was another large contributor to the Weird Tales

**[02:03]** magazine. That's where H.P. Lovecraft published all of his stories for the first time. They were

**[02:08]** friends for a pretty long time before he passed away, I think over 15 years. And like other contemporaries

**[02:14]** of Lovecraft, they used to send each other letters all the time to let each other know about their

**[02:19]** stories or bounce ideas off of each other. You can even read some of those letters out there.

**[02:23]** They are on the internet.

**[02:26]** I think Clark Ashton Smith considered himself a poet before a writer, and yeah, if you look at all of

**[02:32]** his work, there's I think more poetry there, but he did write also quite a bit, and including,

**[02:37]** thankfully for us and for Cthulhu Wars, plenty of weird fiction stories featuring the great old one

**[02:43]** from this faction, among others. So we have Sithogua here and the Sleeper faction to discuss today.

**[02:51]** There's a reason I waited so long to do this particular faction guide. One reason would be,

**[02:57]** I think it's on theme. Many would associate this faction with its trademark great old one ability,

**[03:03]** Lethargy, which lets you do nothing as an action. I'll talk more about that in a bit.

**[03:09]** I think this ability gives the faction kind of a reputation for stomping noobs in Cthulhu Wars.

**[03:17]** I definitely was one of those people who played against this faction for the first time. I'm sure

**[03:22]** I'm not the only one. If you're listening to this and you're very new, I'm sure you've played at least

**[03:26]** one game where you got absolutely crushed by the Sleeper. This faction does a great job of teaching

**[03:32]** the lesson the hard way that we've said many times on this podcast before, that time matters in

**[03:37]** Cthulhu Wars. People having Power left over when others have run out. That matters and is very

**[03:43]** impactful.

**[03:46]** Some might say this faction is like a one-trick pony. I don't think that at all. There's many other tricks

**[03:51]** this faction can employ. Probably I'll miss some of them, but I'm hoping to cover most of them.

**[03:58]** Another reason I waited to do this faction guide is because of its very Powerful and interesting

**[04:04]** interaction with whatever the faction composition is at the table, and that's with its ability Ancient

**[04:10]** Sorcery, which lets you copy unique faction abilities. More discussion coming on that as well,

**[04:17]** but I thought it would be helpful for the listener who has listened to all these episodes, who does have

**[04:22]** all of their faction knowledge at play. I am going to be using the unique abilities pretty interchangeably

**[04:27]** a little bit later, and yeah, that's by design. I'm assuming that you know a little bit about the

**[04:33]** factions at this point, or you've listened to my other episodes. You probably know quite a bit about

**[04:37]** all the unique abilities I'll mention when I discuss Ancient Sorcery in a bit more detail.

**[04:44]** I think this is probably one of the strongest factions in the entire game.

**[04:48]** There's some traps there. Don't worry, I'll discuss those. But yeah, you're going to need to be smart

**[04:53]** and also creative, also improvise a little bit to be successful here, especially against players that

**[04:58]** know what they're doing. This faction, like I said, is going to crush new players all day long, but

**[05:03]** good sleeper players are able to win against the experienced players that know what to look for

**[05:09]** and know how to actually stop this faction, which don't worry, we will discuss. I feel this is another

**[05:16]** like villain faction along with like Chocho Demon Sultan. Obviously I'll be discussing from the

**[05:22]** perspective of playing sleeper mostly, but consider this another know your enemy guide. This is one of

**[05:28]** the strongest factions. You definitely need to know how to play with and against this faction in order

**[05:33]** to be successful in games against the sleeper especially. Sleeper is another unusual faction in

**[05:39]** that I don't really think it falls too far on either side of the spectrum between being like a doom

**[05:44]** loving faction versus a fighty faction. It can definitely do both, but I think I would plot it

**[05:50]** somewhere right in the middle, kind of right around where opener might be.

**[05:56]** And yeah, that's it for my opening thoughts, so I'll move right into the setup, which is very simple.

**[06:01]** On earth, six acolytes and a Gate in an area with a sleeper glyph, and that is around the North America

**[06:06]** area. Not a variable start location, so not much more to say there.

**[06:11]** Moving on to the unique faction ability for sleeper, we have death from below. In the doom phase, place your lowest cost monster from your pool into any area with at least one of your units.

**[06:27]** That's a pretty exciting ability on paper, because you're getting a free unit every turn. Pretty cool.

**[06:32]** But sleeper does have three different monsters, which I'll discuss. They have different costs.

**[06:37]** You have your wizards are the cheapest at one, serpent men at two, and spawns at three.

**[06:42]** You'd really like to be getting a free formless spawn each time you use this ability, but you are going to need to get out other plastic before that can happen.

**[06:53]** Also worth mentioning, when you're placing the units here, it's not into an area where you control a Gate.

**[06:58]** It's just into an area with at least one of your units. So if you happen to have stray Cultists hanging around somewhere, or you need to reinforce where your great old one is,

**[07:09]** you can definitely do that with death from below. You don't need to have a Gate where you end up placing any of these units.

**[07:16]** You can do this, like most doom phase abilities, at any point in the doom phase, so could ritual before or after doing this if you were so inclined.

**[07:24]** And last thing I have to say on death from below for now would be, if you are playing with neutrals, it does work on neutral monsters.

**[07:33]** It just says monster from your pool. It doesn't say faction monster.

**[07:36]** So if you were to buy star vampires or something like that, you could end up placing a star vampire with death from below.

**[07:44]** I'll move on to Spellbook requirements now.

**[07:51]** I'll discuss each of these, but there are four of these that kind of fit a theme with this faction, which is having to pay Power.

**[07:59]** I think this is a really nice drawback for such a strong faction with so many tricks.

**[08:03]** Let's get into them.

**[08:05]** First Spellbook requirement, pay three Power as an action. Each other player gains one Power.

**[08:10]** Kind of nice. I like using this whenever players are on no Power or extremely low Power, so they can't really do anything meaningful with it.

**[08:20]** That's a nice thing.

**[08:21]** Another thing you could do, a thousand forms comes to mind.

**[08:25]** Suppose you're playing a four or five player game.

**[08:28]** Crawling chaos is getting down pretty low in Power.

**[08:31]** Give everybody a Power with this. Tell them, I'm giving you this so that you can pay for a thousand forms.

**[08:35]** And if somebody is reluctant to do so, you can give them a hard time about it because you did actually just give them free Power.

**[08:43]** Next Spellbook requirement, another bit of social engineering.

**[08:47]** Pay three Power as an action. An opponent of your choice gains three Power.

**[08:52]** There's a lot you can do with this. I'd say choose wisely. Be careful.

**[08:56]** This is a really good opportunity to make a deal with somebody.

**[08:59]** So if you try to do this without any strings attached, you're probably just making a mistake because this is a pretty significant amount of Power.

**[09:06]** Remember, three Power is enough to build a Gate.

**[09:09]** You really don't want to just be giving that away willy-nilly, especially to somebody that is not on good terms with you.

**[09:17]** Next Spellbook requirement, we've got pay three Power as an action.

**[09:20]** Each other player loses one Power.

**[09:22]** To be honest, this is one of my favorite Spellbook requirements in all of Cthulhu Wars.

**[09:29]** It can cause some salt for sure, but I really, really like that if used correctly, you can kind of force people out of maybe their habitual builds that only work if they're uninterrupted.

**[09:42]** So what I mean by that is, let's say action phase two as a good example.

**[09:46]** That's when I most like to use this one.

**[09:48]** There's quite a few factions.

**[09:50]** Yellow Sign, Great Cthulhu, Crawling Chaos, others.

**[09:55]** They like to take the entire turn off, basically, to awaken in action phase two.

**[10:00]** Depending on the turn sequence, depending on the factions at the table, you may get the chance to go before Crawling Chaos.

**[10:07]** Suppose Crawling Chaos is down the line.

**[10:09]** You get to go before them and take your first action.

**[10:11]** Take this, and then they lose one Power, and they go from ten Power to nine Power.

**[10:15]** Huge wrench thrown into the Crawling Chaos players' plans, right?

**[10:22]** They might be cross with you, be upset with you, but honestly, to be really good with any faction, or be like a good, well-rounded Cthulhu Wars player in general,

**[10:31]** you really do need to have some sort of a fallback plan for whenever things don't go as expected in action phase two.

**[10:37]** So, watch out for that if you're playing against the sleeper, and yeah, if you're playing with sleeper,

**[10:43]** definitely keep your eyes peeled for opportunities to, like, ruin somebody's plans with this early on in the game.

**[10:51]** Next Spellbook requirement is perform a Ritual of Annihilation.

**[10:55]** This is another ability kind of dependent on the faction composition at the table.

**[11:01]** Obviously, you'd like the cheapest possible ritual, preferably the five-cost ritual,

**[11:07]** but, you know, if you're sitting around with Chocho, maybe Ancients, and Yellow Sign,

**[11:11]** they might start getting expensive pretty quickly.

**[11:14]** Ideally, for this faction, you'd want to have maybe a couple of Gates and your great old one, Sothogma, out,

**[11:20]** so that you can get a couple of Doom and an Elder Sign, but it might still be worth it just to pay the five or six cost while it's cheap,

**[11:28]** not get an Elder Sign, and just get it out of the way so that you can get all your books.

**[11:32]** More on this a little bit later, but you really, really, really don't want to be locked behind an expensive ritual

**[11:38]** in order to earn the last of your books as this faction.

**[11:41]** Very similar to the Crawling Chaos problem, where they have a Spellbook requirement, they need to pay six Power.

**[11:46]** You don't want to wait to have that be your last book, because it might be hard to come by so much Power later on in the game.

**[11:56]** Next Spellbook requirement, roll six or more dice in combat.

**[12:01]** This is pretty easy to do once you get out Sothogma.

**[12:04]** I'd say this is borderline something that's just going to happen to you as playing this faction.

**[12:08]** People are going to come for you at some point to fight you, so I promise you will get this without trying.

**[12:13]** If you can do this on your terms, that's probably ideal.

**[12:18]** You really do want to have your great old one here, because your faction can be a little frail without it.

**[12:23]** It can be tricky to roll that many dice without multiple spawns, which we'll talk more about, and Serpent Men on the field.

**[12:30]** Don't think too hard about this one, but if you don't have to move and battle yourself, that's ideal.

**[12:35]** Last Spellbook requirement for this faction is awaken Sothogma.

**[12:42]** Sothogma is not cheap. It doesn't cost ten, but it does cost eight, which is not insignificant.

**[12:47]** I'll talk more about the awakening requirements for Sothogma, but you're going to need to have a formless spawn.

**[12:53]** You're not just going to need the eight Power, you're also going to need to have a specific monster to awaken your great old one.

**[12:58]** You can kind of see the theme here. This faction needs to pay a lot of Power in order to earn all of its Spellbooks, so let's just do a quick recap.

**[13:08]** Assuming rituals were as cheap as possible at five Power, you still need to pay five plus nine Power for your other Spellbooks.

**[13:16]** That's 14 Power plus eight for Sothogma.

**[13:19]** That's 22 Power, and then assuming you've summoned some amount of monsters because you're going to need a spawn also to awaken Sothogma,

**[13:27]** that's almost 25 Power or more that you will need to have spent in order to earn all your books.

**[13:32]** Keep that in mind as you play this faction.

**[13:37]** I think that Spellbook requirement's out of the way, so I'll move on to the units for the sleeper.

**[13:42]** Starting with their acolytes, sculpted by title four.

**[13:45]** I've got no notes. I love the way they look. I wish more acolytes looked like this.

**[13:51]** Just a generic looking Cultist with a ritualistic, like, wavy dagger coming in for the kill.

**[13:56]** A ritual sacrifice, maybe. Very thematic.

**[14:00]** Not much else to say on the acolytes. There are not Spellbooks that work with them specifically.

**[14:06]** Next, you know, we've got our first monster for this faction.

**[14:09]** We have the Wizards, sculpted by Tim Prowl.

**[14:13]** Love the way these look. I've read quite a bit of the weird fiction Clark Ashton Smith wrote, the Hyperboreous stuff.

**[14:21]** And yeah, I definitely picture something like this, where the Wizards are definitely not a, like, Merlin type.

**[14:27]** They're more of like a, I don't know, you're a wizard.

**[14:31]** Like, you can do something that humans can't do, and there's a reason why.

**[14:35]** This is not really looking very human to me.

**[14:37]** It's got a human head, but it's looking more beast-like.

**[14:40]** It's got wings and a tail, and disturbingly a mouth in the stomach area.

**[14:45]** It looks like it's being pulled open by the arms, and yeah, it's even got some eyes on the side of the mouth.

**[14:51]** It almost looks like the head, the human head of the wizard, is maybe just, like, just there for show, and the real head is, like, in the tummy.

**[15:00]** And yeah, I love the mouth here. I love the little tongue, the teeth.

**[15:03]** Tongue just kind of, like, drooping out of the mouth. Very creepy looking.

**[15:08]** You've got two Wizards in your pool.

**[15:10]** They cost only one Power to summon, and they have a combat of zero.

**[15:13]** This is your cheapest monster. It's only one Power to summon, but very sad zero combat.

**[15:21]** It's still good enough to defend your Gate from other monsters, not unlike the Ghoul from Black Goat.

**[15:27]** More on this in the openings, but you're going to want to get your Wizards out sooner rather than later,

**[15:31]** because it feels pretty bad to get a free Wizard from Death From Below,

**[15:36]** when you know you could be getting maybe a Serpent Man or a Formless Spawn that costs, like, significantly more in Power.

**[15:43]** The main utility for this unit is around the Spellbook Energy Nexus I'll talk a lot more about,

**[15:49]** which lets you take an action just before the dice are being rolled in battle.

**[15:52]** There are a lot of shenanigans with this Spellbook, and I'll talk more about it a little bit later.

**[15:59]** Next unit we have for Sleeper is the Serpent Man, which is sculpted by Tim Prowl.

**[16:04]** Kind of got a similar look to the Cultist, honestly, in the robe,

**[16:08]** but yeah, it's very much a Serpent Man, kind of like what you're picturing in your brain.

**[16:13]** It's got a little bit of a tail sticking out from beneath the robe.

**[16:16]** Humanoid hands, but very much a Serpent's head, and hands are clasped, maybe in prayer.

**[16:23]** Kind of devious, looking like it's scheming something to do.

**[16:27]** Got three Serpent Man in the pool.

**[16:29]** They cost two to summon, and they have a combat of one.

**[16:33]** This unit's kind of forgettable in combat, but still very important for this faction.

**[16:38]** The main attraction here is the Spellbook Ancient Sorcery I'll talk more about,

**[16:43]** which lets you copy unique abilities of other factions by placing Serpent Men on other faction cards.

**[16:50]** More on this when I talk about Ancient Sorcery,

**[16:53]** but Serpent Men also have a tendency to show up at any areas on the map, pretty much.

**[16:59]** That can be a nice way to attack remote areas or defend stolen Gates.

**[17:03]** Moving on to our last monster, I've got to read a little bit more of Clark Ashton Smith.

**[17:12]** What unimaginable horror of protoplasmic life,

**[17:18]** what loathly spawn of the primordial slime had come forth to confront us,

**[17:22]** we did not pause to consider or conjecture.

**[17:25]** Monstrosity was too awful to permit of even a brief contemplation.

**[17:29]** Also, its intentions were too plainly hostile,

**[17:32]** and it gave evidence of anthropomorphic inclinations.

**[17:36]** For it slithered toward us with an unbelievable speed and celerity of motion,

**[17:40]** opening as it came a toothless mouth of amazing capacity.

**[17:44]** As it gaped upon us, revealing a tongue that uncoiled like a long serpent,

**[17:48]** its jaws widened with the same extreme elasticity that accompanied all its other movements.

**[17:56]** And of course, I'm talking about the Formless Spawn,

**[18:00]** sculpted by Neil McKenzie.

**[18:02]** Very cool looking.

**[18:04]** It's just a blob of tentacles with a big, disgusting mouth up top.

**[18:10]** Very unpleasant looking.

**[18:12]** Maybe even a second mouth here below.

**[18:14]** Kind of a bubbling mess.

**[18:16]** It feels like it would be at home in the opener faction as well,

**[18:19]** but it does belong to the sleeper,

**[18:22]** and this is kind of like the royal guard for Sothogwa, so to speak.

**[18:26]** You've got four of these in your pool.

**[18:30]** They cost three Power to summon,

**[18:32]** and the combat is equal to the total count of the number of spawns you have plus Sothogwa.

**[18:39]** So for example, spawns would have four combat if you controlled Sothogwa,

**[18:44]** and also had three other spawns in play.

**[18:47]** These are your most expensive units at three cost.

**[18:50]** Ideally, at some point you can start getting them for free every Doom phase with Death From Below,

**[18:54]** but you might have to summon one here and there

**[18:56]** in order to get out your great old one a little bit earlier than normal.

**[19:02]** They can also kind of hit pretty hard if you get the full collection together

**[19:05]** of four spawns plus Sothogwa.

**[19:08]** They'll each be rolling five dice at that point,

**[19:11]** so all the spawns together are rolling 20 dice plus whatever Sothogwa is rolling.

**[19:16]** This faction actually can brawl with the other fighty factions

**[19:19]** if allowed to get all their spawns in play.

**[19:24]** And yeah, that's enough on the spawn,

**[19:26]** so I will move on to the last unit for the sleeper, their great old one.

**[19:31]** I'd never seen an image of Sothogwa before,

**[19:35]** but I recognized him without difficulty from the descriptions I'd heard.

**[19:39]** He was very squat and pot-bellied.

**[19:41]** His head was more like that of a monstrous toad than a deity,

**[19:44]** and his whole body was covered with an imitation of short fur,

**[19:48]** giving somehow a vague suggestion of both the bat and the sloth.

**[19:52]** His sleepy lids were half-lowered over his globular eyes,

**[19:56]** and the tip of a queer tongue issued from his fat mouth.

**[19:58]** And yes, the last unit we have, Sothogwa here,

**[20:04]** sculpted by Jason Wiebe.

**[20:06]** Hopefully I'm saying their last name right.

**[20:09]** I feel like Jason read that exact passage and sculpted what he saw,

**[20:12]** and we have something here that looks kind of toad-like,

**[20:16]** does have some ape-like things going on,

**[20:20]** kind of looks like some rocky growths on its arms,

**[20:23]** definitely some fur on the back,

**[20:26]** very large, gaping mouth and tongue,

**[20:30]** a very gross-looking belly area,

**[20:34]** two sets of nipples, in case you were wondering.

**[20:38]** I'd say this is another pretty iconic-looking great old one,

**[20:41]** something that I think of when I think of the great old ones in this game,

**[20:44]** Sothogwa comes to mind.

**[20:45]** Let's go over the awakening requirements.

**[20:49]** You're going to need to have a formless spawn on the map,

**[20:52]** which remember those costs three to summon,

**[20:54]** and you're going to need to pay eight Power,

**[20:56]** and you'll place Sothogwa in the area with the formless spawn.

**[21:00]** So notice there you actually don't need a Gate to awaken this great old one,

**[21:03]** you do just need to have a formless spawn in play.

**[21:07]** Combat for this great old one equals the opponent that you're battling,

**[21:11]** their current Power or two, whichever is greater.

**[21:16]** The more Power your opponent has, the harder this thing hits.

**[21:19]** If your opponent has ten Power,

**[21:21]** Sothogwa is going to easily earn that six dice spellwork requirement by itself,

**[21:25]** which is pretty nice.

**[21:27]** But when someone's completely spent,

**[21:28]** your great old one's only rolling two dice.

**[21:31]** So remember that when you're picking fights with people.

**[21:35]** Last thing on the awakening,

**[21:37]** be very careful of your spawn count.

**[21:39]** If you don't have any formless spawns,

**[21:41]** you straight up cannot awaken the toad.

**[21:43]** So savvy players are going to be looking for that.

**[21:45]** Maybe they're going to be hunting for spawns.

**[21:47]** You're going to need to watch out for players targeting you

**[21:50]** before you awaken or after Sothogwa has been killed at some point.

**[21:55]** And the unique ability of this great old one is lethargy.

**[22:00]** It's a zero cost action.

**[22:01]** If Sothogwa is in play,

**[22:03]** do nothing.

**[22:04]** This counts as an action.

**[22:07]** So yeah, I mentioned this one in the intro.

**[22:09]** It's a signature ability for this faction.

**[22:12]** What most people think of when they think of this faction.

**[22:15]** Nobody bothers you.

**[22:17]** You can freely just spend zero Power each time it comes around to your turn

**[22:20]** and just wait out the other players

**[22:22]** and really only do things when it actually matters.

**[22:25]** Ideally when they're all spent out of Power

**[22:27]** and you can go do whatever you want.

**[22:30]** In games against newer players,

**[22:31]** I think you can easily win by just spamming this ability over and over again

**[22:35]** and just waiting for everyone to be out

**[22:37]** and then go and claim some Gates.

**[22:40]** However, once you get into games with intermediate, advanced players, good players,

**[22:46]** they're not going to let you do this.

**[22:47]** They're going to come for you

**[22:48]** and not just let you sit there until everybody's out of Power.

**[22:51]** My suggestion would be try to balance doing something and doing nothing

**[22:57]** if you really want to be successful with this faction.

**[22:59]** You have a lot of tricks to take advantage of people when they do move against you.

**[23:03]** So more on that a bit later in the openings and playing sleeper.

**[23:07]** But yeah, lethargy, very, very strong against new players.

**[23:11]** Still very, very strong against the best Cthulhu or worst players out there

**[23:14]** when used correctly.

**[23:15]** And that's it for the sleeper unit.

**[23:20]** So I will go on to discuss the Spellbooks.

**[23:24]** Starting with Burrow.

**[23:25]** It's an ongoing ability after a move action

**[23:27]** in which you spend two or more Power moving units,

**[23:30]** regain one Power.

**[23:32]** This is a really nice bread and butter Spellbook.

**[23:35]** I always take this as one of my first Spellbooks.

**[23:38]** Like most factions, if you think you can be clever and not take this first, great.

**[23:42]** But I've seen a lot of very awkward games and participated in them.

**[23:46]** Playing as this faction, you really do want to get this as one of your first books

**[23:49]** every single time.

**[23:50]** This is definitely one of the best movement abilities in the game.

**[23:54]** Other factions are going to be jealous of how cheap it is for you to move around.

**[23:58]** And that's not even considering what else can be accomplished

**[24:00]** when combining Burrow with some of the other unique faction abilities

**[24:05]** you might be able to steal using ancient sorcery.

**[24:07]** General piece of advice on Burrow is unless you have exactly one Power to spend,

**[24:14]** try to always be moving a second unit

**[24:16]** just so you're always taking advantage of the Power that Burrow provides you if possible.

**[24:21]** So if you're going to go build a Gate,

**[24:23]** might as well move two acolytes or an acolyte and a wizard

**[24:26]** and gain a Power back, that kind of thing.

**[24:31]** Next Spellbook we have to discuss is Ancient Sorcery.

**[24:34]** It's a one cost action.

**[24:37]** Remove a Serpent Man from the map and place it on an enemy's faction card.

**[24:42]** For the reindeer of that turn, you have access to that enemy faction's unique ability.

**[24:46]** During the Doom phase, gain one Power

**[24:48]** and the Serpent Man returns to the map in an area of your choice.

**[24:53]** If the unique ability mentions a faction's great old one,

**[24:56]** it's considered to also include Sothogwa.

**[24:58]** So I think this is easily one of the coolest Spellbooks in the whole game,

**[25:05]** being able to copy other abilities.

**[25:07]** I think it kind of makes designing factions a bit challenging

**[25:10]** because you need to be able to figure out if they work or break Ancient Sorcery.

**[25:14]** So shout out to people who are making custom factions on the internet.

**[25:18]** Ancient Sorcery, always something that you need to be mindful of when you do this.

**[25:22]** This is an amazing ability.

**[25:25]** It scales with the player count and can really get different outcomes

**[25:29]** depending on the faction composition like I mentioned in the intro.

**[25:33]** You're going to want to get creative and figure out

**[25:35]** which abilities you want to copy and use or even just threaten to use.

**[25:40]** I know some people are wondering, like,

**[25:42]** would you rate every unique faction ability?

**[25:45]** Yeah, I'm definitely going to.

**[25:47]** Here is my tier list right now.

**[25:48]** Maybe there's some hot takes in here, but I could justify each one of these.

**[25:53]** So I'm going to start from the top in the S tier.

**[25:56]** We have Flight and we have Hibernate.

**[25:59]** Flight is just the best movement ability in the game.

**[26:02]** And yeah, combined with Burrow just makes this faction absolutely terrifying.

**[26:07]** You heard it here first.

**[26:07]** Flight is absolutely the best ability to copy with Ancient Sorcery.

**[26:11]** It's not close.

**[26:13]** But another ability in the S tier is Hibernate.

**[26:16]** And why is this one so good?

**[26:19]** Well, if you've played Windwalker, you know how strong Hibernate is.

**[26:22]** And this faction needs to spend quite a bit more Power than Windwalker

**[26:25]** to earn all their Spellbooks.

**[26:26]** So any opportunity you have to do nothing until you decide to Hibernate

**[26:31]** and then even, like, net some Power on top of it

**[26:33]** because of how Hibernate works, that's really, really good.

**[26:37]** It's going to help you pay for some of these expensive costs.

**[26:40]** Maybe the Ritual is getting up there in cost and it's like 8 Power.

**[26:43]** Hibernate is going to make that feel not nearly as painful.

**[26:46]** Cool.

**[26:48]** In the A tier, we've got Beyond 1, Sycophancy, Dematerialization, Immortal, and Psychosis.

**[26:55]** Beyond 1, a bit similar to Flight, gives you tons of mobility.

**[27:00]** If you are sitting at a Gate, you can just move it around.

**[27:02]** Spawns can use Beyond 1 because they cost 3.

**[27:05]** That's really nice.

**[27:08]** Sycophancy is just kind of mean because, obviously,

**[27:11]** Chocho is going to be in the game and they're going to have it themselves.

**[27:13]** So if you copy Sycophancy, anytime anybody rituals that's not you and Chocho,

**[27:18]** they're going to need to, yikes, get to less doom or start giving away doom to somebody.

**[27:24]** Hopefully it's you.

**[27:25]** They should know better than to give it away to Chocho.

**[27:29]** Dematerialization from Ancients, pretty nice.

**[27:32]** Not really an active movement ability, but you tend to clump up in a ball as this faction.

**[27:36]** So it's nice to be able to, like, transport your huge ball of sleeper units in the doom phase somewhere else without having to spend Power.

**[27:45]** Immortal, I'm going to get some pushback for not having this in the S tier, but I'll say more on this later.

**[27:50]** You're totally wrong if you think this is S tier.

**[27:53]** Immortal is just nice if Sathagwa does get killed and you don't need to spend 8 Power to awaken again.

**[27:59]** Makes it half as expensive, so 4 Power to awaken in this case.

**[28:03]** If you're playing this faction well, the trick is you just don't get Sathagwa ever killed,

**[28:09]** therefore you don't really need to use Immortal so much.

**[28:12]** That's why it's in the A tier.

**[28:15]** Psychosis, kind of borderline here, but you do tend to get your acolytes captured as this faction,

**[28:20]** so some way to, like, deploy them out again for free, not having to spend Power on them,

**[28:25]** and then combined with Burrow, kind of getting them into the position without having to really spend very much is pretty nice.

**[28:33]** In the B tier, I've got Feast from Yellow Sign and Fertility Cult from Black Goat.

**[28:39]** Feast, kind of unimpressive, but, you know, if Yellow Sign is walking through your areas

**[28:44]** and has laid down a couple of desecration tokens, maybe you can get a couple of Power off it. Cool.

**[28:48]** Fertility Cult, very much not useful, I would say.

**[28:53]** You are getting free units from Death from Below, so I don't really know why you would want to spend, like,

**[28:59]** 5 or 6 Power getting some Serpent Men and Spawns, but maybe you could do it in an emergency.

**[29:04]** That could be nice.

**[29:04]** And I'm going to go now into the F tier.

**[29:09]** We've got Eternal Servitude from the Invasion faction, which I'm confused about what that even does.

**[29:14]** More on that in another episode.

**[29:17]** And then we've got Lunacy from the Cats, which does literally nothing with this faction,

**[29:20]** because Tisagwa doesn't have any cats on the payroll.

**[29:26]** Anyway, that's the tier list done.

**[29:28]** Back to talking about this ability in general.

**[29:30]** So even putting aside the ability to copy unique faction abilities, that's the main attraction.

**[29:37]** Suppose you have, like, a really bad combo of Yellow Sign, Black Goat, and Bubasus in the game.

**[29:42]** This ability still lets you gain some Power as you place the Serpent Men back onto the map.

**[29:47]** So that's kind of a nice way to store up Power for use to pay for your Spellbook requirements.

**[29:54]** So, you know, potentially 3 extra Power for you, since you have 3 Serpent Men in the pool.

**[30:00]** The other thing to mention is, you're able to redeploy the Serpent Men back into any area on the map.

**[30:07]** That's pretty nice, letting you maybe attack Gates that don't have monsters on them early on,

**[30:13]** or maybe defend some Gates that you stole from other people at the end of the last action phase.

**[30:18]** Now I've got a quick PSA, esoteric rules PSA.

**[30:25]** This is not the normal Doom Phase timing, the placing of the Serpent Men back onto the map.

**[30:30]** Unlike all other books in the game, this is at the end of the Doom Phase specifically.

**[30:35]** I didn't read it like that on my Spellbook, but I have confirmed.

**[30:39]** This is not during the Doom Phase.

**[30:41]** This is at the tail end of the Doom Phase.

**[30:44]** So what that means, the implication here, is you cannot first Ancient Sorcery a Serpent Men down into any area,

**[30:51]** and then do Death From Below to place a Formless Spawn into that same area.

**[30:56]** The Death From Below has to happen first, then the Ancient Sorcery can happen.

**[31:02]** This is in the Onslaught 4 printing of Sleeper.

**[31:05]** I have confirmed via scans, via people on Discord, that this book is probably slightly off in every other printing,

**[31:12]** so huge shoutout to QuickDraw2197 on Discord.

**[31:17]** Thank you for confirming this for me.

**[31:19]** Seriously, does it work that way?

**[31:21]** Yes, it does.

**[31:22]** The fun fact here is the end of the Doom Phase timing of this ability was key to the design of what became the crossover invasion faction.

**[31:32]** We'll cover that one at some point.

**[31:35]** I think that's all on Ancient Sorcery.

**[31:38]** I could do a whole episode on it, but very strong, very tricksy, get creative with how you use this,

**[31:44]** and yeah, obviously, if you're playing in a very large game, that's great for you,

**[31:48]** because there are even more abilities for you to copy.

**[31:53]** Moving on to another Spellbook, we've got Capture Monster.

**[31:56]** It's a one-cost action.

**[31:58]** Sothogwa can capture enemy monsters in the same manner Cultists are captured.

**[32:03]** They're sacrificed for one Power in the next Gather Power phase.

**[32:06]** So this is another nice Spellbook.

**[32:09]** This faction really doesn't have any bad Spellbooks, in my opinion.

**[32:12]** Newer players might be tempted to take this early on.

**[32:15]** It's pretty attractive, the idea of capturing monsters out of the way,

**[32:18]** but in my opinion, this is one of the weaker Spellbooks that this faction has.

**[32:23]** But having said that, it's extremely effective against certain units.

**[32:26]** So one example I would call out is Sleeper is a huge threat to the cats.

**[32:31]** Great foil against Bubastus, because it can just eat the cats at your Gates,

**[32:36]** and that is very bad for them.

**[32:39]** Also likes to eat other endangered units, like maybe spawns of Yogsothoth,

**[32:45]** Demon Sultan Larvae, or Dark Young holding down Gates for Black Goat are also sad if they get eaten.

**[32:51]** Not too much else to say there, so I'll move on to another Spellbook.

**[32:58]** We've got Cursed Slumber. It's a one-cost action.

**[33:01]** Remove your controlled Gate and its Cultists from the map, and place it on your faction card.

**[33:06]** This Gate and Cultists still provide Power and count normally for doom points,

**[33:10]** but are immune to enemy actions.

**[33:12]** As a one-cost action, you can return the Gate and Cultists to any area lacking a Gate.

**[33:17]** You may only have one Gate on your faction card at a time.

**[33:22]** Very useful ability.

**[33:24]** When you play with good players, they're going to really want to limit your Gate count,

**[33:28]** and yeah, having a Gate that's just hanging out on your faction card that's untouchable,

**[33:32]** nice way to retain a source of Power and doom,

**[33:35]** even if you don't really have more than one Gate out on the map.

**[33:39]** I see a lot of people use this ability just one time to put a Gate onto their faction card,

**[33:43]** and they never take it off.

**[33:44]** That's all well and good, but there's a lot more flexibility here.

**[33:49]** I don't see people use very often.

**[33:51]** For example, don't put your Gate on your faction card.

**[33:54]** You can use this book kind of defensively.

**[33:56]** If somebody moves over to your under-defended Gate,

**[33:59]** before they have a chance to capture you,

**[34:01]** you have an action, you just place it on your faction card.

**[34:03]** Sorry, they just wasted their Power moving over there.

**[34:07]** One thing I really like to do also is,

**[34:10]** towards the end of the action phase,

**[34:11]** maybe you have used lethargy a bunch of times,

**[34:14]** I like to redeploy my Gate back onto the map

**[34:17]** in some remote, isolated area

**[34:19]** before I become the first player.

**[34:22]** That way, if I steal some other Gates,

**[34:24]** maybe I steal one or two Gates, let's say,

**[34:26]** in the next action phase,

**[34:28]** assuming maybe I go first or second or something,

**[34:30]** you can hide your stolen Gates when someone comes forward,

**[34:33]** or maybe you stole a Gate right under the nose of another great old one,

**[34:36]** and they're right there ready to capture when the action phase rolls around,

**[34:40]** you can then hide that Gate on your faction card

**[34:42]** and get it out of the way and back to safety.

**[34:45]** So, underutilized tactic here is

**[34:48]** spend some Power taking Gates off and on your faction card,

**[34:51]** kind of like slowly rearranging the Gates.

**[34:54]** You can kind of do a bit of a beyond one impression

**[34:56]** if you're using this more frequently.

**[34:58]** That's not something I see used often,

**[35:01]** but is something that you have in your toolkit,

**[35:03]** so remember it.

**[35:03]** Last point on this book would be

**[35:07]** use this to be mean to players

**[35:09]** that care about Gates in certain areas.

**[35:12]** So, the main one that comes to mind is Cthulhu.

**[35:15]** If you ever have the opportunity to, like,

**[35:17]** claim the South Pacific Gate

**[35:19]** and then stick it on your faction card,

**[35:21]** that's so annoying for great Cthulhu

**[35:22]** because they now need a Gate there

**[35:25]** in order to awaken again.

**[35:26]** So, if you manage to curse slumber theirs,

**[35:28]** they'll be very sad.

**[35:31]** Other, like, less likely examples would be,

**[35:33]** like, Chocho's starting Gate,

**[35:35]** the Windwalker Gates that need to be

**[35:37]** in certain areas to awaken,

**[35:38]** things like that.

**[35:39]** But yeah, the main one is Cthulhu,

**[35:41]** and that is one of your enemies,

**[35:43]** the faction that's going to try to bully you.

**[35:45]** So, if you can be mean to them, great.

**[35:49]** Next Spellbook, we have Demand Sacrifice.

**[35:52]** It's a pre-battle.

**[35:53]** If Sothog was in play,

**[35:54]** your enemy chooses one of the following options

**[35:57]** before a battle with you.

**[35:59]** You gain an Elder Sign,

**[36:00]** or all their kill results count as pains

**[36:02]** on your units in this battle.

**[36:05]** People really hate playing against this one,

**[36:07]** honestly.

**[36:08]** They probably will pain you most of the time

**[36:11]** whenever you're in a big ball,

**[36:13]** and they're only going to give you

**[36:14]** an Elder Sign when they're going for the kill

**[36:17]** and trying to whittle you down

**[36:18]** into, like, a smaller group of

**[36:20]** maybe just Sothogwa and, like,

**[36:22]** another unit or two.

**[36:23]** You can manage to earn, like,

**[36:26]** even two Elder Signs from this,

**[36:28]** two or three.

**[36:29]** It's probably paid for itself,

**[36:30]** and you've done a great job.

**[36:31]** Hopefully, Sothogwa is alive at the end of it.

**[36:35]** Not too much else to say there.

**[36:36]** This is a pretty straightforward one,

**[36:38]** pretty annoying one for your opponents,

**[36:39]** giving them a decision before every battle.

**[36:42]** Definitely don't forget about this one.

**[36:44]** Really bug people before they physically

**[36:46]** roll the dice in front of you.

**[36:47]** I've seen that happen before,

**[36:48]** where someone was like,

**[36:50]** oh, Demand Sacrifice,

**[36:51]** like, after the dice are rolled.

**[36:52]** Just say it before

**[36:53]** can really make a difference

**[36:55]** when this faction gets into, like,

**[36:56]** the 20-plus Doom range.

**[37:01]** And the last Spellbook for this faction

**[37:03]** is Energy Nexus.

**[37:05]** It's an ongoing ability.

**[37:07]** Just before a battle occurs

**[37:08]** in an area containing a wizard,

**[37:10]** you may take one action

**[37:11]** that originates in the area

**[37:13]** for its normal Power cost.

**[37:14]** When you finish that action,

**[37:16]** the battle proceeds,

**[37:17]** starting with pre-battle Spellbooks

**[37:18]** and abilities.

**[37:19]** This is a Spellbook

**[37:22]** I see the newer Sleeve-er players

**[37:24]** not really utilizing,

**[37:26]** but make no mistake,

**[37:27]** this is your best Spellbook,

**[37:28]** and I will be happy to explain why.

**[37:31]** There's a lot of possibilities with this book,

**[37:33]** a lot of actions that you could take

**[37:35]** before the battle in that area,

**[37:36]** but really the best one involves

**[37:38]** moving Sothogwa and a wizard

**[37:40]** together out of the battle area.

**[37:43]** If anybody tries to battle you,

**[37:45]** you can just burrow move out of the way,

**[37:47]** you've only spent one Power,

**[37:49]** and assuming those were the only units

**[37:51]** that you had in the area,

**[37:52]** the battle just doesn't happen,

**[37:54]** and your opponent basically

**[37:55]** just wasted Power,

**[37:56]** maybe moving in and battling you,

**[37:58]** because you just moved away.

**[38:01]** Combine this with Lethargy,

**[38:02]** you can kind of just sit around

**[38:03]** until somebody comes to fight you,

**[38:05]** and you just move out of the way.

**[38:06]** More on this a bit later.

**[38:07]** My opinion,

**[38:09]** this book is even stronger

**[38:11]** than Demand Sacrifice,

**[38:12]** because the opponent doesn't even

**[38:14]** get a chance to battle you

**[38:15]** and pain you anywhere.

**[38:17]** If Crawling Chaos is in the game,

**[38:19]** you really don't want to get battled

**[38:20]** and madness pained,

**[38:21]** that's a quick way to lose Sothogwa.

**[38:24]** If you've got Energy Nexus out,

**[38:26]** you can pretty safely avoid

**[38:27]** problematic battles for you,

**[38:29]** and just prevent bad things

**[38:31]** from happening to your great old one.

**[38:34]** I'll say a lot more on this book

**[38:35]** as I move into playing Sleeper,

**[38:37]** but yeah,

**[38:38]** done with Spellbooks,

**[38:39]** I'll move on to openings

**[38:40]** for this faction.

**[38:43]** In Action Phase 1,

**[38:44]** you've got a couple different things

**[38:46]** that you can do.

**[38:47]** First thing you could do is,

**[38:49]** I'll call this one,

**[38:50]** like summoning all the things.

**[38:52]** You could just not build a Gate,

**[38:53]** and you have enough Power

**[38:54]** to summon three Serpent Men

**[38:56]** and two Wizards.

**[38:57]** That would be all of your Power.

**[39:00]** Some of the pros here is,

**[39:02]** it sets you up for Action Phase 2,

**[39:04]** Death From Below.

**[39:05]** You will get a Formless Spawn,

**[39:06]** because you will have had

**[39:08]** all of your other plastic out on the board.

**[39:10]** You also have exactly enough Power,

**[39:12]** eight Power,

**[39:13]** to awaken Sothogwa on Action Phase 2.

**[39:16]** This is very safe.

**[39:18]** Being a fast Sothogwa is good.

**[39:20]** Pawns here,

**[39:21]** you're getting a little bit less Doom,

**[39:23]** and you're basically taking two turns

**[39:24]** doing nothing,

**[39:25]** not interacting with the other players,

**[39:27]** but maybe that's not a bad thing,

**[39:28]** depending on which factions are at the table.

**[39:30]** If there's really good players at the table,

**[39:33]** you might be best off just doing this,

**[39:35]** and not bothering anybody too early,

**[39:37]** and not being bothered too early.

**[39:41]** Another thing you could do in Action Phase 1

**[39:43]** is move,

**[39:45]** build a Gate,

**[39:46]** summon a wizard,

**[39:47]** and then pay three Power

**[39:48]** for one of your Spellbook requirements.

**[39:51]** Which one of those to choose?

**[39:52]** I don't know.

**[39:53]** Be mean and use minus one Power,

**[39:54]** maybe,

**[39:55]** depending on what factions are around.

**[39:57]** Plus one Power to everyone is kind of nice.

**[40:00]** They won't be able to do much with it

**[40:01]** in the first Action Phase.

**[40:03]** Plus three Power to one player

**[40:05]** is kind of risky,

**[40:06]** but if your intention is to make somebody else

**[40:08]** into a threat,

**[40:09]** maybe allowing them to get two Gates

**[40:12]** in the first Action Phase,

**[40:13]** that's definitely a thing that you can do.

**[40:15]** People might be complaining at you

**[40:17]** right off the bat,

**[40:18]** but that's kind of what you want to do

**[40:19]** with this faction,

**[40:20]** is deflect attention away from yourself.

**[40:23]** That's definitely a thing.

**[40:26]** What else could you do?

**[40:27]** Move,

**[40:28]** build a Gate,

**[40:29]** summon a wizard,

**[40:29]** and then summon a formless spawn.

**[40:32]** Probably the strongest opening

**[40:33]** for this faction,

**[40:34]** but also the greediest.

**[40:36]** This one's going to let you have

**[40:38]** 10 Power

**[40:39]** and the spawn that you need

**[40:40]** to get Sothogwa in Action Phase 2.

**[40:44]** Main con is

**[40:46]** your death from below ability

**[40:47]** is going to be pretty anemic.

**[40:49]** You will be getting a free wizard,

**[40:51]** and then you'll have all of your

**[40:52]** three serpent men

**[40:53]** still in the tank

**[40:54]** to death from below

**[40:55]** if you can't summon them sooner.

**[40:56]** And building a second Gate

**[40:59]** this early

**[41:00]** definitely makes you a target,

**[41:02]** and another con would be

**[41:03]** you didn't pay

**[41:04]** for one of your Spellbook requirements,

**[41:06]** which is something

**[41:07]** that you're going to need to do

**[41:07]** during the game.

**[41:10]** I do recommend this one.

**[41:11]** If you're playing against new players,

**[41:12]** definitely go for this.

**[41:14]** If people don't know

**[41:14]** to come after

**[41:15]** one of your Gates,

**[41:17]** definitely just go for this.

**[41:18]** It's probably the strongest opening.

**[41:19]** And then from there,

**[41:22]** we've got a couple things

**[41:23]** I just kind of don't recommend doing.

**[41:25]** You could, for example,

**[41:27]** pay six Power

**[41:28]** and, you know,

**[41:29]** take a couple of your Spellbook requirements

**[41:31]** and summon a couple of wizards.

**[41:32]** That's definitely a thing

**[41:33]** that you can do,

**[41:34]** but I don't think

**[41:34]** it's particularly useful.

**[41:36]** Not really setting you up

**[41:37]** for success

**[41:38]** in the next action phase.

**[41:39]** And then the other one

**[41:40]** to discuss is like

**[41:41]** going for three Gates,

**[41:43]** building two Gates

**[41:44]** in the first action phase.

**[41:45]** Just not really a thing

**[41:46]** you should ever do.

**[41:48]** You really have no way

**[41:49]** to defend this

**[41:50]** and it's going to attract

**[41:51]** way too much attention to you,

**[41:52]** which is already a problem

**[41:53]** that you're going to have

**[41:54]** throughout the game.

**[41:56]** Three Gates is just not the way.

**[41:58]** So don't even try.

**[42:01]** Okay, so you did one of those

**[42:02]** in action phase one

**[42:03]** and now you're in action phase two.

**[42:05]** The main decision is like,

**[42:06]** are you going to get Sithagua

**[42:07]** or aren't you?

**[42:08]** Do you have eight Power

**[42:09]** or ten Power?

**[42:11]** You're going to need to spawn

**[42:12]** obviously to awaken.

**[42:14]** So if yes,

**[42:15]** and you do awaken,

**[42:16]** you're probably mostly spent.

**[42:17]** You might have two Power

**[42:18]** left over if you do

**[42:19]** like summon a serpent man

**[42:21]** or something.

**[42:23]** If you're not getting the toad,

**[42:25]** yeah, I recommend taking

**[42:26]** one of your spell book requirements.

**[42:27]** Like I mentioned earlier,

**[42:29]** great time to hit everybody

**[42:30]** with the minus one Power,

**[42:32]** especially if it fucks with

**[42:33]** like, you know,

**[42:34]** Crawling Chaos,

**[42:35]** Great Cthulhu,

**[42:35]** Yellow Sign,

**[42:36]** something like that.

**[42:38]** If you're going to take

**[42:38]** a spell book,

**[42:39]** probably Burrow

**[42:40]** is what I would recommend.

**[42:42]** It's just going to make it easier

**[42:43]** for you to hopefully build

**[42:45]** another Gate or two

**[42:46]** and be on maybe three

**[42:48]** or four Gates

**[42:48]** for the next round.

**[42:51]** In action phase three,

**[42:53]** obviously,

**[42:54]** get Sithagua out

**[42:54]** if you haven't done so already.

**[42:56]** And I would be trying to pay

**[42:58]** for at least

**[42:59]** one of those four

**[43:00]** spell book requirements,

**[43:01]** if not more.

**[43:02]** definitely like the ritual,

**[43:04]** if they're getting expensive,

**[43:06]** now's the time.

**[43:08]** From there,

**[43:09]** just try to keep

**[43:09]** Sithagua safe,

**[43:10]** try to maintain

**[43:11]** your Gate count,

**[43:12]** and you should be on your way

**[43:13]** to winning the game.

**[43:15]** That's all for openings,

**[43:17]** and I'll just kind of

**[43:17]** transition into

**[43:18]** playing Sleeper,

**[43:20]** generally.

**[43:23]** There's a couple of rules

**[43:24]** that I have

**[43:24]** for playing this faction,

**[43:26]** and I'll just

**[43:27]** go over each of them.

**[43:28]** First rule,

**[43:29]** don't ever let

**[43:30]** Sithagua get killed.

**[43:31]** You're super frail

**[43:32]** without it,

**[43:33]** and you will lose

**[43:34]** if this great old one

**[43:36]** gets killed

**[43:36]** multiple times.

**[43:38]** You have some tools

**[43:39]** to avoid this.

**[43:41]** So,

**[43:41]** first one be

**[43:42]** stalling with lethargy,

**[43:43]** obviously.

**[43:45]** That's going to work

**[43:45]** really well against

**[43:46]** inexperienced players,

**[43:47]** but not against

**[43:48]** veteran players.

**[43:51]** You've got

**[43:51]** demand sacrifice.

**[43:53]** That's going to work

**[43:53]** pretty well against

**[43:54]** players who don't

**[43:55]** already understand

**[43:56]** this faction.

**[43:57]** They might always

**[43:58]** pain you away.

**[43:58]** They might give you

**[43:59]** some Elder Signs

**[44:00]** that you didn't

**[44:00]** really deserve.

**[44:02]** Savvy players,

**[44:03]** they're only going

**[44:04]** to give you the Elder Signs

**[44:05]** if they think

**[44:05]** they have a good shot

**[44:06]** at killing Sithagua.

**[44:07]** So,

**[44:08]** demand sacrifice

**[44:08]** is kind of

**[44:09]** medium to nice tool

**[44:11]** for avoiding

**[44:12]** getting killed.

**[44:14]** Actual best tool

**[44:15]** for avoiding

**[44:16]** getting killed

**[44:17]** is energy nexus.

**[44:19]** Like I mentioned earlier,

**[44:20]** moving out of the

**[44:21]** battle area,

**[44:22]** you're just not even

**[44:23]** giving anyone

**[44:23]** the opportunity

**[44:24]** to roll dice

**[44:25]** against you.

**[44:25]** You're just

**[44:26]** moving away.

**[44:28]** Even if someone

**[44:28]** has unlimited combat

**[44:29]** and you don't,

**[44:30]** they'll still need

**[44:31]** to pay for another

**[44:32]** move and another

**[44:33]** battle in order

**[44:34]** to pursue you

**[44:35]** further,

**[44:35]** while all you need

**[44:36]** to do is spend

**[44:37]** like a net of one

**[44:39]** Power with Burrow

**[44:40]** and move out of the way.

**[44:41]** That's just a losing

**[44:42]** proposition for the

**[44:44]** attacker.

**[44:45]** They're going to run

**[44:45]** out of Power faster

**[44:46]** than you,

**[44:46]** assuming you had like

**[44:47]** roughly equal Power

**[44:49]** to begin with.

**[44:52]** Rule number two

**[44:53]** is pay for your shit.

**[44:55]** I've mentioned this

**[44:56]** several times already,

**[44:57]** but this faction

**[44:58]** needs to pay so much

**[44:59]** Power in order to

**[45:00]** get all of their

**[45:00]** stuff.

**[45:01]** You really cannot

**[45:02]** be locked behind

**[45:04]** these payment plans

**[45:05]** toward the end of

**[45:06]** the game when other

**[45:07]** players are getting

**[45:08]** unlimited combat.

**[45:10]** Rituals in particular,

**[45:12]** obviously great if you

**[45:13]** can get two doom

**[45:13]** and an Elder Sign,

**[45:14]** for example,

**[45:15]** but you really don't

**[45:16]** want to be waiting

**[45:17]** until rituals cost

**[45:18]** like seven or eight

**[45:19]** Power.

**[45:19]** That is very bad

**[45:20]** for you.

**[45:20]** If you can,

**[45:22]** just bite the bullet,

**[45:23]** pay for five or six

**[45:24]** Power and get one

**[45:25]** doom and no elder

**[45:26]** signs if you have to.

**[45:27]** I do think that's

**[45:28]** better than like

**[45:29]** paying eight Power

**[45:30]** later.

**[45:30]** It's just too much.

**[45:33]** I would aim to get

**[45:34]** at least one of those

**[45:35]** pay three Power books

**[45:36]** per action phase.

**[45:38]** If you can,

**[45:38]** starting with action

**[45:39]** phase two,

**[45:40]** you can maybe double

**[45:41]** up on an especially

**[45:42]** good turn so that

**[45:43]** you can get to

**[45:44]** unlimited combat.

**[45:46]** My preferred spell

**[45:47]** book requirement to

**[45:48]** earn last with this

**[45:49]** faction is probably

**[45:50]** roll six dice just

**[45:51]** because I really,

**[45:52]** really want to get

**[45:52]** all my payments out

**[45:53]** of the way.

**[45:54]** That six dice is

**[45:55]** going to happen

**[45:56]** pretty naturally.

**[45:57]** And right,

**[45:57]** the main challenge

**[45:58]** for getting all

**[45:59]** your books is

**[46:00]** paying for all

**[46:01]** your books.

**[46:02]** So the sooner

**[46:02]** you can do that,

**[46:03]** the sooner you're

**[46:04]** on easy street and

**[46:04]** you can kind of do

**[46:05]** whatever you want

**[46:06]** the rest of the

**[46:07]** game.

**[46:09]** From here on

**[46:10]** playing sleeper,

**[46:11]** I've got kind of

**[46:12]** three levels of

**[46:13]** sleeper play and

**[46:14]** you need to

**[46:15]** understand and know

**[46:16]** when to use and

**[46:17]** not use each of

**[46:18]** these.

**[46:18]** Level one,

**[46:21]** lethargy spam.

**[46:22]** Everybody who's

**[46:22]** ever played against

**[46:23]** sleeper for at

**[46:24]** least one game,

**[46:25]** you've seen this.

**[46:26]** Sleeper just sits

**[46:27]** there and waits

**[46:28]** until everybody's

**[46:29]** out of Power and

**[46:30]** then they go and

**[46:30]** get a couple Gates

**[46:31]** and that's all

**[46:32]** they do.

**[46:32]** And it's pretty

**[46:33]** one-dimensional.

**[46:34]** New players,

**[46:35]** you're going to

**[46:35]** lose the game to

**[46:36]** this.

**[46:37]** You don't know

**[46:37]** any better.

**[46:38]** That's not your

**[46:38]** fault.

**[46:39]** It's okay.

**[46:40]** However,

**[46:41]** veteran players,

**[46:42]** they're not going

**[46:43]** to allow you to

**[46:44]** do this.

**[46:45]** They're going to

**[46:45]** make sure that you

**[46:46]** stay on one to two

**[46:47]** Gates and on the

**[46:48]** back foot on defense

**[46:49]** the entire game.

**[46:52]** Level two,

**[46:54]** you're still

**[46:54]** spamming lethargy,

**[46:56]** but this time

**[46:56]** you're in a really

**[46:57]** big ball with

**[46:58]** maybe all your

**[46:59]** accolades,

**[47:00]** lots of spawns.

**[47:02]** It's kind of a

**[47:03]** whole thing to

**[47:04]** unravel that ball.

**[47:07]** New players,

**[47:08]** they're never going

**[47:09]** to touch you.

**[47:09]** However,

**[47:10]** veteran players,

**[47:12]** especially players

**[47:13]** piloting the

**[47:14]** fighty factions,

**[47:14]** they are going to

**[47:16]** be able to

**[47:16]** crack your wall

**[47:17]** eventually and

**[47:18]** or cooperate to

**[47:20]** dissolve your

**[47:21]** defenses.

**[47:23]** Great Cthulhu,

**[47:24]** Windwalker,

**[47:25]** toward the end of

**[47:25]** the game,

**[47:26]** they can get

**[47:26]** easily over 20

**[47:27]** dice.

**[47:28]** That's going to

**[47:28]** be enough to

**[47:29]** at least pain you

**[47:30]** and kind of

**[47:30]** separate you out

**[47:31]** of that big

**[47:31]** ball.

**[47:32]** Obviously,

**[47:33]** if Crawling Chaos

**[47:33]** is in the game,

**[47:34]** you're in big

**[47:34]** trouble just trying

**[47:35]** to hide behind a

**[47:36]** wall because

**[47:37]** eventually madness

**[47:38]** is going to come

**[47:38]** into play and

**[47:40]** you're not going

**[47:40]** to be able to

**[47:41]** get pained where

**[47:41]** you want.

**[47:42]** So good players

**[47:43]** are going to

**[47:43]** cooperate to not

**[47:45]** let you get away

**[47:46]** with this lethargy

**[47:47]** tactic either.

**[47:50]** Finally,

**[47:51]** we have level 3

**[47:52]** which I think is

**[47:53]** the most advanced

**[47:54]** here but this is

**[47:56]** the truth.

**[47:56]** This is the way

**[47:57]** to play Sleeper.

**[47:58]** You need to

**[47:58]** alternate between

**[47:59]** sleeping,

**[48:01]** doing mean things,

**[48:02]** and then Burrow

**[48:03]** moving with the

**[48:04]** Toad and a

**[48:05]** Wizard in tow.

**[48:07]** As long as you're

**[48:08]** paying your Power

**[48:08]** more slowly than

**[48:09]** the other players,

**[48:10]** this is definitely

**[48:11]** the move.

**[48:13]** Nobody can be

**[48:14]** everywhere at once

**[48:14]** and if anybody

**[48:16]** moves in to react

**[48:17]** to what you're

**[48:18]** doing in your

**[48:18]** area, you can

**[48:19]** just leave if

**[48:20]** something bad is

**[48:21]** going to happen,

**[48:21]** right?

**[48:21]** But what I'm

**[48:22]** describing here is

**[48:24]** like you Burrow

**[48:25]** move into somebody's

**[48:26]** Gate, their great

**[48:27]** old one isn't

**[48:27]** there.

**[48:28]** If they don't do

**[48:29]** anything, obviously

**[48:30]** you're just going to

**[48:30]** capture them and

**[48:31]** take the good for

**[48:31]** yourself.

**[48:33]** If they do decide

**[48:34]** to move in and

**[48:35]** you've got all of

**[48:35]** your books, just

**[48:37]** wait.

**[48:37]** Just lethargy

**[48:38]** again.

**[48:38]** Let them be the

**[48:39]** one to pay for

**[48:40]** the battle and

**[48:40]** when they do,

**[48:41]** you can just

**[48:42]** Burrow move with

**[48:43]** Energy Nexus and

**[48:44]** get out of the

**[48:44]** way.

**[48:46]** Make them count on

**[48:47]** you spending Power

**[48:48]** and instead you can

**[48:49]** just trick them and

**[48:50]** sit there with

**[48:51]** lethargy.

**[48:53]** Once you have

**[48:53]** conditioned people to

**[48:55]** think that you're

**[48:56]** going to spend Power

**[48:57]** and not sleep, that's

**[48:58]** kind of the best

**[48:59]** place to be.

**[48:59]** You can kind of get

**[49:00]** people guessing on

**[49:01]** is sleeper going to

**[49:02]** sit there or are

**[49:03]** they actually going to

**[49:04]** do something?

**[49:04]** with this approach, I

**[49:07]** think it's really

**[49:08]** going to require a

**[49:10]** group project, multiple

**[49:11]** players to cooperate to

**[49:12]** really punish you for

**[49:13]** playing like this.

**[49:14]** Even then, they might

**[49:16]** have a hard time doing

**[49:16]** so if you're playing

**[49:17]** smart.

**[49:19]** If you have this

**[49:20]** pair of Sothogwa plus

**[49:23]** Wizard and Energy

**[49:24]** Nexus, you're probably

**[49:25]** only even letting

**[49:27]** people battle you on

**[49:28]** your terms.

**[49:28]** so hopefully

**[49:30]** whenever that happens

**[49:31]** you're just getting an

**[49:32]** Elder Sign more often

**[49:33]** than not.

**[49:34]** They're just going to

**[49:34]** be desperate to kill

**[49:35]** you at that point.

**[49:37]** Ideally, you can just

**[49:38]** alternate between

**[49:39]** Burrow moving with

**[49:40]** the Toad and the

**[49:41]** Wizard and Lethargy

**[49:42]** and doing meaningful

**[49:44]** things and sitting

**[49:45]** around waiting for

**[49:46]** people to do

**[49:47]** something about you.

**[49:48]** This is the way.

**[49:49]** Lethargy spam is not

**[49:50]** the way.

**[49:51]** The best players are

**[49:52]** not going to let you

**[49:53]** get away with things

**[49:54]** like that.

**[49:55]** Those are the three

**[49:56]** levels.

**[49:58]** More stuff on

**[50:00]** Ancient Sorcery.

**[50:02]** Just remember you can

**[50:03]** bank up your Power by

**[50:04]** placing Servantmen

**[50:05]** even if you're not

**[50:06]** using the abilities.

**[50:07]** That's going to be

**[50:07]** useful for paying for

**[50:09]** shit, in particular

**[50:10]** rituals.

**[50:13]** And again, just

**[50:13]** reiterating the

**[50:15]** must-copy abilities

**[50:16]** for Sleeper.

**[50:16]** If they're in the

**[50:17]** game, Flight and

**[50:18]** Hibernate.

**[50:18]** Do copy these and

**[50:20]** use them because they

**[50:21]** make your faction so

**[50:22]** much stronger than it

**[50:23]** already is.

**[50:25]** Flight's just going to

**[50:26]** give you an

**[50:26]** unparalleled ability in

**[50:28]** conjunction with

**[50:28]** Burrow to claim Gates

**[50:30]** after other players

**[50:31]** are out of position or

**[50:32]** out of Power.

**[50:34]** And yeah, on

**[50:34]** Hibernate, obviously

**[50:35]** your whole infrastructure

**[50:37]** of spellwork requirements

**[50:38]** revolves around paying

**[50:39]** lots of Power.

**[50:40]** Hibernation can be

**[50:41]** free Power, and

**[50:42]** especially with

**[50:43]** Lethargy, then

**[50:44]** Hibernate, you can

**[50:45]** easily get over 20

**[50:47]** Power this way by

**[50:48]** doing the Hibernate

**[50:49]** shenanigans that we

**[50:49]** know and love, and

**[50:51]** that's devastating for

**[50:51]** the opponents.

**[50:52]** If Windwalker's in

**[50:53]** the game, it is 100%

**[50:55]** their job to come and

**[50:56]** destroy you and not let

**[50:57]** you hibernate over and

**[50:59]** over again.

**[51:04]** More notes on

**[51:05]** defending stolen Gates.

**[51:07]** What this faction tends

**[51:08]** to do is wait around and

**[51:09]** then go steal Gates when

**[51:10]** players are out of Power,

**[51:11]** right?

**[51:12]** As the Serpent Men are

**[51:13]** being placed on the map,

**[51:14]** you can reinforce those

**[51:16]** stolen Gates.

**[51:17]** You've also got Death

**[51:17]** from Below, which can do

**[51:19]** the same thing.

**[51:20]** Once you have built up

**[51:22]** that spawn count, that

**[51:23]** can be particularly nice

**[51:24]** with Death from Below,

**[51:25]** just placing a random

**[51:26]** 5 combat spawn at a

**[51:28]** stolen Gate, that's

**[51:29]** pretty nice.

**[51:31]** And again, I've got the

**[51:32]** Cursed Slumber tactic

**[51:33]** here to mention as

**[51:34]** well.

**[51:34]** As you're stealing

**[51:35]** these Gates, think

**[51:36]** about in the following

**[51:37]** action phase, using the

**[51:39]** Cursed Slumber to get a

**[51:41]** Gate that is in danger

**[51:42]** right out of the way,

**[51:43]** and that's going to be

**[51:44]** pretty frustrating for

**[51:45]** players.

**[51:46]** If you stole a Gate from

**[51:47]** them and then it just

**[51:48]** disappears, it does

**[51:49]** really feel stolen and

**[51:50]** they're not going to get

**[51:51]** it back.

**[51:52]** So remember to do that.

**[51:53]** I think it's underrated.

**[51:54]** I don't see people use

**[51:55]** that enough.

**[51:59]** And the last thing on

**[52:00]** playing Sleeper is

**[52:02]** like punching.

**[52:02]** Do you need to punch?

**[52:04]** Assemble the spawns if

**[52:05]** you do.

**[52:06]** This is less expensive

**[52:06]** than it sounds because

**[52:07]** you have Burrow.

**[52:09]** Remember what I said

**[52:10]** earlier, if you start

**[52:11]** getting the full contingent

**[52:12]** of spawns, that's four

**[52:13]** of them, they roll 20

**[52:15]** dice by themselves, plus

**[52:16]** whatever Sothogwa has.

**[52:18]** If you do need to have

**[52:19]** like a straight up

**[52:20]** confrontation with a

**[52:21]** fighty faction, I

**[52:22]** think you can come out

**[52:23]** and win a battle if

**[52:24]** you bring Sothogwa

**[52:25]** and all the spawns.

**[52:25]** And then obviously

**[52:26]** you're hopefully getting

**[52:28]** an Elder Sign from

**[52:28]** Demand Sacrifice for

**[52:29]** your trouble here as

**[52:30]** well.

**[52:32]** And yeah, I think

**[52:33]** that's what I have to

**[52:34]** say on playing Sleeper.

**[52:36]** Hopefully I covered a

**[52:37]** lot.

**[52:37]** There's probably

**[52:38]** something I missed.

**[52:39]** I'm not a Sleeper

**[52:39]** main, but I have

**[52:41]** spent some time

**[52:41]** learning this one.

**[52:42]** Hopefully that was

**[52:43]** useful for you.

**[52:45]** Moving on to

**[52:47]** Thwarting Sleeper.

**[52:49]** Rule one is pick on

**[52:51]** them early.

**[52:53]** Without Sothogwa in play,

**[52:54]** this faction is pretty

**[52:55]** frail.

**[52:56]** So don't feel bad going

**[52:57]** after them in Action

**[52:58]** Phase 1 if they build a

**[53:00]** Gate.

**[53:00]** This is greedy on their

**[53:01]** part.

**[53:03]** If you can keep Sleeper

**[53:04]** on one Gate, that's going

**[53:05]** to slow down their whole

**[53:06]** plan by a good

**[53:07]** march in.

**[53:09]** And yeah, don't let the

**[53:10]** Sleeper player claim the

**[53:11]** victim.

**[53:12]** This is a villain faction.

**[53:13]** Like anything you do to

**[53:14]** them, they probably deserve

**[53:15]** it.

**[53:17]** Rule number two, never

**[53:19]** stop talking about killing

**[53:20]** Sothogwa with others.

**[53:22]** If the Sleeper player is

**[53:23]** good, it's pretty unlikely

**[53:25]** that you're going to be

**[53:25]** able to beat them by

**[53:26]** yourself.

**[53:27]** It's kind of a group

**[53:28]** project if they know what

**[53:29]** they're doing.

**[53:30]** Don't stop discussing the

**[53:32]** virtual Gates that Sleeper

**[53:33]** could claim if they wait

**[53:35]** everybody out with

**[53:35]** lethargy.

**[53:36]** Do not be swayed by

**[53:38]** offers of three free

**[53:40]** Power or one Power

**[53:41]** apiece.

**[53:42]** Generally, this is not a

**[53:43]** gift, so do not treat it

**[53:44]** like one.

**[53:47]** Plan for the killing

**[53:48]** blow with yourself and

**[53:50]** others to make sure you

**[53:51]** kill Sothogwa through

**[53:52]** energy nexus and demand

**[53:54]** sacrifice.

**[53:55]** It's going to be tricky to

**[53:56]** do that alone, but with

**[53:58]** help, you can make it

**[53:58]** happen.

**[54:00]** And lastly, after you

**[54:01]** kill Sothogwa, make sure

**[54:03]** you hunt for those

**[54:04]** formless spawns.

**[54:05]** Sothogwa cannot come back

**[54:06]** if they aren't on the

**[54:07]** board, so after killing

**[54:09]** this great old one is a

**[54:10]** great time to also hunt

**[54:11]** down and kill the spawns.

**[54:14]** Rule number three, if

**[54:16]** Sleeper did have a good

**[54:17]** turn, make sure you hunt

**[54:19]** down and capture their

**[54:20]** acolytes with extreme

**[54:21]** prejudice.

**[54:23]** This is kind of like a

**[54:24]** fundamental Cthulhu Wars

**[54:25]** concept here, but if you

**[54:27]** capture three to four

**[54:28]** acolytes from an enemy,

**[54:29]** it does not matter how

**[54:30]** much Power or difference

**[54:31]** they have over you,

**[54:33]** they're not going to be

**[54:33]** able to hold down that

**[54:34]** many Gates if they don't

**[54:35]** have that many Cultists to

**[54:36]** control them.

**[54:38]** I'd say Sleeper Cultists

**[54:40]** are up there for like the

**[54:41]** most wanted for captures,

**[54:43]** raid aside like Demon's

**[54:44]** Sultan Cultists.

**[54:45]** If you ever have the

**[54:46]** chance to capture random

**[54:48]** Sleeper Cultists, you

**[54:49]** should definitely do so

**[54:50]** because they will cause

**[54:51]** trouble later if you

**[54:52]** don't.

**[54:56]** And yeah, I think that

**[54:57]** is most of the faction

**[54:58]** guide said here.

**[55:00]** I'll move on to my

**[55:01]** closing thoughts.

**[55:04]** You're probably still

**[55:05]** wondering, is this the

**[55:06]** best faction in the game?

**[55:07]** I actually think it might

**[55:08]** be in the right hands.

**[55:10]** Not all Sleeper players

**[55:11]** are equal, but I have

**[55:12]** seen some of the best on

**[55:14]** Tabletop Simulator on the

**[55:16]** Cthulhu Wars Discord, and

**[55:17]** yeah, in the right hands,

**[55:18]** it is just very hard to

**[55:19]** stop this one.

**[55:21]** If you're ever concerned

**[55:22]** about Sleeper being too

**[55:24]** strong, a couple of

**[55:25]** balance adjustments that

**[55:26]** were made on Tabletop

**[55:27]** Simulator I kind of

**[55:28]** recommend.

**[55:29]** A few changes to some

**[55:30]** Spellbooks here.

**[55:31]** I'll just go over them

**[55:32]** really quickly for you.

**[55:33]** First one, demand

**[55:34]** sacrifice.

**[55:35]** It only works in

**[55:36]** Sothogwa's area.

**[55:37]** You won't even notice

**[55:39]** this change in function

**[55:40]** 95% of the time, since

**[55:42]** mainly opponents are only

**[55:43]** going to be fighting you

**[55:44]** where they think they can

**[55:45]** kill Sothogwa anyway,

**[55:47]** right?

**[55:47]** But just nice quality of

**[55:49]** life improvement doesn't

**[55:50]** let you demand sacrifice

**[55:52]** when the opponent's trying

**[55:53]** to battle a random

**[55:55]** serpent man and an

**[55:56]** accolade on a Gate.

**[55:57]** Kind of flavor fail in

**[55:58]** that case, if you ask me.

**[56:01]** Second change is making

**[56:03]** Energy Nexus into a

**[56:04]** bonafide pre-battle

**[56:05]** ability.

**[56:07]** This one also makes a

**[56:08]** ton of sense to me.

**[56:09]** Right now, as written,

**[56:11]** it's kind of like a

**[56:12]** pre-pre-battle.

**[56:13]** It's the only one of

**[56:14]** its kind.

**[56:15]** Just a little bit

**[56:16]** awkward.

**[56:17]** This change just brings

**[56:17]** it more in line with

**[56:18]** other abilities like

**[56:20]** Invisibility, Devour,

**[56:22]** and brings much needed

**[56:23]** windows of interaction

**[56:24]** between this faction

**[56:26]** and Crawling Chaos,

**[56:27]** Great Cthulhu,

**[56:28]** others.

**[56:30]** Attackers trigger

**[56:31]** pre-battles first,

**[56:32]** so this means Sleeper

**[56:33]** needs to then play

**[56:34]** around Devour,

**[56:35]** Invisibility,

**[56:36]** but it's not really

**[56:37]** asking all that much.

**[56:38]** So let me just give

**[56:39]** you an example of how

**[56:41]** current Energy Nexus

**[56:42]** is a bit problematic.

**[56:44]** So Great Cthulhu has

**[56:45]** unlimited combat,

**[56:46]** they fight Sleeper,

**[56:47]** and yeah, Sleeper just

**[56:48]** leaves the battle

**[56:49]** every single time.

**[56:50]** Cthulhu is left

**[56:51]** wondering what happened.

**[56:53]** With this change,

**[56:54]** at least, Sleeper will

**[56:55]** need to satisfy

**[56:57]** that Devour,

**[56:58]** and it's not asking

**[56:59]** all that much.

**[57:00]** They'll just need to have

**[57:01]** an accolade in the area

**[57:01]** or something,

**[57:02]** in addition to the Toad

**[57:03]** and the Wizard.

**[57:04]** It's not really a big change

**[57:06]** and just kind of like

**[57:07]** brings it in line

**[57:08]** with the other abilities

**[57:09]** in the game.

**[57:09]** This one also makes

**[57:10]** a lot of sense to me.

**[57:13]** As you continue your career

**[57:15]** in Cthulhu Wars

**[57:16]** as a player,

**[57:17]** hopefully you come around

**[57:18]** on this faction.

**[57:19]** I definitely was not a fan

**[57:20]** when I started.

**[57:21]** When I was one of those

**[57:21]** new players,

**[57:22]** I got stomped by this faction

**[57:23]** many, many times,

**[57:25]** and I really disliked

**[57:26]** playing against it.

**[57:27]** And even when I started

**[57:28]** playing it,

**[57:29]** I really didn't like it.

**[57:30]** But like I've said

**[57:31]** for other factions,

**[57:32]** play what you hate

**[57:33]** and that might change.

**[57:35]** I've come around

**[57:36]** on this one

**[57:36]** I really, really enjoy,

**[57:37]** particularly the

**[57:39]** Ancient Sorcery bit

**[57:40]** where you can kind of

**[57:41]** choose and mix and match

**[57:42]** what abilities you get.

**[57:44]** There's so much potential

**[57:44]** for creativity,

**[57:46]** so I really enjoy

**[57:47]** that bit about this faction.

**[57:49]** Hopefully I inspired

**[57:51]** with this guide

**[57:52]** at least one Sleeper player

**[57:53]** who thinks lethargy spamming

**[57:55]** is the only viable strategy.

**[57:56]** Hopefully I inspired

**[57:57]** you to branch out.

**[57:59]** Try this like roaming

**[58:00]** toad plus wizard

**[58:01]** plus energy nexus strategy.

**[58:03]** I think that might

**[58:04]** just be the best thing

**[58:05]** that you can be doing

**[58:06]** in the entire game.

**[58:09]** And yeah,

**[58:10]** I think that is probably

**[58:11]** another episode

**[58:11]** in the books here.

**[58:13]** I think this is actually

**[58:14]** going to be the last

**[58:15]** faction guide that I do

**[58:16]** for a while,

**[58:17]** and I'll talk more about

**[58:18]** that in the next episode here.

**[58:20]** Thanks for listening.

**[58:22]** Hope you found

**[58:22]** this guide useful.
