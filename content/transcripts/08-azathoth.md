## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, welcome to another episode of Opening the Way. My name's Graham, I'm your host.

**[00:23]** Hope you're doing well. I'm feeling a little rough this morning. Yesterday was my wedding

**[00:30]** anniversary. We went out for Korean food for dinner, and I had a couple of drinks. A soju

**[00:38]** bomb, kind of like an Irish car bomb, but with soju, which is like a kind of alcohol. Very tasty.

**[00:45]** Did a little bit of a number on me, but not enough that I didn't want to record today, so here I am.

**[00:49]** Today, I want to talk to you about the Azathoth Neutral Expansion, not to be confused with the

**[01:00]** Demon Sultan Faction Expansion, which is part of Onslaught 4 and has yet to be released physically

**[01:06]** in much of the world as of recording. This is going to be our first exploration into neutral units,

**[01:14]** which, if you listened to my intro episode, I do plan to cover all the neutral expansions,

**[01:19]** even if I've not played many times with them. I will cover them in detail and give you my thoughts

**[01:25]** if I haven't used them myself. This expansion has three different components. It's got the neutral

**[01:34]** Spellbooks, neutral monsters, and one great old one that's Azathoth. I'm going to break this guide

**[01:41]** into three parts and just kind of go over each of those parts one at a time. Let's talk about

**[01:49]** neutral Spellbooks. There are six of them in this expansion, and I'm going to explain how they work.

**[01:55]** These Spellbooks are unique gameplay items. When you fulfill one of your faction Spellbook requirements,

**[02:01]** you may take an Azathoth Spellbook instead of a faction Spellbook from your pool. Once you take a

**[02:07]** neutral Spellbook, it is yours. No one else can earn it. You retain that Spellbook throughout the game,

**[02:13]** with the exception of one of those is recriminations I'll talk about later. This means that you will not

**[02:20]** have access to one of your faction Spellbooks in the game. Choosing the right neutral Spellbook and when

**[02:26]** is something that should not be taken lightly. A neutral Spellbook counts as one of your six Spellbooks

**[02:33]** needed on your faction card to allow you to perform unlimited battle and win the game, as well as

**[02:38]** counting for any other rules or abilities that reference your faction card's Spellbooks, such as

**[02:45]** Gnarlathotep's combat or something like a moon beast. You've got no idea what a moon beast is. That's okay.

**[02:52]** So just a quick example. Let's say that Black Goat awakens Shub for the first time. Instead of taking one of

**[03:00]** their own Spellbooks, Black Goat could instead choose to select a neutral Spellbook. Maybe they would

**[03:05]** choose undimensioned. I'll just transition right into talking about that one. The undimensioned Spellbook.

**[03:12]** It's a two-cost action. You can rearrange your units among their areas as you see fit. You may

**[03:19]** completely empty an area, but you may not place units into any areas you did not occupy immediately

**[03:26]** before using this ability. This is a pretty cool ability. Two-cost is pretty expensive, but it makes

**[03:33]** sense because it really allows you to effectively move all of your units and kind of reposition,

**[03:39]** rearrange yourself any way that you want. You can concentrate all of your units into one area, or maybe

**[03:46]** you have a really heavily defended area and a bunch of other lightly defended areas. You can kind of

**[03:50]** evenly distribute your units across all of the Gates that you want to defend. Once you have unlimited

**[03:57]** combat, I think this book gets even stronger on the defense. If somebody comes into your area, you can

**[04:03]** just choose to rearrange a bunch of units into the area that they just moved into and fight them.

**[04:09]** If you're able to get your unlimited combat before them, that is. I really like this book for

**[04:15]** specifically Black Goat, Demon Sultan, and Opener. Black Goat, you're going to want to, after you've

**[04:22]** spread out, maybe hunker down into a couple of areas that make them very hard for other players to

**[04:28]** grab. Undimensioned is going to let you do that and not really cost you a lot of Power to move.

**[04:35]** Demon Sultan factions are going to want to really punch you in the face at some point during the game,

**[04:40]** and it's going to be really nice to, like, contract into several areas where you have all your great

**[04:46]** old ones, a bunch of acolytes, and a bunch of monsters. Opener, this can also be nice. I like this

**[04:53]** with the Million Favored Ones Spellbook where you can upgrade your units. Sometimes you end up with

**[05:00]** opener units that are kind of in, like, random areas and not that useful. The use Undimensioned,

**[05:05]** you can bring them all into one area, get off a battle, and then upgrade a bunch of units,

**[05:11]** which is really what you want to be doing with that Million Favored Ones book.

**[05:16]** Let's talk about another book. I'm going to butcher the name of this one, but I, to be fair,

**[05:21]** I don't think that there's a correct pronunciation. This is Mur Atwill. Mur Atwill, maybe.

**[05:30]** It's an ongoing ability. Gates cost you one less Power to create. Pretty simple book, honestly.

**[05:39]** Every faction likes this. Just cheapening one of the core resources that you use in the game

**[05:44]** is really, really cool, but I would especially shout out the engine factions such as Demon Sultan,

**[05:52]** Ancients, Chocho, Yellow Sign. Any faction that wants to get a lot of doom and fast is going to

**[05:59]** really like this book. Just be able to create some Gates on the cheap. Maybe you're trying to win

**[06:04]** on a ritual the following turn. Mur Atwill is going to let you do that. What's going on with the name,

**[06:12]** though? It's a pretty weird name. I actually know the answer to this. So this is an entity from a

**[06:18]** story called Through the Gates of the Silver Key, which HP Lovecraft wrote with someone called E.

**[06:25]** Hoffman Price. This is a sequel to the story The Silver Key by HP Lovecraft, which is itself

**[06:31]** a continuation of the adventures of Randolph Carter in the dream quest to unknown Kadath.

**[06:39]** I'll even read you a little bit from it.

**[06:41]** The affair that shambleth about in the night, the evil that defieth the Elder Sign, the herd

**[06:48]** that stand watch over the secret portal each tomb is known to have, and that thrive on that

**[06:54]** which groweth out of the tenants within. All these blacknesses are lesser than he who guardeth the

**[07:00]** Gateway, he who will guide the rash one beyond all the worlds into the abyss of unnameable devourers.

**[07:07]** For he is more at towill, the most ancient one, which the scribe rendereth as the prolonged of life.

**[07:17]** Pretty cool, pretty metal-sounding ancient one, great old one. Not sure what Lovecraft was going for there.

**[07:24]** Third Spellbook, the Malice Ceremony. This is Gather Power. At the end of Gather Power phase,

**[07:31]** after applying minimum Power but before termining the first player, you may eliminate any of your own

**[07:36]** Cultists, gaining one Power for each eliminated in this way. Crazy book. This one is really, really,

**[07:43]** really strong. It's going to give you extra Power, which every faction is interested in at all times.

**[07:49]** It's going to put acolytes into your pool, which is useful for you so you can re-recruit them later

**[07:53]** anywhere else that it is convenient. I would say any factions that like having acolytes in their pool

**[08:01]** or being able to relocate them are really going to like this, so I'm thinking about Great Cthulhu,

**[08:07]** who may want to have them for dreams purposes. It's also going to give you more Power for dreams.

**[08:12]** Demon Sultan obviously is going to get a bunch of free psychosises, ideally, if you are using this.

**[08:19]** I could see Demon Sultan just giving up most or all of their acolytes for that reason.

**[08:23]** It's more Power for your great old ones and more stalling for you.

**[08:27]** Just seems like an awesome book for them. Yellow Sign is another good one. Notably,

**[08:32]** this does not work with Passion. That's only enemies killing or eliminating your acolytes,

**[08:37]** but Yellow Sign does like having acolytes in their pool to recruit later. You're going to be

**[08:44]** traveling around with the King in Yellow or Haster. It's handy to have an acolyte in your back pocket

**[08:50]** if you need it for the extra Gate. Black Goat is another one as well. If you're working on

**[08:56]** spreading out, you're going to have acolytes that you don't care about, and you're going to be able

**[09:01]** to kind of eliminate them, get them back into your pool, re-recruit them in the areas that you want

**[09:06]** them in later to reinforce and stay safe. Another book, The Stars Are Right. During the Doom phase,

**[09:14]** if you turn in Elder Signs for Doom points, you also receive Power immediately equal to their value.

**[09:21]** Pretty interesting ability asking you if you want to reveal your Elder Signs early.

**[09:26]** Typically, that doesn't happen that often, except for political reasons. Like,

**[09:30]** you might want to show off your ones so that people will leave you alone and show them you

**[09:35]** don't actually have that much doom. But it doesn't matter what your Elder Signs are,

**[09:39]** you're going to want to reveal them for this. Power is just a resource that everybody wants

**[09:43]** as much of as possible, but the faction's best positions to take advantage of this are any

**[09:49]** faction that loves to ritual or accumulate Elder Signs for any reason. So Black Goat, Cho's,

**[09:56]** Yellow Sign, Demon Sultan, The Cats, Bubastus, also tend to get a bunch of Elder Signs. This is just

**[10:02]** going to give you more Power to do more of that later. Great book. One of the strongest, I think,

**[10:08]** of all of these. I'd maybe say Stars Are Right and Mal Ceremony are my picks for strongest books.

**[10:14]** Next book, Shriveling. Pre-battle ability. Select an enemy monster or ocCultist in the battle.

**[10:20]** That unit is eliminated and its owner received Power equal to the unit's cost.

**[10:26]** So, interesting to note about this ability. Normally, in Cthulhu Wars, when you're on the

**[10:30]** receiving end of kills or pains or you're being targeted by a Spellbook, maybe a Dreams or a Zengai,

**[10:37]** that kind of thing, you're choosing the thing that you eliminate. In the case of Shriveling,

**[10:43]** it's actually letting you choose the thing. So this is more similar to invisibility that Flying

**[10:51]** Polyps have from Crawling Chaos. Kind of a weird ability. You're going to give people Power for

**[10:56]** this, but I'd say it's good against any unit that's going to roll a lot of dice against you.

**[11:01]** I like this against maybe a Formless Spawn, which is kind of important for a sleeper, or maybe a

**[11:07]** spawn of Yogg-Sototh from Opener. Although, you are going to give them the Power to reawaken it again.

**[11:14]** It's just a way to take advantage of a battle and make sure they're not hitting you as hard as you're

**[11:20]** hitting them. For that reason, I like this one with any kind of combat faction like a Great Cthulhu,

**[11:26]** a Windwalker, a Crawling Chaos, or even Woobastus, the cats. I'm going to try to keep mentioning the

**[11:33]** cats more frequently because I am going to write a cat guide at some point. Last neutral Spellbook,

**[11:39]** I saved for last because it really doesn't make sense to talk about it earlier than that,

**[11:42]** is Recriminations. It's a one-cost action to remove any Spellbook, including this one,

**[11:49]** from your faction card, and replace it with another available Spellbook. Really strange book this, so

**[11:55]** I think this is for people who definitely want to take multiple Azathoth Spellbooks, but they maybe

**[12:03]** want to play the long game. I think players are typically not going to want to take too many of

**[12:08]** these books because your normal faction books are quite good and they work with your faction well,

**[12:13]** obviously. I would only take Recriminations if you're trying to do something really wild and take

**[12:17]** two additional Spellbooks. I don't think that you're going to get some of the strongest books doing

**[12:23]** this. I believe Stars are Right and Mal Ceremony are the strongest books. I doubt it if you're going

**[12:29]** to get these if you take Recrimination first, but it is an option. Maybe the other players aren't as into

**[12:35]** the neutral books. Maybe you can go for like a heavy Spellbook strategy where you replace a lot of

**[12:40]** them. Yeah, weird book. Try this one. Haven't used it myself, to be honest, so I can't really comment

**[12:45]** here on what factions this is good with. That is like a very deep thinking experiment that I'm really

**[12:52]** not prepared for in this guide, to be honest. Next section of this guide, we're going to talk about

**[12:58]** neutral monsters. Introduction to neutrals in Cthulhu Wars. Generally, they work like this. In the doom

**[13:07]** phase, you can pay two doom, not Power, to take a loyalty card for a neutral monster. Usually,

**[13:14]** and there's an asterisk here, you get one or more of those monsters for free at your controlled Gate

**[13:20]** at this time. From here on out, you then have access to the monsters in your pool for the rest of the

**[13:26]** game. You can summon them for whatever cost they have on their card at your controlled Gate.

**[13:33]** I said asterisk earlier because there's a lot of exceptions, including some of the neutrals I'm about

**[13:38]** to discuss, so best bet is to just read the specific loyalty card of any neutral monster that you are

**[13:45]** considering joining your team. First neutral monster, let's talk about the dimensional shamblers.

**[13:53]** You've got three of them. They cost two Power to summon, and they have two combat. I believe these first

**[14:00]** appeared in the story, not really appeared, in a way they appeared, in the story The Horror in the Museum

**[14:07]** by H.P. Lovecraft that he wrote with Hazel Heald. Do you think I made all my effigies? Why not say

**[14:15]** preserved? You know by this time the strange places I've been to, and the strange things I've brought

**[14:21]** back. Coward, you could never face the dimensional shambler whose hide I put on to scare you,

**[14:27]** the mere sight of it alive, or even the full-fledged thought of it, would kill you instantly with

**[14:33]** fright. Yeah, yeah, it waits hungry for the blood that is alive. The dimensional shamblers are pretty

**[14:42]** crazy looking. They kind of look like a contorted person. They have a much, much oversized mouth and

**[14:50]** skull area, and they're kind of contorting in a really gross way. They've got three-toed feet

**[14:57]** like some kind of bird, and their toes are facing the opposite direction. It's like pretty gross,

**[15:01]** pretty painful looking, but hey, it's not me. To get the dimensional shambler, you're going to pay

**[15:08]** two doom points to obtain the loyalty card, and then you're going to place one dimensional shambler

**[15:13]** onto your faction card. This is already different from what I said earlier, so just go with me on this.

**[15:19]** You do not get one at your Gate, you get one on your faction card, and that's going to make sense

**[15:23]** with their ability Walk Between Worlds. It's an ongoing ability when summoning a dimensional

**[15:29]** shambler, that's for two Power. Place it onto your faction card. After any action by any player,

**[15:36]** you may place one or more dimensional shamblers from your faction card into any area. Once placed,

**[15:42]** dimensional shamblers remain on the map until killed or otherwise eliminated. So very spicy ability

**[15:49]** here. This is another High Priest devolve-like timing here. This is one of my personal favorite

**[15:55]** neutral monsters. I've used this one probably a handful of times. I find it is very good with any

**[16:00]** faction, honestly, but I really like it with any faction who want to protect their great old ones.

**[16:06]** So think Yellow Sign, Black Goat, Demon Sultan, Crawling Chaos, or Bubastus with their Elder God.

**[16:13]** Very fun to pay for these shamblers. Sometimes people forget about them, and all of a sudden they

**[16:21]** move into your area and they want to fight you, and you've just suddenly added several bodies and

**[16:25]** four to six dice into the battle. Let's talk about another one. That's Servitors of the Elder Gods.

**[16:33]** You have three of them. They cost one, and they have a combat of one. They look just kind of like a nasty

**[16:42]** tentacly thing with looks like four or five eyes. They're playing a little flute. I really like this.

**[16:49]** These are like the pipers who are playing their monotonous cursed flutes to keep Azathoth asleep

**[16:58]** and keep our reality existing. So they're actually some of the good guys, you could say. Another weird

**[17:05]** loyalty card situation. You pay two Doom to give this loyalty card to another player. That player now

**[17:12]** keeps this card for the rest of the game. Do not place a Servitor. So you gave this to somebody,

**[17:18]** and you didn't get anything out of it, but what is it doing to them? The ability here is Adulation.

**[17:24]** Ongoing ability. You may not summon any monsters except for Servitors if any remain in your pool.

**[17:31]** You may still place other monsters on the map via abilities or means other than the summon action.

**[17:36]** So this is a pretty mean one. You are giving somebody efficiently costed monsters. They are

**[17:43]** one cost, one combat. That's not bad. That's the same rate as a Deep One. But importantly,

**[17:48]** it shuts off their abilities to get more expensive things and adequately defend themselves with combat

**[17:54]** dice for a while. Notably, if you're playing with neutrals, you're probably playing with more than one

**[18:00]** neutral. So this can shut off access for a while for somebody summoning the neutrals they just bought.

**[18:05]** They will get the first one from getting the loyalty card, probably. But from there,

**[18:10]** if it's expensive, you're going to stop them from doing it by giving them the Servitor.

**[18:14]** I like this one against specifically like a Demon Sultan or any faction that needs a specific kind

**[18:22]** of unit in play. For Demon Sultan, it's going to deny them the ability to summon a larva for three

**[18:28]** actions, which is kind of a big deal. They want to get their great old ones out as soon as possible.

**[18:31]** Also good against opener will prevent the summoning of a spawn, although I will say good opener players

**[18:38]** probably are going to not summon them too often. They're going to be using million favorite ones,

**[18:43]** so keep that in mind. I really like this one against sleeper. It prevents formless spawn from

**[18:49]** being summoned, which are important for awakening Sothagua. Also important for having more of them,

**[18:54]** having more than one increases their combat. It's also going to prevent death from below

**[18:59]** from placing higher cost units. This is because death from below, you always need to place your

**[19:04]** least expensive monster in the pool first. So yeah, kind of a hateful neutral here. Not for the faint of heart.

**[19:15]** Let's talk about the Elder Things. There's three of them. They cost two Power to summon,

**[19:21]** and they have two combat. These show up in the Mountains of Madness.

**[19:28]** 10.15 PM. Important discovery. More and different Watkins working underground at 945 with light

**[19:35]** found a monstrous barrel-shaped fossil of wholly unknown nature, probably vegetable and less overgrown

**[19:41]** specimen of unknown marine radiacea. Pissue evidentially preserved by mineral salts,

**[19:47]** tough as leather but astonishingly flexibly retained in places. Marks of broken-off parts at ends and

**[19:55]** around sides. Six feet end-to-end. 3.5 feet central diameter, tapering to one foot at each end,

**[20:02]** like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place of staves. Lateral breakages as of thinnish stalks

**[20:09]** are at equator in middle of these ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious growths,

**[20:15]** combs or wings that fold up and spread out like fans, all greatly damaged but one, which gives

**[20:21]** almost seven-foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal myth,

**[20:27]** especially the fabled Elder Things in Necronomicon.

**[20:31]** These wings seem to be membranous, stretching on framework of glandular tubing, apparent minute

**[20:37]** orifices in frame tubing at wingtips, ends of body shriveled, giving no clue to interior or what

**[20:44]** has been broken off there. Must dissect when we get back to camp. Can't decide whether vegetable or

**[20:50]** animal. This is an example of people who designed these sculpts definitely read these stories and it

**[20:56]** almost seems like the sculpt is coming directly from the description in the story.

**[21:02]** You're going to pay two Doom points to obtain this loyalty card and then you place one Elder Thing

**[21:07]** at one of your controlled Gates. So this is a normal neutral placing units in the normal way that

**[21:13]** neutrals do. The ability of Elder Things is mind control. It's an ongoing ability. If an Elder

**[21:20]** Thing shares an area with an enemy Great Old One, the latter may not use its special ability.

**[21:26]** Oof, this is a solid one. It's just solid all around. It's really mean. The ability to shut off

**[21:31]** specials is very strong. It messes with a lot of Great Old Ones. Crawling Chaos, no more Harbinger,

**[21:37]** Great Cthulhu, no more Devour, way less scary in combat. Demon Sultan, no more Cosmic Ruler,

**[21:43]** so fuck you. Yellow Sign, shutting off Haster's Vengeance, things like that. The applications here,

**[21:49]** there's just so many of them. This is a really strong neutral. It's got a good cost. It's got a good rate.

**[21:55]** Anybody that can bring these around with them, like a Submerge or an Arctic Wind, you're going to want to

**[22:00]** have these in the battle with you. They're just going to help you take down enemy Great Old Ones

**[22:04]** with ease. Last neutral monster here, we've got the Star Vampires. I think these first appeared in

**[22:13]** the story Shambler from the Stars by Robert Block. A reddish glow filled the corner by the window,

**[22:20]** a bloody glow. Slowly but surely, the dim outlines of a presence came into view,

**[22:25]** the blood-filled outlines of that unseen Shambler from the Stars. It was red and dripping,

**[22:31]** an immensity of pulsing, moving jelly, a scarlet blob with myriad pentacular trunks that waved and

**[22:38]** waved. There were suckers on the tips of the appendages, and these were opening and closing

**[22:43]** with a Ghoulish lust. The thing was bloated and obscene, a headless, faceless, eyeless bulk with the

**[22:50]** ravenous maw and titanic talons of a star-born monster. The human blood on which it had fed

**[22:56]** revealed the hitherto invisible outlines of the feaster. It was not a sight for sane eyes to see.

**[23:03]** Love the description of the Star Vampire in the story there, and the sculpt is like

**[23:09]** directly looking exactly like this. I couldn't really describe it better than the story itself.

**[23:14]** Quick aside on Robert Bloch himself, just want to blow your mind really quickly. So who's Robert

**[23:21]** Bloch? He is, I'd say, a contemporary of Lovecraft, but went on to have a whole life as a successful

**[23:27]** story writer. One story that you already know of Robert Bloch's but didn't know that you know,

**[23:32]** if you've ever seen the Hitchcock film Psycho, or god forbid you've seen the remake with Vince Vaughn,

**[23:40]** Psycho was based on a story that Robert Bloch wrote of the same name. He basically knew Lovecraft

**[23:48]** right at the end of Lovecraft's life, so I thought that was very very interesting to learn that about

**[23:52]** him. Like I said, he went on to write a bunch of books, but he wrote a lot of weird fiction,

**[23:57]** cosmic horror early on. There's like several collections of his stories out there. I recommend

**[24:02]** all of them. You'll definitely hear his name come up more than once in this cast. Anyway, now that

**[24:07]** literary stuff is out of the way, let's talk about the Star Vampires. You've got three of them.

**[24:12]** They cost two to summon, and they have one combat. Pay two doom to obtain this loyalty card, then place

**[24:18]** one Star Vampire at one of your controlled Gates. Their ongoing ability is Vampirism. Roll each Star

**[24:25]** Vampire's combat dice separately. For each pain they roll, it drains one Power from the enemy faction.

**[24:31]** Each kill they roll drains one doom point from the enemy faction. The drained points are transferred to

**[24:36]** you immediately. If the enemy faction lacks Power or doom points, you don't get anything.

**[24:43]** Pains and kills rolled still count toward your battle results.

**[24:47]** Really cool monster here. I think it's just a solid one all around. If it can ever roll results,

**[24:52]** you're never going to be unhappy to have Power or doom. I like this one in particular against

**[24:57]** doom-loving factions like Chocho, Yellow Sign, Bubastus, Demon Sultan. Any doom you're going to be able to

**[25:04]** drain away from them is a good thing. Like I said, any results is good with this. It's just a strong,

**[25:09]** neutral, any faction will love this. In particular, any faction like Great Cthulhu or Windwalker,

**[25:16]** which can cheaply move around with the vampires and declare battles with them, is worth considering.

**[25:22]** I also like this one maybe with a burrow from Sleeper or a flight from Crawling Chaos to get into

**[25:27]** position. Okay, the final part of this guide, we will talk about the Independent Great Old One,

**[25:35]** which comes with this box, and that is Azathoth. When you awaken an Independent Great Old One,

**[25:42]** you take its loyalty card and you place the figure on the map under your control. Add its Spellbook

**[25:47]** and any tokens to your pool. There is no limit to how many independents you may control.

**[25:52]** You may use an Independent to help waken another one. If I have Azathoth, that means it can also

**[26:00]** help me awaken other Independent Great Old Ones itself. Death. If your Independent Great Old One is

**[26:06]** killed, place its loyalty card, figure, unused tokens, and Spellbook back into the general pool.

**[26:11]** Any tokens on the map remain there. If you've earned this Spellbook, it falls off its loyalty card

**[26:17]** and is no longer in effect. If this Independent Great Old One is awakened again, even by the same

**[26:22]** player, the Spellbook must be earned again. So, as opposed to the neutral monsters, Independent Great

**[26:29]** Old Ones, they stop being loyal to you when they die. They will be up for grabs for other players,

**[26:34]** so that is an incentive for other players to come kill them. Spellbook. Each Independent Great Old One

**[26:40]** has its own Spellbook to be earned. When the requirements are met, place the Spellbook on the

**[26:45]** loyalty card and reap its benefits so long as you control the Independent Great Old One.

**[26:49]** This does not count as one of your faction Spellbooks for any purpose, so that just means you can't place

**[26:54]** it on your faction card. Not to be confused with the neutral Spellbooks we discussed earlier on in the

**[26:59]** guide. Azathoth is the Cosmic Ruler. It's the Blind Idiot God. It's also known as the Demon Sultan.

**[27:08]** Not to be confused with the Demon Sultan faction. This came first. Right here, you've only got a single

**[27:14]** great old one. It's very big. It looks a bit like a... some kind of a starfish. Kind of five main tentacles,

**[27:22]** lots more tentacles on the back. It's got five eyes on it. Azathoth is the Blind Idiot God, so I'm not

**[27:29]** sure what those eyes are doing exactly, but it can't be good. Got a couple of mouths. Very suggestive

**[27:35]** looking mouth there. Whoa. How to awaken Azathoth. Kind of a steep cost here. You must have eight or more

**[27:44]** Power and your great old one at your controlled Gate. Roll one die and add two to the total, then lose that much

**[27:50]** Power. So this is a minimum of three and a maximum of eight. You may have an Azathoth die. You may have a d6.

**[27:57]** Either one will work. All enemy players choose and simultaneously reveal a die face. This is a d6.

**[28:05]** Each player receives Power equal to their revealed number, so that's going to be something between one

**[28:11]** and six. The players with the lowest score lose two doom points. Sum the dice and place the Azathoth glyph

**[28:19]** on that spot on the Doom Track. Place Azathoth at your controlled Gate. If someone tries to lowball

**[28:26]** the Power here, they're going to lose two doom. So you're incentivized to pay a little bit more,

**[28:33]** but your opponents are going to get Power here as well. And Azathoth's combat is equal to the

**[28:39]** position of the glyph on the Doom Track. So the more Power players chose to gain, the stronger

**[28:46]** Azathoth is going to be. Azathoth's ability is Demon Sultan. If Azathoth is assigned to kill in a

**[28:53]** battle, roll one die. This is a d6. Lower the Azathoth marker by the amount shown on the die.

**[29:00]** If the marker reaches zero, Azathoth is killed. Azathoth has a Spellbook requirement, like all

**[29:07]** independent great old ones do. This one, all players must have at least one great old one in

**[29:13]** play. The Spellbook that Azathoth can earn is Nuclear Chaos. It's a zero cost action. Each player rolls one

**[29:23]** die. The players with the highest roll gain that much Power. The players with the lowest roll gain that

**[29:29]** many Elder Signs. You may choose to add or subtract one to your die roll after seeing all results.

**[29:37]** Flip this Spellbook face down. Can't be used again this action phase. Flip it face up again during the

**[29:43]** gather Power phase. Wow, so this is a really cool great old one. Great introduction to independent

**[29:49]** great old ones. Starting with the combat, Azathoth possibly is rolling a lot of dice. Not only this,

**[29:56]** but it's going to take multiple hits to kill. Probably Azathoth has at least a couple of lives, if not more,

**[30:03]** like three or five lives before it actually gets killed for you. It can soak up those hits, and therefore

**[30:08]** I really like it as an addition to any fighting factions that can take advantage of moving it. So

**[30:14]** Big Cthulhu, Windwalker, Crawling Chaos, things like that. It can roll a significant amount of dice

**[30:20]** and prevent capture, so any engine faction is also going to enjoy this.

**[30:26]** That is the Azathoth expansion covered, I think, from top to bottom. I'll give you my closing thoughts.

**[30:33]** This expansion and other neutrals are a great way to spice up your games of Cthulhu Wars. As I said previously,

**[30:42]** Cthulhu Wars is a delicious cake, and many of these add-ons are just ways to make that cake even more

**[30:48]** decadent, maybe only at the expense of time. I really like this box as a good introduction to

**[30:55]** neutrals. It's got the great old one, and it's got the monsters and the Spellbooks, which don't appear

**[31:00]** anywhere else. Generally, neutrals, they're going to add time to the game, but also a lot of fun and a lot

**[31:07]** of chaos and a lot of unpredictability. So if that's something that you're looking for, these could be

**[31:12]** for you. I would say that neutrals are not perfectly balanced the way that I think the factions are

**[31:18]** relatively balanced, but that's kind of the point of them. They're supposed to be chaotic, they're

**[31:22]** supposed to be unbalanced and warping to the game. The best Cthulhu Wars players may always choose the

**[31:28]** quote-unquote optimal neutrals for their faction, but if you're playing with people that are that

**[31:33]** experienced that they would know that kind of thing, I think that's probably a good problem to have

**[31:37]** and you're probably playing pretty good games of Cthulhu Wars every time you get together.

**[31:42]** There's a note here on the independence cards that I agree with, so they recommend for your

**[31:47]** first game with independence, that'd be monsters or great old ones. For your first game of independence,

**[31:53]** recommend using one fewer than the number of players. So four-player game, three neutral units,

**[31:58]** whether those are monsters or great old ones or anything in between. Feel free to pick whatever

**[32:04]** you want. I've played games with many more neutrals than the number of players. That is very chaotic.

**[32:09]** It is a lot. It's not really feasible in real life, just having all the plastic right available to you,

**[32:15]** but if that's something you can do, definitely give it a go. One other way to choose neutrals that I

**[32:21]** want to try is having everybody secretly tell you which one they want to use before they're going to show up

**[32:27]** for the game before anyone picks their factions. That way you're going to give people the neutral

**[32:32]** that they want, or if someone goes the wrong time in the turn order, maybe somebody realizes that and

**[32:38]** steals it from them before they have a chance to buy it, things like that. That's a really fun

**[32:42]** interplay that can come up. Other ways you can use neutrals is just go for the flavor. So one example

**[32:49]** would be playing on Dreamlands and having both the Dreamland surface monsters and the underworld

**[32:55]** monsters available for purchase. Maybe you could even house rule that you need to be on the right

**[33:00]** level of the map to recruit, like say, an underworld Langspider you can only get in the underworld.

**[33:06]** That would be cool. I'd like to try that specific one out and I'll report back to you on how it went.

**[33:12]** Overall, I'd say I like neutrals. I definitely am not interested in them in every game because I do

**[33:18]** think they make the difference, as opposed to the High Priest. I do think neutrals make the difference of

**[33:23]** you're probably only going to play one game, maybe two games if you put them in, just because they do

**[33:28]** add significant overhead, significant rules that other players have to keep track of. If your players

**[33:34]** haven't used them many times, they might actually really be taking time to mull over when to buy them,

**[33:39]** when to fight with them, things like that. So keep that in mind. All that being said, I do think this

**[33:45]** expansion is worth trying. The different components may be not all at once, but in any combination.

**[33:50]** You should definitely try them. They are fun. You're going to get a lot of mileage out of them. If people do enjoy

**[33:55]** them, you'll be able to play them together, separately, in combination with other neutrals for multiple games.

**[34:01]** So neutrals just add to the replayability of Cthulhu Wars, which, as I've said before, you could play this game

**[34:07]** a million times, it wouldn't get boring. And with all the combinations of neutrals out there,

**[34:13]** you could just play this game infinity times and it would be great every time.

**[34:16]** Hopefully this guide's been useful to you. Hopefully you enjoyed. That's another episode of Opening the Way

**[34:22]** in the Books, so thank you so much for listening. Be sure to rate, review, and subscribe.

**[34:28]** And have a nice evening, have a nice day, have a nice morning, where it is that you are. Bye!
