## Transcript

**[00:00]** Beyond the zone of the 13 Faviolet Colossi lies Yoggoth, where dwell the denizens of many

**[00:05]** extraterrestrial realms. Yoggoth's black streets have known the tread of malformed paws and the

**[00:12]** touch of misshapen appendages, and unvisageable shapes creep along its lightless towers.

**[00:18]** But few of the creatures of the Rimworld are as feared as that survival from Yoggoth's youth,

**[00:24]** which remains in a pit beyond one of the cities. This survival few have seen, but the legend of

**[00:31]** the crustaceans tells of a city of green pyramids which hangs over a ledge far down in the dark.

**[00:37]** It's said that no mind can stand the sight of what occurs on that ledge at certain seasons.

**[00:54]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:06]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[01:11]** Hope you're doing well wherever you are. It's Saturday morning at the time of recording.

**[01:16]** I just got back from the grocery store. It seems like it's going to be a pretty nice day,

**[01:20]** so I'm going to record this and then take my dog Sunny on a nice long walk in the park before it gets too hot.

**[01:28]** For today's episode, we'll be doing another map discussion, this time on the Yoggoth map.

**[01:36]** Pretty sure Yoggoth got mentioned the first time in the H.P. Lovecraft story, Whisperer in Darkness.

**[01:42]** It's heavily implied to be the same as Pluto, so that's where we're at, somewhere out in the solar system.

**[01:48]** What I read at the beginning of the episode there was a little bit from the story The Mine on Yoggoth by Ramsay Campbell.

**[01:56]** More on him later. We definitely have some Ramsay Campbell-centric episodes coming down the pipe.

**[02:04]** We'll do a little bit of an overview of the map.

**[02:07]** We'll break down all the mechanics, and then lastly we'll go into some strategies for playing on Yoggoth

**[02:12]** and maybe some faction-specific interactions.

**[02:14]** Like most of the alternate maps in Cthulhu Wars, definitely this one introduces a bit more chaos,

**[02:22]** so again, if you want to be playing a more stable game, a more standard game,

**[02:27]** probably don't recommend playing on Yoggoth.

**[02:29]** It can be chaotic. I don't think quite as chaotic as the library and all the shenanigans going on there,

**[02:35]** but make no mistake, there is some crazy stuff that's going to happen on Yoggoth

**[02:38]** because of all the mechanics that we'll get into.

**[02:42]** This is another map that wraps around like Earth does, so no more split maps like the library or the Dreamlands.

**[02:50]** This one wraps around like Earth, but obviously is not on Earth, on Pluto, on Yoggoth.

**[02:56]** This map is defined by three, maybe four mechanics depending on how you count them.

**[03:05]** The laboratory, the slime seas, and the green pyramid.

**[03:10]** That fourth one would be the watcher, which I'll get into later.

**[03:13]** All of these mechanics benefit you by being in certain areas,

**[03:19]** and I would say all of these also kind of enhance some of the fundamental things that you want to do in Cthulhu Wars.

**[03:27]** You'll be able to get extra Power and possibly control more Gates through brain cylinders.

**[03:33]** That's a new type of Cultist brought to you through the magic of surgery.

**[03:36]** You can get some extra monsters to defend a cluster of Gates in an area called the Slime Sea.

**[03:44]** And the green pyramid that you heard about in the beginning is actually on this map.

**[03:48]** Gates on that green pyramid area will generate an additional Power during gather Power,

**[03:53]** but there is a catch.

**[03:54]** If you push your luck, you may end up waking up the watcher,

**[03:58]** who might ruin your plans and maybe also everybody else's.

**[04:01]** Let's move on to the first of the three mechanics on Yoggoth that would be the laboratory.

**[04:10]** On Tond, Yoggoth, and occasionally on Earth,

**[04:14]** immortality has been attained by an obscure process.

**[04:17]** The brain of the immortal is transplanted from body to body at 35-year intervals,

**[04:22]** this otherwise impossible operation being carried out using a chokal container

**[04:27]** in which the naked brain is placed between bodies.

**[04:29]** Tokal is a metal mined extensively on Yoggoth,

**[04:33]** but neither exists nor can be created on Earth.

**[04:38]** The first thing to discuss is the laboratory.

**[04:41]** It's an area in the northern part of the map around 12 o'clock,

**[04:45]** and it's going to enable you to create a new kind of Cultist.

**[04:49]** A player that controls a Gate in the laboratory area can perform the surgery action.

**[04:54]** It's a one-cost action if you control the laboratory Gate,

**[04:59]** eliminate up to four of your Cultists in play,

**[05:01]** and replace them with an equal number of brain cylinder tokens in your faction's color.

**[05:06]** If Opener of the Way is in play,

**[05:08]** Yoggoth can perform the surgery action when in the laboratory area.

**[05:12]** If a different faction controls a normal Gate in the lab,

**[05:16]** at the same time Yoggoth is there,

**[05:18]** both factions can perform surgery.

**[05:21]** I really love the way these look.

**[05:23]** It just looks like a cylinder on the ground.

**[05:25]** I can see a nice brain in there.

**[05:27]** Definitely recommend the Shining Trapezohedron pack if you can get it.

**[05:31]** Get the 3D brain cylinders.

**[05:33]** They're much, much cooler looking than the cardboard tokens that come with the map.

**[05:37]** You must place these brain cylinders in the same areas as the Cultists they replace.

**[05:43]** They can replace your Cultists on Gates,

**[05:45]** immediately retaking control of those Gates.

**[05:48]** You can also swap out Cultists that are not on the map but still in play,

**[05:53]** such as some of Cthulhu's Cultists while they're submerged,

**[05:55]** or Sleeper's Acolyte that might be on a cursed slumber Gate.

**[05:59]** So by doing surgery, we start getting up to 4 new Cultist brain cylinders.

**[06:08]** They're a new type of Cultists.

**[06:09]** They cannot be recruited normally,

**[06:11]** nor can they be placed on the map due to special abilities that place units,

**[06:15]** such as Yellow Signs Desecrate.

**[06:17]** Brain cylinders can't use the move action,

**[06:19]** but they may perform any other game action in addition to all Cultist functions.

**[06:24]** So that means they earn Power during Gather Power,

**[06:26]** they can create control and abandon Gates,

**[06:30]** and they also count as a unit in the area for the recruitment of Cultists.

**[06:36]** Brain cylinders can't move on their own.

**[06:38]** To move a brain cylinder, one of your other units must move with them.

**[06:43]** Your brain cylinders accompany your other units for free in a move action,

**[06:47]** and a single unit can carry multiple cylinders.

**[06:49]** You can also bring brain cylinders along using a movement-like ability,

**[06:53]** as long as that ability allows you to bring other non-specific units along.

**[06:59]** For example, you could use them with Submerge,

**[07:01]** but you couldn't use them with Screaming Dead,

**[07:03]** or Seek and Destroy, Necrophagy, Shriek of the Biaki,

**[07:06]** anything that mentions specific units.

**[07:09]** Something that modifies the move action,

**[07:11]** such as the Shantak's Horror Steed ability,

**[07:14]** would allow it to transport any number of brain cylinders,

**[07:17]** in addition to a Cultist.

**[07:18]** Since brain cylinders are considered Cultists,

**[07:22]** they benefit from any Spellbooks or abilities that affect Cultists.

**[07:25]** So, for example, Black Goat's Frenzy would provide them with one combat.

**[07:30]** They're not accolades, however,

**[07:32]** so to affect a brain cylinder,

**[07:34]** an ability must specify that it affects Cultists, or units.

**[07:40]** Brain cylinders have zero combat like all other Cultists,

**[07:43]** and for all game purposes, their cost is zero.

**[07:46]** Brain cylinders cannot be assigned pain results in battle.

**[07:51]** Because of this, they tend to be left behind in areas

**[07:53]** as their owners are driven away in battle.

**[07:57]** They're also immune to pain-like retreats,

**[08:00]** such as Windwalker's Howl,

**[08:01]** or pains inflicted by Opener's Dread Curse.

**[08:05]** Kills can still be assigned to them.

**[08:07]** Remember, kills must still be assigned before pain,

**[08:10]** so brain cylinders cannot help you avoid kills or eliminations in battle.

**[08:16]** One thing to keep in mind about pains that's important,

**[08:18]** brain cylinders do not prevent units from being pained into their areas in a battle.

**[08:24]** Brain cylinders by themselves cannot surround,

**[08:26]** and therefore eliminate enemy units.

**[08:29]** So don't worry if Black Goat has brain cylinders everywhere,

**[08:32]** that doesn't mean that you're going to get more eliminations by being surrounded.

**[08:35]** Capturing a brain cylinder is like capturing any other Cultist,

**[08:41]** and follows the same rules.

**[08:43]** However, when a cylinder is captured,

**[08:45]** you may choose instead to convert it into a cylinder of your own faction's color,

**[08:50]** leaving it on the map.

**[08:52]** Each faction has a hard limit of four cylinders,

**[08:55]** so if you already have four on the map,

**[08:57]** and capture a fifth, you can't convert it.

**[08:58]** It must be placed on your faction card to be sacrificed in the next gather Power phase,

**[09:03]** along with the other Cultists you may have captured.

**[09:08]** Okay, that was a lot of rules to describe surgery and brain cylinders,

**[09:12]** but we'll break it down a little bit for you and what the implications are.

**[09:17]** Basically, if you can do the surgery,

**[09:19]** you've effectively increased your total Cultist count from 6 to 10.

**[09:24]** That's something that's going to be very fundamentally Powerful in Cthulhu Wars.

**[09:29]** Think about this, you have the potential to control up to 10 Gates

**[09:32]** between your 6 Cultists and now your 4 brain cylinders.

**[09:36]** I'm not saying that's going to happen for you.

**[09:38]** If it does, the game is certainly over and you've won.

**[09:42]** But just the potential to do that is a big deal.

**[09:46]** Even if you don't have Gates in excess of 6,

**[09:49]** you just have more Cultists hanging around

**[09:51]** that you can distribute between your controlled Gates.

**[09:54]** That's going to make it harder to lose control of them,

**[09:57]** and that's a really nice thing to have.

**[10:00]** Unfortunately, these aren't going to help you protect your great old ones

**[10:03]** the way that your normal acolytes can,

**[10:05]** but they are still cheap to move around, so that's important.

**[10:11]** On capturing brain cylinders versus converting them,

**[10:15]** if there's one brain cylinder controlling a Gate, for example,

**[10:19]** no other Cultists around,

**[10:21]** and you also don't have all of your brain cylinders on the map,

**[10:24]** probably better to convert because you will have netted one Cultist doing that,

**[10:30]** and you will have saved a Power by not having to recruit a Cultist in the area,

**[10:36]** if that makes sense.

**[10:37]** If you capture a normal acolyte off a Gate,

**[10:39]** you may have to move one in on your end or recruit one,

**[10:42]** so converting will save you one Power there.

**[10:47]** The potential return on having a cylinder for a few gather Powers

**[10:51]** I think does make converting a little bit more valuable than capturing,

**[10:56]** though I'm sure there's going to be exceptions.

**[10:57]** I'm not trying to make a full exhaustive list of when to do either one of those things.

**[11:02]** All factions are going to benefit from this generally strong area,

**[11:09]** but I have some callouts in particular that I really like.

**[11:12]** Black Goat I think is extremely strong on Yoggoth because of this area.

**[11:17]** You're going to get four additional Cultists,

**[11:20]** that's plus four to Shub's Combat potentially,

**[11:23]** and Black Goat already could control up to nine Gates from the Dark Young and Red Sign.

**[11:29]** If you perform surgery, your Gate potential is now up to 13 Gates.

**[11:34]** I've never seen that happen.

**[11:35]** I've never even gotten close to 10 Gates,

**[11:37]** but I can dream and maybe one day it will happen.

**[11:41]** Somebody out there.

**[11:42]** Hopefully me.

**[11:44]** Another nice one would be Demon Sultan.

**[11:47]** If you convert four of your acolytes into cylinders,

**[11:50]** that's potentially four more times you can use Psychosis,

**[11:54]** which is cool, but if your Cultists are in random locations on the map,

**[11:58]** it might not be super useful to turn them into cylinders,

**[12:01]** I leave that up to you.

**[12:03]** You probably are hungry enough for the Power anyway.

**[12:07]** Lastly, for Cthulhu, if you do surgery,

**[12:10]** you're putting four of your acolytes potentially back into your pool.

**[12:14]** That's just more fodder for Dreams.

**[12:17]** Expanding upon that Rain cycle that you can do with Cthulhu

**[12:21]** with Deep Ones, Acolytes, Dreams,

**[12:23]** and now the brain cylinder is making it a little bit easier

**[12:26]** for you to dreams people if you need to.

**[12:32]** Let's move on to our second mechanic on this map,

**[12:36]** and that would be the Slime Seas.

**[12:40]** This is a cluster of areas on the left side of the map,

**[12:44]** and there is one special area called the Slime Sea Overlook,

**[12:48]** and it is surrounded by,

**[12:51]** depending on the player count that you have on the map,

**[12:55]** two or three areas.

**[12:58]** Those are the different Slime Seas.

**[13:02]** Faction that controls a Gate on the Slime Sea Overlook

**[13:06]** takes a loyalty card

**[13:08]** and is now allowed to perform a new

**[13:10]** Call Slime Mold action.

**[13:12]** If Opener of the Way is in play,

**[13:15]** Yogg-Sototh can perform the Call Slime Mold action

**[13:18]** by being in the Slime Sea Overlook.

**[13:21]** However, if there's also a normal Gate in the Overlook

**[13:24]** and it's controlled by a different faction,

**[13:27]** then Yogg cannot perform this action.

**[13:29]** Only one faction may perform Call Slime Mold action,

**[13:33]** and a normal Gate in the Overlook

**[13:35]** takes precedence over Yogg.

**[13:38]** Call Slime Mold is a one or zero cost action.

**[13:42]** If you control a Gate on the Slime Sea Overlook,

**[13:45]** place a Slime Mold into any Slime Sea area.

**[13:49]** If there's no Slimes in play, this costs zero.

**[13:52]** If at least one Slime is in play, this costs one.

**[13:56]** Slimes are monsters, but they cannot be summoned.

**[13:59]** They can only be brought into play via this action.

**[14:01]** Slime Mold's have a combat of two and no inherent abilities.

**[14:09]** They look pretty gross, just kind of like a pile of ooze,

**[14:13]** but they could have some mouths here,

**[14:16]** I'm not really sure, but it's very unsettling to look at them.

**[14:21]** Slimes cannot use a move action to go to the Slime Sea Overlook,

**[14:24]** but they may be paying there or arrive there by other means,

**[14:28]** such as Submerge or Avatar from Black Goat.

**[14:33]** The faction that controls a Gate in the Slime Sea Overlook controls all Slime Molds.

**[14:39]** If this Gate becomes controlled by another faction,

**[14:42]** all Slime Molds in play change their allegiance to the Gate's new controller.

**[14:46]** If the Gate's abandoned, the Slime Molds become uncontrolled.

**[14:51]** It is possible to declare battle against uncontrolled Slime Molds

**[14:55]** without affecting any other faction.

**[14:58]** The Slime Molds do fight back,

**[14:59]** they roll dice for themselves,

**[15:01]** that's two combat per Slime,

**[15:03]** and they mark losses normally.

**[15:06]** If an uncontrolled Slime Mold is pained or retreated,

**[15:10]** and Madness is not in effect,

**[15:12]** their attacker chooses the area to which they're pained,

**[15:15]** following the normal pain rules.

**[15:17]** Uncontrolled Slime Molds can also be affected by other abilities

**[15:21]** that target monsters or units.

**[15:23]** So Capture Monster, for example,

**[15:25]** or Devour, or Avatar,

**[15:28]** can be used on uncontrolled Slime Molds.

**[15:31]** Special rules carve out for Black Goat.

**[15:34]** Although we're not taking the summon monster action,

**[15:37]** we're only calling, quote-unquote calling, Slime Molds.

**[15:41]** Black Goat's Fertility Cult will still allow you to call

**[15:43]** as many Slime Molds as you want,

**[15:45]** in conjunction with summoning other monsters.

**[15:48]** They still must appear in the Slime Sea area,

**[15:51]** even when Fertility Cult is being used to create them.

**[15:56]** So count it, that's two out of three areas on this map

**[15:59]** that Black Goat gets a little bit of a special benefit from.

**[16:02]** Amazing.

**[16:04]** Again, a lot of rules,

**[16:06]** but let's break this down a little bit.

**[16:07]** One of the main reasons being spread thin in Cthulhu Wars

**[16:12]** is not always ideal

**[16:13]** is because you kind of have like a limited amount of plastic

**[16:17]** that you can put on the board for your faction.

**[16:19]** I'm talking about Cultists, of course,

**[16:20]** but monsters to defend your Cultist is another thing.

**[16:24]** You may be like concentrating your forces

**[16:26]** in a couple different areas

**[16:27]** that makes it a little bit more difficult

**[16:29]** to be like everywhere at once.

**[16:30]** I see the Slime Sea Overlook

**[16:35]** as kind of like the monster equivalent to the Laboratory,

**[16:38]** since if you control that special Gate,

**[16:41]** it's going to kind of expand the monsters

**[16:43]** that you have access to with a few strings attached.

**[16:47]** The slimes as a monster are a pretty good rate,

**[16:50]** so think like Demon Salt and Larva,

**[16:52]** one cost, two combat most of the time.

**[16:54]** That's pretty nice.

**[16:55]** Having the extra dice is going to allow you to hold on

**[16:58]** to hopefully one or more areas around the Slime Sea.

**[17:03]** The only way to reach the Overlook

**[17:05]** is by going through the Slime Sea,

**[17:07]** so if you happen to really want to prioritize

**[17:11]** the Slime Sea Overlook and the surrounding areas,

**[17:14]** you can really kind of hunker down

**[17:16]** and make a fortress there.

**[17:18]** Depending on which side of the board you're playing with,

**[17:20]** you've got, you know, the Overlook

**[17:22]** and potentially two or three other sea areas

**[17:25]** that you could have Gates in.

**[17:26]** You can have extra monsters there to hold it all down.

**[17:30]** If you can hold on to three or four Gates

**[17:32]** in an action phase, you're doing pretty well,

**[17:35]** so that's definitely one reason to like

**[17:36]** go into this area and post up,

**[17:39]** try to like maintain control the entire game.

**[17:44]** That central Overlook area is valuable,

**[17:47]** so it's going to be fought over.

**[17:49]** I would be very careful about the more mobile factions

**[17:53]** like Crawling Chaos or Ancients with Dematerialize

**[17:57]** or Opener of Course with Beyond One

**[17:59]** that can like easily get into your area

**[18:02]** and cause trouble for you.

**[18:04]** They only really need to take that Slime Sea Overlook from you,

**[18:09]** so I would be like defending that

**[18:11]** with more units if possible.

**[18:13]** If they do take it from you,

**[18:16]** those Slimes that you might have in the sea

**[18:18]** at your other Gates are immediately switching teams,

**[18:20]** so keep that in mind.

**[18:22]** It might be nice to have another monster

**[18:23]** if that happens in those sea areas,

**[18:27]** just in case,

**[18:28]** so that you don't automatically have your Cultists

**[18:30]** exposed to getting captured by the Slimes.

**[18:32]** Let's go on to the last of the Yoggoth mechanics.

**[18:39]** That would be the Green Pyramid.

**[18:43]** The Green Pyramid is on the eastern side of the map

**[18:46]** and it's going to contain either two or four areas

**[18:49]** depending on whether you're playing

**[18:51]** with the three-player side of the map

**[18:52]** or the five-player side of the map.

**[18:55]** You've got the slopes of the pyramid as one area

**[18:59]** and you've got the Watcher's Postern at the top of the pyramid.

**[19:04]** These areas are all marked.

**[19:06]** One mark in each area is the die roll result

**[19:09]** on which the Watcher appears.

**[19:11]** More on that in a second.

**[19:12]** The other mark is a symbol indicating

**[19:15]** that controlled Gates on the pyramid

**[19:16]** earn their controller one additional Power

**[19:19]** during the gather Power phase.

**[19:22]** So that means controlled Gates in the Green Pyramid area

**[19:25]** including the Watcher Postern on top

**[19:28]** produce three Power and gather Power

**[19:30]** instead of just two.

**[19:32]** I know you're wondering

**[19:33]** since we've mentioned it every other time

**[19:35]** yes, Yogg being in one of those pyramid areas

**[19:39]** is going to produce three Power instead of just two.

**[19:42]** Abandoned Gates on the Green Pyramid

**[19:44]** still produce only one Power for all factions.

**[19:48]** Like I said in the overview

**[19:50]** the pyramids are great

**[19:52]** they provide you extra Power, amazing

**[19:54]** but there is a big risk here

**[19:56]** and that is the Watcher.

**[19:58]** The Watcher of the Green Pyramid

**[20:00]** is a hideous abnormality

**[20:01]** a monstrous fellow to the Great Old Ones.

**[20:04]** It dwells in the abysses beneath the Green Pyramid.

**[20:08]** Activity on Yoggoth

**[20:09]** periodically brings forth the Watcher

**[20:11]** to ravage and destroy the board.

**[20:16]** Both the Watcher is very disgusting looking

**[20:18]** it looks like a

**[20:20]** some kind of a bug crossed with a bat.

**[20:22]** It kind of reminds me of like a cockroach

**[20:25]** even worse it reminds me of a silverfish

**[20:28]** I don't know if you know those

**[20:29]** they're like extremely fast and disgusting

**[20:31]** centipede looking things

**[20:33]** and at least where I am in Pennsylvania

**[20:35]** maybe it's even giving me a little bit of

**[20:37]** spotted lanternfly vibes.

**[20:40]** If you don't know what those are

**[20:41]** hopefully you never see one

**[20:42]** they're an invasive species

**[20:43]** they're very annoying

**[20:44]** you want to kill them if you can

**[20:47]** but they're actually very good at dodging

**[20:49]** out of the way of a foot

**[20:51]** that's coming to kill them.

**[20:53]** Anyway.

**[20:54]** During the setup for Yoggoth

**[20:56]** you're going to put a

**[20:58]** Watcher marker on the Doom Track

**[21:00]** at 12 Doom

**[21:02]** and it's going to be on its sleeping side.

**[21:05]** In the Doom phase

**[21:07]** the Watcher might awaken.

**[21:09]** At the end of the Doom phase

**[21:10]** after all players have had a chance

**[21:12]** to perform a ritual

**[21:13]** and if there's a controlled Gate

**[21:15]** in any Green Pyramid area

**[21:17]** roll a die.

**[21:18]** If the result equals the number

**[21:20]** printed on an area with a controlled Gate

**[21:22]** the Watcher awakens.

**[21:25]** Flip the Watcher token

**[21:26]** to the lit up awakened side

**[21:28]** and place its figure

**[21:29]** on the Watcher postern

**[21:31]** regardless of the number

**[21:33]** that gets rolled.

**[21:35]** Yoggothoth's presence

**[21:36]** in a Green Pyramid area

**[21:37]** counts for awakening the Watcher

**[21:39]** even if a normal Gate

**[21:40]** is not controlled in the same area.

**[21:43]** Should any player's Doom marker

**[21:45]** pass over the Dark Watcher token

**[21:47]** flip it to the Light Awakened side.

**[21:51]** So when the first player

**[21:52]** reaches or exceeds 12 Doom

**[21:53]** the Watcher is going to awaken

**[21:55]** automatically

**[21:56]** if it's not already awake.

**[21:58]** If a player reaches 12 Doom

**[22:00]** during the Action phase

**[22:02]** for like revealing Elder Signs

**[22:04]** or whatever

**[22:04]** the Watcher is not going to awaken

**[22:06]** until the following Doom phase.

**[22:07]** The Watcher is going to

**[22:11]** decay over time.

**[22:13]** If the Watcher is already awake

**[22:15]** before the Doom phase begins

**[22:16]** roll a die

**[22:17]** and lower the Watcher token's

**[22:19]** position on the Doom Track

**[22:20]** by that many spaces.

**[22:22]** If it decays to zero

**[22:23]** it's killed

**[22:24]** and you remove it from the map.

**[22:26]** So the Watcher is going to

**[22:28]** gradually dwindle

**[22:29]** in combat

**[22:30]** and eventually vanish

**[22:31]** even if nobody ends up

**[22:33]** trying to kill it in battle.

**[22:34]** Don't decay the Watcher

**[22:37]** on the Doom phase

**[22:38]** where it awakens

**[22:39]** and never reawaken the Watcher

**[22:41]** in the same Doom phase

**[22:42]** that it decays to zero

**[22:44]** and gets killed.

**[22:47]** After the Doom phase

**[22:49]** if the Watcher is awake

**[22:51]** the Watcher is going to attack.

**[22:53]** If the Watcher is awake

**[22:55]** at the start of the Action phase

**[22:56]** it will attack.

**[22:57]** This occurs before

**[22:58]** the first player takes an action.

**[23:01]** The Watcher is going to attack

**[23:03]** once per player.

**[23:05]** The first player

**[23:06]** controls its first attack

**[23:07]** followed by the next player

**[23:09]** and so forth in turn order

**[23:11]** until each player

**[23:12]** has had a chance to control it once

**[23:14]** or it's been destroyed.

**[23:16]** So how do we control

**[23:18]** the Watcher's attacks?

**[23:20]** On each attack

**[23:21]** the controlling player

**[23:22]** must move the Watcher

**[23:23]** into an adjacent area

**[23:24]** of their choice

**[23:25]** that contains units

**[23:27]** belonging to any faction.

**[23:29]** If no player's units

**[23:30]** are in an adjacent area

**[23:31]** the Watcher may be teleported

**[23:33]** to any area

**[23:34]** containing any player's units.

**[23:37]** The Watcher can never remain

**[23:38]** in the same area.

**[23:40]** A player may return the Watcher

**[23:42]** to attack an area

**[23:43]** moved from earlier

**[23:44]** in the same Action phase.

**[23:46]** Since the Watcher

**[23:47]** first awakens

**[23:48]** on the Postern

**[23:49]** it must move

**[23:50]** into an adjacent area

**[23:51]** with units.

**[23:52]** You might feel safe

**[23:53]** having a Gate

**[23:54]** on the Postern itself

**[23:56]** but just know

**[23:57]** that it can come back

**[23:58]** for seconds

**[23:59]** on another attack.

**[24:02]** Immediately after moving

**[24:03]** the Watcher initiates

**[24:04]** a battle with

**[24:05]** combat dice

**[24:06]** equal to the Watcher

**[24:07]** token's position

**[24:08]** so that's 12 dice initially.

**[24:10]** It attacks each faction

**[24:11]** in the area

**[24:12]** separately and independently

**[24:13]** in the order chosen

**[24:15]** by the Watcher's controller

**[24:16]** at the time.

**[24:18]** The defending faction

**[24:19]** rolls combat dice

**[24:20]** against the Watcher

**[24:21]** as normal.

**[24:22]** Each kill roll

**[24:23]** drops the Watcher token

**[24:24]** down one point

**[24:25]** on the Doom Track.

**[24:26]** The Watcher

**[24:27]** is immune to all pains.

**[24:28]** Once the first

**[24:31]** Watcher attack

**[24:31]** has been completed

**[24:32]** the second player

**[24:33]** then takes control

**[24:34]** of the Watcher

**[24:35]** for the next attack

**[24:36]** which includes

**[24:37]** both a move

**[24:38]** and a battle.

**[24:39]** This continues

**[24:40]** until all players

**[24:40]** have controlled

**[24:41]** the Watcher once

**[24:42]** or until it's

**[24:43]** been destroyed.

**[24:45]** At that point

**[24:45]** the first player

**[24:46]** takes their own

**[24:47]** action as normal

**[24:48]** in the Action phase.

**[24:50]** During the rest

**[24:51]** of the Action phase

**[24:52]** any player

**[24:52]** may initiate a battle

**[24:53]** against the Watcher.

**[24:55]** It will roll

**[24:55]** its own combat dice

**[24:56]** and ignore the pains

**[24:57]** as normal.

**[24:59]** When the Watcher's token

**[25:00]** drops to 0

**[25:01]** on the Doom Track

**[25:02]** even if it reaches 0

**[25:03]** due to Watcher decay

**[25:04]** in the Doom phase

**[25:05]** its figures

**[25:06]** remove from the board

**[25:07]** and the Watcher tokens

**[25:08]** flip back

**[25:09]** to the dark sleeping side.

**[25:11]** That token's placed

**[25:13]** back at 12

**[25:13]** on the Doom Track.

**[25:15]** The Watcher will awaken

**[25:16]** again if another

**[25:17]** player's Doom marker

**[25:19]** reaches 12

**[25:20]** or via the die roll

**[25:22]** if there's Gates

**[25:23]** on the pyramid.

**[25:25]** If all players

**[25:26]** Doom have already

**[25:27]** reached or exceeded

**[25:28]** 12 the Watcher's

**[25:29]** only going to

**[25:30]** reawaken via rolling

**[25:32]** dice if there are

**[25:33]** Gates on the pyramid.

**[25:34]** The Watcher is considered

**[25:38]** to be a great old one.

**[25:40]** While Spellbooks

**[25:40]** and abilities

**[25:41]** can be used

**[25:42]** in battle against it

**[25:43]** they may only

**[25:43]** affect your own units.

**[25:45]** So for example

**[25:46]** that means

**[25:46]** you can't

**[25:47]** howl the Watcher

**[25:48]** away

**[25:49]** and demand

**[25:49]** sacrifices

**[25:50]** not going to

**[25:51]** give you an Elder Sign

**[25:53]** things like that.

**[25:54]** The Watcher is

**[25:55]** considered to

**[25:56]** cause 0 Power

**[25:57]** it has no

**[25:57]** Spellbooks

**[25:58]** or Doom

**[25:58]** and it's

**[25:59]** considered

**[26:00]** for all purposes

**[26:01]** to have no

**[26:01]** Power of its own

**[26:02]** or any

**[26:03]** normal features

**[26:04]** of a faction

**[26:05]** such as calculating

**[26:06]** the combat of

**[26:07]** Sithagua

**[26:08]** Ithiqua

**[26:08]** Norlathotep

**[26:09]** etc.

**[26:11]** As a great old one

**[26:12]** however

**[26:13]** the Watcher

**[26:14]** can provide

**[26:14]** Norlathotep

**[26:15]** with two Elder Signs

**[26:16]** for scoring a kill

**[26:17]** against it.

**[26:18]** It's immune

**[26:19]** to pains though

**[26:20]** so Norlathotep

**[26:21]** must actually

**[26:22]** score a kill

**[26:23]** and multiple

**[26:24]** pains against

**[26:25]** the Watcher

**[26:25]** are not going

**[26:26]** to provide

**[26:27]** crawling chaos

**[26:27]** with additional

**[26:28]** Elder Signs.

**[26:28]** That was also

**[26:32]** a lot of rules

**[26:33]** the most rules

**[26:33]** so far

**[26:34]** so hopefully

**[26:35]** you're still

**[26:35]** with me

**[26:35]** I will break

**[26:36]** this down

**[26:37]** a little bit.

**[26:38]** Awakening the

**[26:39]** Watcher

**[26:39]** the first time

**[26:40]** there's either

**[26:41]** going to be

**[26:41]** dice rolled

**[26:42]** because there's

**[26:43]** Gates on the

**[26:43]** pyramid somewhere

**[26:44]** or somebody

**[26:45]** is going to

**[26:46]** hit 12 Doom

**[26:46]** in which case

**[26:47]** the Watcher

**[26:48]** is going to

**[26:48]** wake up

**[26:49]** regardless.

**[26:51]** The Watcher

**[26:52]** is rolling

**[26:53]** 12 combat

**[26:54]** dice initially

**[26:54]** so I would

**[26:55]** say brace

**[26:56]** for impact

**[26:57]** if you

**[26:57]** see that

**[26:58]** there's Gates

**[26:59]** on the

**[26:59]** pyramid

**[26:59]** if you

**[27:00]** see somebody

**[27:01]** is getting

**[27:01]** close to

**[27:02]** 12 Doom

**[27:02]** batten down

**[27:03]** the hatches

**[27:04]** be prepared

**[27:05]** to get

**[27:05]** punched hard

**[27:06]** even if

**[27:07]** you're not

**[27:07]** nearby

**[27:07]** because if

**[27:09]** there aren't

**[27:09]** adjacent areas

**[27:10]** for the Watcher

**[27:10]** to move into

**[27:11]** it can just

**[27:12]** teleport over

**[27:13]** to you.

**[27:15]** A healthy

**[27:16]** Watcher

**[27:16]** that's rolling

**[27:17]** 10 or 12

**[27:18]** dice is

**[27:19]** pretty good

**[27:20]** at killing

**[27:20]** or isolating

**[27:21]** great old ones

**[27:22]** so be careful

**[27:24]** about that

**[27:24]** if you are

**[27:25]** a faction

**[27:26]** with multiple

**[27:26]** great old ones

**[27:27]** or take

**[27:28]** advantage of

**[27:29]** that by

**[27:29]** talking with

**[27:30]** the other

**[27:30]** players

**[27:31]** maybe you

**[27:32]** can help

**[27:32]** them isolate

**[27:34]** an important

**[27:35]** great old one

**[27:35]** that needs

**[27:35]** to be killed.

**[27:38]** A weaker

**[27:38]** Watcher

**[27:39]** not rolling

**[27:40]** as many

**[27:40]** dice might

**[27:41]** be better

**[27:42]** used to

**[27:43]** move and

**[27:44]** kill and

**[27:45]** pain out

**[27:45]** a particular

**[27:46]** Gated area

**[27:47]** that's not

**[27:47]** well defended

**[27:48]** instead of a

**[27:49]** big ball

**[27:50]** where it's not

**[27:50]** going to end up

**[27:51]** rolling a kill

**[27:51]** on an important

**[27:53]** unit like a

**[27:53]** great old one.

**[27:56]** Remember

**[27:57]** if there's

**[27:57]** two factions

**[27:58]** in the same

**[27:58]** area that you

**[27:59]** move the

**[27:59]** Watcher into

**[28:00]** it can attack

**[28:01]** both.

**[28:02]** I'd probably

**[28:03]** be attacking

**[28:03]** the quote unquote

**[28:04]** stronger player

**[28:05]** first who

**[28:06]** has a great

**[28:07]** old one there

**[28:07]** somebody who's

**[28:08]** in the lead

**[28:08]** and then save

**[28:09]** the weaker

**[28:09]** hit with less

**[28:10]** dice for

**[28:11]** the other

**[28:11]** player there

**[28:12]** maybe you

**[28:13]** are in an

**[28:13]** alliance with

**[28:14]** them or

**[28:14]** something.

**[28:17]** Last thing

**[28:17]** after the

**[28:18]** Watcher dies

**[28:19]** for the first

**[28:20]** time if

**[28:20]** there's no

**[28:21]** more Gates

**[28:21]** on the

**[28:21]** pyramid

**[28:22]** and everyone's

**[28:23]** already above

**[28:24]** 12 doom

**[28:24]** you are safe

**[28:26]** because the

**[28:26]** Watcher is

**[28:27]** only going to

**[28:27]** awaken again

**[28:28]** by seeing a

**[28:29]** Gated pyramid

**[28:30]** area and

**[28:31]** rolling dice

**[28:32]** to come back.

**[28:34]** So all the

**[28:35]** normal Gate

**[28:35]** moving shenanigans

**[28:37]** apply to the

**[28:38]** pyramid for

**[28:39]** sure.

**[28:41]** Beyond One

**[28:41]** can move Gates

**[28:42]** in and out of

**[28:43]** the pyramid

**[28:43]** area,

**[28:44]** Animate Matter

**[28:45]** from Demon

**[28:46]** Sultan can

**[28:46]** potentially move

**[28:47]** chaos Gates

**[28:48]** and destroy

**[28:48]** Gates in the

**[28:49]** pyramid area

**[28:50]** importantly,

**[28:51]** and Sleeper

**[28:52]** with Cursed

**[28:52]** Slumber can

**[28:53]** also potentially

**[28:54]** place Gates

**[28:55]** on the

**[28:55]** pyramid or

**[28:56]** take them

**[28:56]** away later.

**[28:58]** Keep those

**[28:59]** factions in

**[28:59]** mind when

**[29:00]** you're thinking

**[29:00]** about the

**[29:00]** pyramid.

**[29:04]** I think

**[29:05]** those are

**[29:05]** all of the

**[29:06]** mechanics broken

**[29:07]** down.

**[29:08]** The best I'm

**[29:08]** able, sorry

**[29:09]** there's a lot

**[29:10]** of rules there.

**[29:11]** We can move

**[29:11]** on to some

**[29:12]** strategies for

**[29:13]** playing on

**[29:13]** Yagoth.

**[29:15]** First one,

**[29:16]** pretty obvious,

**[29:18]** all three of

**[29:18]** these mechanics,

**[29:19]** the lab,

**[29:20]** the pyramid,

**[29:20]** the slime sea

**[29:21]** overlook are

**[29:21]** really strong,

**[29:22]** so I would

**[29:23]** be trying to

**[29:24]** be the one

**[29:25]** to take

**[29:25]** advantage of

**[29:26]** at least one

**[29:26]** of those for

**[29:27]** the duration

**[29:27]** of the game.

**[29:29]** Personally, I

**[29:30]** really like the

**[29:31]** laboratory, not

**[29:32]** only because I'm

**[29:33]** a black goat

**[29:33]** main, but it's

**[29:34]** just the easiest

**[29:35]** one.

**[29:36]** You don't

**[29:36]** really have any

**[29:37]** consequences for

**[29:38]** losing control of

**[29:40]** the laboratory

**[29:40]** later.

**[29:41]** If you can

**[29:41]** manage to get

**[29:42]** the surgery

**[29:43]** action off one

**[29:43]** time, you can

**[29:45]** feel free to

**[29:45]** leave and, you

**[29:46]** know, take care

**[29:47]** of your brain

**[29:48]** cylinders, but

**[29:49]** there's not

**[29:49]** really a penalty

**[29:50]** for losing control

**[29:51]** of the lab

**[29:52]** later, the way

**[29:53]** that there are

**[29:53]** with the slime

**[29:54]** sea and risks

**[29:55]** with the pyramids.

**[29:58]** Trying to be

**[30:00]** greedy and, you

**[30:01]** know, maybe be in

**[30:02]** the slime sea and

**[30:03]** the lab and or

**[30:04]** the pyramids, it's

**[30:06]** going to be

**[30:06]** difficult, but it's

**[30:07]** not impossible.

**[30:08]** If you are able

**[30:08]** to pull it off,

**[30:09]** you're probably

**[30:10]** really pulling

**[30:10]** ahead of the

**[30:11]** other players,

**[30:12]** and they should

**[30:13]** probably be

**[30:13]** discussing your

**[30:14]** demise because

**[30:15]** you're going to

**[30:16]** be probably

**[30:16]** dominating the

**[30:17]** game with more

**[30:18]** ocCultists and

**[30:19]** more Gates with

**[30:20]** more monsters to

**[30:21]** watch over them

**[30:22]** if you're in

**[30:22]** the slime sea.

**[30:25]** One thing you

**[30:26]** can do, the

**[30:27]** counterintuitive

**[30:27]** strategy, of

**[30:28]** course, playing a

**[30:29]** normal game, not

**[30:30]** caring about any

**[30:31]** of these areas is

**[30:32]** also a possibility.

**[30:34]** You can do this,

**[30:35]** but I'd say it's

**[30:35]** hard to ignore

**[30:36]** these areas.

**[30:37]** They're just so

**[30:37]** fundamentally

**[30:38]** Powerful, and

**[30:39]** you're definitely

**[30:39]** going to be at a

**[30:40]** disadvantage trying

**[30:41]** to fight against

**[30:42]** extra Power from

**[30:43]** people, extra

**[30:44]** monsters in the

**[30:45]** slime sea, extra

**[30:46]** Cultists that are

**[30:48]** going to make it

**[30:48]** more difficult for

**[30:49]** you to steal

**[30:50]** Gates from

**[30:51]** people.

**[30:53]** Like all the

**[30:54]** alternate maps,

**[30:55]** lots of fun for

**[30:56]** openers specifically

**[30:58]** being more

**[30:58]** dangerous, moving

**[31:00]** Gates into or

**[31:01]** out of these

**[31:01]** special areas, or

**[31:03]** just Yogg

**[31:04]** specifically, is

**[31:05]** going to give you

**[31:06]** a lot of

**[31:06]** flexibility.

**[31:08]** With the

**[31:08]** Watcher, you

**[31:09]** might even be

**[31:10]** interested in

**[31:11]** fighting yourself

**[31:11]** as the opener

**[31:12]** for million

**[31:13]** favored ones

**[31:14]** purposes.

**[31:15]** Upgrading a

**[31:16]** bunch of units

**[31:16]** at the right

**[31:17]** time can be

**[31:17]** pretty nice.

**[31:19]** Demon Sultan

**[31:21]** in specific with

**[31:22]** the pyramids might

**[31:23]** really like to

**[31:24]** cling to the

**[31:24]** pyramid.

**[31:25]** The Chaos

**[31:25]** Gates can be

**[31:26]** built for

**[31:27]** really cheaply,

**[31:28]** possibly one

**[31:29]** Power.

**[31:30]** It's very easy

**[31:31]** to psychosis into

**[31:32]** those areas.

**[31:34]** If you can

**[31:34]** ever get to

**[31:35]** Avatar Synthesis

**[31:36]** and have the

**[31:37]** Cosmic Ruler

**[31:38]** ability, you

**[31:39]** might also be in

**[31:39]** a good spot to

**[31:40]** not even care too

**[31:41]** much about the

**[31:42]** Watcher and

**[31:43]** just tank a

**[31:44]** battle and take

**[31:45]** a kill by

**[31:45]** killing your

**[31:47]** Avatar Thesis

**[31:48]** that might cost

**[31:48]** you one or

**[31:49]** zero Power to

**[31:50]** awaken later.

**[31:54]** Defensive

**[31:54]** factions like

**[31:55]** the Cho's, you

**[31:56]** might really like

**[31:57]** the Slime Sea

**[31:58]** areas if you

**[31:58]** can manage to

**[31:59]** get onto that

**[32:00]** Overlook just

**[32:01]** because you're

**[32:01]** going to have

**[32:01]** the extra bodies

**[32:02]** from the

**[32:03]** Slimes and

**[32:04]** the extra

**[32:04]** combat dice.

**[32:06]** I would be

**[32:07]** staying away from

**[32:08]** the pyramid if

**[32:08]** possible because

**[32:10]** you just don't

**[32:10]** want to be

**[32:11]** punched by a

**[32:11]** really early

**[32:12]** Watcher when

**[32:13]** you're not ready

**[32:14]** for it.

**[32:15]** Like a yellow

**[32:16]** sign is not

**[32:16]** going to enjoy

**[32:17]** getting punched

**[32:18]** by 12 dice

**[32:19]** Watcher so

**[32:20]** if you're not

**[32:21]** good at fighting

**[32:21]** combat, if you're

**[32:22]** not good at

**[32:23]** assembling a

**[32:24]** big ball of

**[32:24]** units, be very

**[32:26]** very careful

**[32:26]** about the

**[32:27]** pyramid.

**[32:30]** Closing thoughts

**[32:31]** on the map,

**[32:33]** I think this

**[32:33]** one's very fun,

**[32:34]** it gets across

**[32:35]** the like alien

**[32:36]** off-world vibe

**[32:38]** pretty well I

**[32:39]** would say.

**[32:39]** All these

**[32:40]** mechanics are

**[32:40]** very strange

**[32:41]** but they do

**[32:42]** make for

**[32:43]** exciting and

**[32:44]** Powerful gameplay.

**[32:45]** I think they're

**[32:46]** like less

**[32:47]** swingy than

**[32:47]** the library

**[32:48]** tomes but

**[32:49]** not by much.

**[32:51]** You can see

**[32:51]** some really

**[32:52]** crazy stuff

**[32:52]** happen on

**[32:53]** this map.

**[32:54]** A lot of

**[32:55]** slugfests with

**[32:56]** the Watcher can

**[32:57]** really change the

**[32:59]** course of the

**[32:59]** game.

**[33:00]** The leader

**[33:00]** might get hit

**[33:02]** really hard by

**[33:02]** the Watcher at

**[33:03]** some point and

**[33:04]** lose everything

**[33:05]** and all of a

**[33:06]** sudden the Power

**[33:07]** dynamic has been

**[33:08]** totally flipped and

**[33:09]** now other

**[33:10]** factions are in

**[33:11]** position to go

**[33:12]** for the win.

**[33:13]** Thanks for

**[33:15]** sitting through

**[33:16]** all the rules

**[33:17]** explanation if

**[33:18]** you're still with

**[33:19]** me.

**[33:20]** I would really

**[33:20]** rate this as a

**[33:21]** high complexity

**[33:22]** map, more

**[33:23]** complex than the

**[33:24]** library, yes.

**[33:26]** If you're the

**[33:27]** type that wants

**[33:27]** to get together

**[33:28]** with your group

**[33:29]** and hoping to

**[33:29]** play two games

**[33:30]** in one sitting

**[33:31]** would not

**[33:32]** recommend playing

**[33:33]** on Yungoth.

**[33:33]** Maybe if your

**[33:35]** group can get

**[33:35]** a handful of

**[33:37]** plays under your

**[33:37]** belt, this one

**[33:38]** does get a little

**[33:39]** bit easier but

**[33:40]** the first time

**[33:41]** doing all that

**[33:42]** Watcher business

**[33:43]** in the Doom

**[33:44]** Phase is going

**[33:45]** to feel like

**[33:46]** a lot.

**[33:47]** However, once

**[33:48]** you've got that

**[33:49]** out of the way

**[33:49]** the first time

**[33:50]** you play on

**[33:50]** this map, I

**[33:51]** do think it's

**[33:51]** not that bad.

**[33:53]** The Doom

**[33:53]** Phase stuff

**[33:54]** with Awakening

**[33:55]** just have to

**[33:56]** keep in mind

**[33:56]** a couple of

**[33:57]** checkboxes and

**[33:58]** everyone is

**[33:59]** going to have

**[33:59]** a pretty easy

**[34:00]** time staying

**[34:00]** on top of

**[34:01]** that in

**[34:01]** repeated plays.

**[34:05]** Yeah, I think

**[34:05]** that's another

**[34:06]** episode in the

**[34:06]** books, so

**[34:07]** thank you very

**[34:08]** much for

**[34:09]** listening.

**[34:10]** Hopefully you

**[34:10]** found this

**[34:11]** useful.

**[34:12]** Hopefully I've

**[34:12]** convinced you

**[34:13]** to give

**[34:14]** Yoggoth a go

**[34:15]** at least once.

**[34:16]** I do think

**[34:16]** it's worth

**[34:17]** playing.
