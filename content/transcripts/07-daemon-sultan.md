## Transcript

**[00:00]** The boundless demon-sultan Azathoth, whose names no lips dare speak aloud,

**[00:05]** and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time,

**[00:10]** amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin, monotonous whine

**[00:16]** of accursed flutes, to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly, awkwardly,

**[00:22]** and absurdly, the gigantic, ultimate gods, the blind, voiceless, tenebrous, mindless,

**[00:29]** other gods, whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos, Narlathotep.

**[00:34]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way. I'm Graham. I'll be your host.

**[00:57]** Today, I'm really excited to bring to you a guide about a faction that, at time of recording,

**[01:05]** only some people around the world are just now getting their hands on, and that is demon-sultan.

**[01:11]** There's a lot to dive into here, so I'll just jump right in with my opening thoughts. First thing,

**[01:18]** demon-sultan has three great old ones, three different avatars, each one representing a

**[01:24]** different aspect of the blind idiot god Azathoth. In addition to three great old ones, the two of

**[01:31]** them, avatar thesis and avatar antithesis, have a variable cost that you can pay when you summon

**[01:38]** them. We've never seen anything like that before in Cthulhu Wars. Previously, only Yellow Sign and

**[01:44]** Wind Walker had two great old ones, and if you've played any amount of games with Yellow Sign or

**[01:51]** Wind Walker, you know that having both your great old ones and being able to do a ritual is going to

**[01:57]** give you two Elder Signs, and if you're able to do it more than once, it's really going to rack up a

**[02:01]** lot of doom for you over the course of the game. Three great old ones, three Elder Signs, even if

**[02:07]** you're on one Gate, that's so much doom. Demon-sultan is the ultimate stalling faction. Pretty much its

**[02:16]** whole game plan is involving many different combinations of one and zero cost actions.

**[02:25]** It can be hard to predict what a good demon-sultan player might do because there's just so many

**[02:30]** possibilities. With all the tools, a good demon-sultan player is going to be able to adapt to any situation

**[02:37]** that comes up anytime in the mid to late game. In exchange for having so many stalling options, it

**[02:44]** has a total lack of a movement ability. When I say movement ability, I mean something like

**[02:50]** Blight from Crawling Chaos, Avatar from Black Goat, He Who's Not to be Named from Yellow Sign,

**[02:56]** things like that. Usually every faction has some sort of way to move multiple spaces like that.

**[03:03]** Even in spite of lacking the movement abilities of other factions, I still think this faction is

**[03:10]** one of the strongest if not interacted with properly. It can outpace some other factions

**[03:16]** in terms of doom if nothing's done about it. Cho-cho and demon-sultan in a race and nobody

**[03:22]** is doing anything about it, I fully back demon-sultan to win that race 100% of the time,

**[03:28]** and you'll understand why after listening to this guide. The demon-sultan faction is also one of the

**[03:34]** most social factions, has a lot of tactics to engage in social engineering with the other

**[03:39]** players. And if you don't know what social engineering is, that's kind of like doing

**[03:44]** favors for people and expecting favors in return. Demon-sultan has a lot of ways to give gifts to

**[03:53]** people they want to be friends with. They also have a lot of ways to punish people who are not

**[03:57]** cooperating with them. The most Machiavellian faction, I would say. This faction is incredibly

**[04:05]** strong. This faction is a menace. It can't be allowed to exist the way that the Tsang tribe

**[04:12]** of the Cho-cho can't be allowed to exist. It is just insanely good if you don't do anything about

**[04:18]** it. This is one of the strongest engine factions in the whole game. Although this faction is not

**[04:24]** with me in real life right now, I have played with and against this one pretty extensively on

**[04:29]** Tabletop Simulator. I have a decent understanding of how to play this faction, how to play against

**[04:35]** this faction. I also consulted with several people I consider to be demon-sultan experts, so

**[04:42]** hopefully you'll find this guide to be very useful in understanding how to play with the

**[04:48]** demon-sultan faction, but also understanding how to play against the demon-sultan faction.

**[04:54]** I'm releasing these guides sort of out of order just because I know people are getting this

**[04:59]** faction in real life pretty soon, so I wanted to make a detailed resource for this faction

**[05:04]** for anybody to use or share with their friends right off the bat.

**[05:10]** Let's start with the faction overview. The setup for demon-sultan is very strange and

**[05:16]** different from anything that has been in the game prior. You set up with four starting Power

**[05:22]** and no units anywhere on the map. I think I quickly need to talk about the unique faction

**[05:29]** ability which will make all that setup make a lot more sense. The unique faction ability for

**[05:35]** demon-sultan is psychosis. It's a zero-cost action and you must have an acolyte in your pool to take

**[05:42]** it. You can select an area on the map that has no units from any faction and place an acolyte

**[05:47]** from your pool there. With this ability, demon-sultan is going to be able to place their

**[05:55]** acolytes on the map in all kinds of different locations, even more freedom of placing at the

**[06:01]** start of the game than something like flight can allow for. It's also a zero-cost action,

**[06:07]** so if the demon-sultan player has acolytes in their pool and there's open spaces on the map

**[06:13]** that's key, spaces without any units in them, they will have several free zero-cost actions

**[06:19]** to take to stall and to get their acolytes back out on the map. So we've done the unique

**[06:26]** faction ability sort of out of order, but we needed to. So we're setting up. We've got four

**[06:32]** Power and no units on the map. The demon-sultan player is going to be pretty much using psychosis

**[06:38]** for their first six actions of the game no matter what. That's what I would recommend doing anyway.

**[06:44]** The first area you place an acolyte in becomes your starting area. So when playing demon-sultan,

**[06:51]** you have to really take that into consideration, and also the mix of factions at the table.

**[06:57]** If there are a lot more fightier factions like a Cthulhu or Windwalker or Crawling Chaos,

**[07:04]** I'd recommend somewhere far away, which gives you time to expand quickly. If there are engine

**[07:09]** factions in the game, a Cho-Cho or a Yellow Sign or Ancients, which accumulate doom quickly

**[07:17]** if uninterrupted, I would consider setting up close to them, almost even adjacent to them,

**[07:23]** and I can explain more why that is later on in the guide when I go over demon-sultan openings.

**[07:30]** Let's go over the demon-sultan Spellbook requirements on their factions sheet.

**[07:35]** One of them is have one of each larva in play. The demon-sultan has three great old ones. Each of them

**[07:43]** has a larval form, and those are the monsters that the demon-sultan player has to work with.

**[07:49]** They all cost one Power to summon. I'll talk more about them in a bit.

**[07:54]** Next Spellbook requirement, an abandoned Gate is on the map during the gather Power phase.

**[07:59]** You can always step off of a Gate on or off a Gate as an unlimited action with one of your

**[08:04]** acolytes. I don't really recommend doing that here. Your opponents, if they're any good,

**[08:10]** are going to be capturing demon-sultan Cultists often off of normal Gates, also off of chaos

**[08:18]** Gates, which I'll talk more about. It's totally normal for demon-sultan to have an abandoned Gate.

**[08:25]** Even more common to have an abandoned chaos Gate, so you don't really need to work for this spell

**[08:30]** very much. I consider it pretty free. You're just going to get it naturally over the course of the

**[08:35]** game. Next, during any doom phase, you declare that each other player chooses to receive one

**[08:42]** Power or one doom, and you gain everything that they gain. This Spellbook requirement is really

**[08:48]** cool. It's totally free, and it gives you Power or doom. I find that most of the time, factions opt

**[08:56]** to gain the Power, and that's great for you because after the first action phase, building your Gate

**[09:02]** and psychosis-ing all of your acolytes, you're only going to start action phase two with eight Power.

**[09:07]** You'd really like to be playing with 10 or 11 Power if possible, and you're usually able to

**[09:12]** get that most of the time. This book is free, and it's great. You can take any Spellbook you need in

**[09:19]** the first doom phase of the game. Last three Spellbook requirements, you can probably guess

**[09:24]** what they are. You've got three great old ones, so awaken avatar thesis, awaken avatar antithesis,

**[09:31]** and awaken avatar synthesis. Not much to say here other than your great old ones. They're not

**[09:39]** inexpensive to awaken. You're going to need to pay at least 19 Power. Eight Power for thesis

**[09:46]** combined with antithesis. That will make more sense shortly. Eight Power for your synthesis,

**[09:51]** and you're going to have to pay three Power for having one of each larven.

**[09:56]** play. That's equivalent to something like Crawling Chaos who needs to spend 20 Power to win the game,

**[10:02]** I mean to get all their books, that is, or Sleepers paying slightly more than that if

**[10:08]** they're paying 9 Power for their books, 8 for the toad, that's 17, and a cheap ritual that's

**[10:14]** 22 or 23. You're gonna have to spend a similar amount of Power to win the game is my point.

**[10:18]** Okay, let's go over the units for Demon Sultan. Starting with the Demon Sultan Acolytes,

**[10:27]** we've already talked about them quite a bit because of their way they interact with the

**[10:32]** Demon Sultan's unique faction ability Psychosis. The Demon Sultan Acolytes look pretty cool,

**[10:38]** they look like a crazy guy who's lost most of his hair, maybe he's got his ancestor's skull

**[10:44]** on a staff or something, pretty deranged looking and you'd probably have to be in order to be

**[10:51]** thinking about summoning Azathoth. I don't have too much to say about the Acolytes other than

**[10:56]** you're gonna get your Acolytes captured an awful lot, so get used to placing them with Psychosis

**[11:01]** and just think about recruiting, you're gonna be replacing your Acolytes quite a bit over the game.

**[11:07]** The monsters Demon Sultan has access to are three different types of larva, and those are all

**[11:14]** matching with the Avatar Great Old Ones, which you have three of. Larvathesis, which looks like

**[11:22]** something you'd probably find on the inside of your nose, if I'm being honest. You've got larva

**[11:27]** antithesis that looks a little bit like a tiny, I don't know, Venus flytrap, maybe a sarlacc from

**[11:35]** Star Wars thing going on. And you've got larvathesis, which kind of looks like a little

**[11:39]** grub. If you've seen Dire Azathoth, it looks like a mini Dire Azathoth. In real life, maybe it looks

**[11:45]** like one of those centipede, maybe like a silverfish, you ever see those things? Fucking

**[11:50]** fast, nasty, they're disgusting. Anyway, you've got two of each of your larva, and they each cost

**[11:58]** one Power to summon. They have zero combat normally, but as soon as the matching Avatar

**[12:05]** Great Old One is in play, they will have two combat. Until that happens, they're just gonna be

**[12:11]** kind of like a Ghoul, good enough for guarding a Gate, but not much else.

**[12:16]** Now we have the three Great Old Ones of the Demon Sultan faction, which I'm just gonna talk about

**[12:21]** each in turn. There are general avatar rules for all of these. Number one, you must have a larva

**[12:29]** of the desired avatar in play. So for example, awakening avatar athesis, you need larvathesis

**[12:35]** in play. Number two, costs vary with the avatar. That's going to make more sense in a minute.

**[12:40]** And number three, once the cost is paid, you replace the larva with the correct avatar.

**[12:46]** Let's get into some avatar specifics. Avatar thesis. It looks kind of like, I don't know,

**[12:53]** a pepperoni roll of doom. My wife's a baker. It reminds me of some kind of croissant or some kind

**[13:00]** of bun or some kind of baked good. I can't unsee it. How to awaken it. You set the Azathoth marker

**[13:07]** on the Doom Track on any desired spot between 0 and 8. Then you pay Power equal to that marker's

**[13:15]** setting, and then you have to choose each other player gains 1 Power or an enemy player of your

**[13:21]** choice gains 2 Power. The first thing that is very interesting about this is any Power you want from

**[13:30]** 0 to 8, you could awaken this Great Old One for 0 Power, which is pretty big deal on the second

**[13:36]** action phase. Having a Great Old One that you didn't pay anything for and having it be able to

**[13:42]** roam around the board when everyone else takes the turn off is pretty wild. Of course, you could also

**[13:48]** pay anywhere between 1 and 8 Power as well. The combat for avatar thesis is equal to whatever you

**[13:57]** set the Azathoth marker's position to. So the more Power you pump into this first Great Old One,

**[14:03]** the more combat dice it's going to roll. The Spellbook that works with avatar thesis is

**[14:09]** undirected energy, which for 1 Power flips itself face down and it gives you Power equal to the

**[14:17]** number of factions in the area with your avatar thesis. So the more players in one area, the more

**[14:24]** Power you're going to get back. I'll talk more about that in the Spellbook part of this guide.

**[14:30]** Whatever you pay and whatever dice you roll is going to be the inverse of how it works with

**[14:35]** the next Great Old One, avatar antithesis. This Great Old One, it's got the full-on Star Wars

**[14:43]** Sarlacc effect going on. Just a big giant bowl that's a mouth and has lots of rows of teeth.

**[14:52]** This one is really gross but also really cool. So how to awaken the second Great Old One?

**[14:59]** Avatar thesis must have been awakened is the first requirement. Need not be in play,

**[15:03]** that's important. Number two, pay Power to 8 minus the Azathoth marker's setting. So remember when

**[15:10]** we awoke avatar thesis, we did set it to some number. This Great Old One just costs the inverse

**[15:17]** of that payment. So if you get a really cheap thesis, you're going to be paying for a more

**[15:22]** expensive antithesis and so on and everywhere in between. You could spend 4 Power on each,

**[15:29]** you could spend 8 Power on this avatar, or you could have spent all of your 8 Power on

**[15:34]** thesis. I'll get into more when you might want to do either of those things a little bit later.

**[15:40]** The third requirement is each other player gains one doom or choose an enemy player who gains one

**[15:46]** Elder Sign. This is pretty nice means of social engineering that we mentioned earlier. You could

**[15:52]** be nice to everybody or there's someone you especially want to have in your corner. Just

**[15:57]** give them an Elder Sign. You can boost up somebody who's fallen behind and not give any doom to

**[16:02]** anybody. You can give somebody an Elder Sign and make them a bigger target than they already are,

**[16:08]** or you can do the diplomatic thing and give everybody one doom so nobody thinks that you're

**[16:14]** playing any favorites right off the bat. The combat for avatar antithesis is equal to 8

**[16:22]** minus the Azathoth marker's position, so again that is going to be the inverse of whatever

**[16:28]** combat avatar thesis currently has. The Spellbook that works with avatar antithesis is fiendish

**[16:36]** growth. You can flip this Spellbook face down if avatar antithesis is in play for one Power,

**[16:43]** and you can place one free monster or acolyte from your pool in avatar antithesis' area per

**[16:50]** faction with units in the area including yours. So similar to undirected energy, but this time

**[16:56]** placing acolytes or monsters. More on that in a bit. The last great old one for demon sultan

**[17:03]** is avatar synthesis. To awaken it, both avatar thesis and avatar antithesis must have been

**[17:11]** awakened. They need not be in play, so that means as long as you've done it once before

**[17:18]** you're good. That's important. Second thing, you pay 8 Power. Third thing, you roll the Azathoth die.

**[17:26]** This die you've seen before if you've played with the Azathoth neutral expansion. It is a d6 plus

**[17:34]** 2, so the lowest thing you can roll is a 3, the highest thing you can roll is an 8. Roll the

**[17:40]** Azathoth die. All enemies have two minutes to decide how to collectively lose that much Power

**[17:46]** and or doom. If they can't agree, you win the game. In a two to three player game, have the roll result

**[17:53]** rounded up. Wow, let's talk about that third awakening requirement. So this is pretty much the

**[18:00]** ultimate social engineering mechanic that's ever been implemented into Cthulhu Wars. This is like

**[18:06]** thousand forms and groth on steroids. Normally with those abilities, if the players don't come

**[18:12]** to an agreement, some bad stuff can happen, but the game is not necessarily over here. The game

**[18:19]** can just end if the players are that mad at each other, are that sad against each other.

**[18:25]** It sounds like it would never happen. Trust me, I have seen it happen. Maybe you know people who are

**[18:31]** very spiteful. They will blow up the game so that Demon Sultan can win. So just be really careful

**[18:38]** if you're playing against Demon Sultan. Try your best to talk it out, otherwise you're done and the

**[18:43]** game's over. Combat. First you roll the Azathoth die d6 plus two, then you roll that many combat dice.

**[18:53]** So this avatar is going to roll a minimum of three and a maximum of eight. Not as high as some, but

**[18:59]** consistently rolling some amount of dice. The ability on avatar synthesis is cosmic ruler.

**[19:08]** It's a post-battle ability. It says when any avatar is chosen to receive a kill or elimination,

**[19:15]** instead you can eliminate another avatar in its stead from anywhere on the map. A lot of

**[19:20]** implications for that ability. That means anytime somebody comes after your great old ones, you're

**[19:25]** always going to choose the one that's most convenient for you to let die. You can get up

**[19:32]** to some shenanigans with this. We've got variable cost great old ones, so if we ever choose to set

**[19:39]** one of their summoning or Power to zero, awakening thesis for zero or awakening thesis for eight,

**[19:49]** and that would make anti-thesis cost zero.

**[19:52]** You can have a zero-cost great old one that can basically just eat a kill anytime that's convenient

**[19:57]** for you and then reawaken Thesis or Anti-Thesis on the cheap. More on that later. This ability

**[20:05]** gives the Demon Sultan player a lot of resilience. I mentioned at the top of the episode, may have

**[20:10]** mentioned, this faction is just a huge threat. You should be going after Demon Sultan and this is why.

**[20:17]** Doesn't seem like they have a lot of combat dice and they don't, but they can really take a beating

**[20:22]** and still come back and just explosively grow all over the game. That's what they do.

**[20:29]** Okay, let's talk about the Demon Sultan spell books proper. So the first thing you want to know

**[20:35]** about all of Demon Sultan's books, they have this in common. Every time you use any of them,

**[20:40]** you flip them face down. In the same box where your psychosis action is listed, you also have

**[20:47]** a unique ability during each doom phase. You flip all your face down faction spell books face up

**[20:53]** again. All these spell books are one use per action phase, which is really interesting and

**[20:59]** a bit of a puzzle and you know from my Black Goat Guide, I love puzzles. So I find it very,

**[21:04]** very entertaining to try to optimize every action phase and use as many of these as possible,

**[21:11]** as effectively as possible. The first spell book is Chaos Gate. It's a one-cost action.

**[21:19]** Flip this spell book face down, then place a Chaos Gate in any area without a Gate. Chaos Gates are

**[21:25]** special kinds of buildings. They can only be constructed by or occupied by Demon Sultan

**[21:32]** Cultists. Otherwise, it's like a normal Gate except that it can only be placed via the Chaos

**[21:38]** Gate spell book. During the doom phase, an abandoned Chaos Gate is exchanged for a normal Gate.

**[21:46]** So this spell book is crazy. This is kind of the signature, one of the signature books of

**[21:52]** the Demon Sultan faction. Hopefully people will read up on this faction or listen to this guide

**[21:57]** before you play your first games against Demon Sultan because if you don't, this faction is just

**[22:02]** going to destroy you. You can see this is a one-cost action to build a Gate. That is huge.

**[22:09]** Gates are expensive. They cost three to build normally. Demon Sultan, from very early on in

**[22:14]** the game, and I do think you should take this spell book first or second every game,

**[22:19]** from very early on in the game, Demon Sultan is going to have the ability to build not only

**[22:24]** normal Gates but also, for one cost, an extra Chaos Gate every round that only they can control.

**[22:32]** Because you can build cheap Gates, that's one reason why people are going to want to capture

**[22:36]** your acolytes a lot. That's why that Spellbook requirement about an abandoned Gate on the map

**[22:42]** is not too difficult because if people capture you off a Chaos Gate, they're not going to be

**[22:47]** able to occupy the Gate themselves with their acolytes because it's not a normal Gate and won't

**[22:51]** become one until the next Doom phase. In addition to being a crazy new building that provides Doom

**[23:00]** and Power for Demon Sultan on the cheap, Chaos Gates also have another nasty ability associated

**[23:06]** with them and that is Animate Matter, Demon Sultan's second Spellbook. It's a one-cost action.

**[23:12]** You flip this Spellbook face down and then you can move a controlled Chaos Gate from its area

**[23:17]** to an adjacent area, taking its Cultist along. You cannot move the Gate to another player's start

**[23:23]** area. If the new area has an existing physical Gate, replace that Gate with the Chaos Gate.

**[23:30]** Whoa, so two Gates can't exist in one area, so with Animate Matter, you are able to blow up

**[23:39]** other players' Gates. You can't go into start areas notably, otherwise this ability would be

**[23:45]** busted good, but it's still very effective. Gates are expensive and Demon Sultan has a way,

**[23:52]** if you're not playing ball and not cooperating with them, they can just decide to blow up your

**[23:57]** Gate. If you're at low Power, no Power, and this faction is excellent at stalling people out

**[24:03]** so that they get into that spot, Demon Sultan can just decide,

**[24:07]** hmm, no, I think you're going to get one less doom and do less Power next action phase.

**[24:14]** How do you like them apples? Third Spellbook also has a little bit to do with Chaos Gates,

**[24:20]** so I'm just going to do it now, and that is Traders. It's a one-cost action. Flip this

**[24:26]** Spellbook face down, replace your controlled Chaos Gate with a normal Gate, and replace

**[24:30]** its controlling Cultist with another player's Cultist from their pool. Your Cultist returns

**[24:36]** to your pool. If you have no other units in the area, gain an Elder Sign. I was sent a quote from

**[24:43]** Jaraxxus on Discord, who's a good Demon Sultan player, and I can't really put this any better

**[24:48]** than they did. I love Traders. It's a great Spellbook for a few different things. It gives

**[24:54]** you doom, it gives you another stall with psychosis, and you can use it to defend. So

**[24:59]** someone moves in on your undefended Chaos Gate to capture your Cultist, and suddenly the Gate's

**[25:04]** normal, the Cultist is somebody else's, and you get a free doom and a Chaos Gate to be put into

**[25:10]** your pool anywhere else, and as an added bonus, there's now a normal Gate for people to fight

**[25:15]** over. As for who to give the Gate to, it really depends. Sometimes you want to boost up the

**[25:20]** weakest faction because it's pretty risk-free and nice. Other times you want to beef up the

**[25:25]** strongest so there's another bigger threat for everyone else to fight, or you can use it to

**[25:29]** keep alliances intact. I wouldn't say you should try to regain your lost Gate though unless you

**[25:34]** have good reason to, because one of the great things about Traders is you can now relocate

**[25:39]** the Cultist and Chaos Gate to a much safer area on the map. Totally agree with Jaraxxus on this one.

**[25:46]** The potential for social engineering with this book is also really high. Get out of dodge and

**[25:52]** protect an acolyte is great, and you can make it a really juicy treat for another player and get

**[25:58]** them on your good side, or put them in harm's way. One other thing to mention here that I didn't

**[26:04]** mention in my High Priest episode is this book actually can place a High Priest because it says

**[26:12]** you replace its controlling Cultist with another player's Cultist. It does not say acolyte, so you can

**[26:18]** replace your normal acolyte with somebody else's High Priest and give them a Gate, and that is a

**[26:26]** very fine prize indeed. Just to make sure I covered all my bases here, Earth cats are also treated as

**[26:33]** Cultists, so if cats are in the game, you can replace your Chaos Gate with a normal Gate and

**[26:39]** place an Earth cat next to it, which can't control Gates. Next Spellbook is Undirected Energy.

**[26:46]** Mentioned it earlier with Avatar Thesis. It's a one-cost action. You flip this Spellbook face down

**[26:52]** if Avatar Thesis is in play, and you gain one Power per faction with units in Thesis' area,

**[26:58]** including you. So at a minimum, if you are the only faction in the area, flipping this Spellbook

**[27:05]** face down is a turn's worth of stalling because you pay one Power to flip it, and then you gain

**[27:11]** one Power back because there's one faction in the area. This Spellbook can be very spicy the way that

**[27:17]** it scales with the number of players and is particularly effective if you are using traders

**[27:25]** or something else to make the other players set against each other and fight each other.

**[27:31]** If you can get two or three players in the area suddenly, this book is wild. It's giving you a

**[27:36]** stall, but it's also giving you free Power. Using this book once is good enough, but you may be able

**[27:43]** to use it more than once with the next Spellbook I'll just do right now is Consummation. It's a

**[27:49]** one-cost action. You flip the Spellbook face down, then flip one of your face-down faction Spellbooks

**[27:55]** face up again, permitting it to reuse this turn. This Spellbook's pretty simple. It just lets you

**[28:01]** use one of your five other Spellbooks a second time during the action phase. You'll want to

**[28:07]** think carefully about when to use this one and what book you want to use twice. In some spots,

**[28:12]** you might want to do Chaos Gate a second time. You might want to be especially mean to somebody

**[28:19]** and use Animate Matter a second time. You might want to gain extra Power and use Undirected Energy

**[28:26]** a second time. This can be really, really strong when other players are out of Power because you've

**[28:32]** stalled them to that point. Or Fiendish Growth even, the final Spellbook. Flip this Spellbook

**[28:38]** face down as a one-cost action if Avatar Antithesis is in play. Place one free monster or

**[28:45]** acolyte from your pool in Avatar Antithesis' area. Perf action with units in the area,

**[28:51]** including yours. This book is pretty nice. It's a way to quickly reinforce an area on defense,

**[28:58]** ideally with some matching larva. You can even get your acolytes back this way,

**[29:05]** though I think larva is more commonly the move. This can be a nice way to, when other players are

**[29:11]** out of Power, maybe you've got them to that point, you can march Avatar Antithesis over a Gate,

**[29:18]** summon a bunch of monsters and maybe an acolyte, and capture. You're all over that Gate and it's

**[29:24]** defended right away. I find this book a little less useful than Undirected Energy, but it's got

**[29:30]** its applications. It can be very, very good, and like Undirected Energy, scales with the number of

**[29:36]** players in the game. That's all the Demon Sultan Spellbooks out of the way, so we can start to

**[29:42]** talk about the different openings that Demon Sultan can go for. The first decision you have to make

**[29:48]** is this faction is right at the start of the game, which is where you place your first acolyte with

**[29:53]** Psychosis, because that's going to be considered your starting area. I mentioned earlier, but

**[29:59]** when you're choosing your start area as Demon Sultan, you want to think about the

**[30:03]** faction composition in the game, specifically in the first action phase, where you construct that

**[30:09]** first Gate. That's where you're sinking most of your four Power into. Your biggest enemies,

**[30:15]** I would say, are the fighty factions, mostly because you can't really roll a comparable amount

**[30:21]** of dice to a big death ball from Cthulhu or Wind Walker. If there's a bigger splash of fighty

**[30:28]** factions in the game, I would set up somewhere far away from them. That's going to let you use

**[30:33]** your Chaos Gate book early, and at action phase two, maybe build multiple Gates and start the

**[30:40]** next action phase on three or even four Gates, depending on what you need to do. If there are a

**[30:46]** good mix of engine factions in the game, that'd be like Cho-Cho, Yellow Sign, Ancients. Getting

**[30:52]** close to them is a pretty good idea. They're not known for their combat, so that's going to give

**[30:58]** you the opportunity to awaken very cheap Avatar Thesis for maybe only zero Power, which is still

**[31:05]** going to be good enough to go around capturing acolytes and maybe stealing Gates early on in the

**[31:11]** game, or leveraging undirected energy in an area with one of the factions you're taking acolytes

**[31:18]** from. Action phase one is pretty rote for Demon Sultan. After you choose your starting area and

**[31:25]** place your other psychosis acolytes, you're going to be able to build a Gate and summon a larva to

**[31:31]** protect it. You're going to summon Thesis Larva because you need to awaken Avatar Thesis first.

**[31:36]** In the first gather Power phase, you're probably going to be around eight Power. Hopefully you have

**[31:41]** all your acolytes, but folks might capture them and that's totally expected. In the first doom

**[31:46]** phase, this is a good spot to take your quote-unquote free spell book where you choose everybody gains

**[31:52]** Power or doom and you gain everything that they gain. That's going to allow you to kind of be

**[31:57]** on pace with the other players, hopefully at 10 or 11 Power. You might find that engine factions

**[32:04]** might opt to take the doom, but I think most of the time people take the Power and that makes sense

**[32:09]** because anything that you can do on top of summoning action phase two Cthulhu or Narnalathotep

**[32:15]** is usually a good thing. Expect to have more Power than just the eight that you started with at gather

**[32:21]** Power. You probably should take Chaos Gate as your first book from the doom phase. In action phase two

**[32:31]** with your hopefully eight Power plus a little bit extra from your Spellbook requirement,

**[32:37]** I see three major paths that you can go down and this is probably dependent on the faction

**[32:43]** composition. Many people are going to be taking off the second action phase in order to summon

**[32:48]** their great old ones, so as Demon Sultan this is your opportunity to decide whether you're going to

**[32:53]** wake up one or two great old ones yourself. You have a couple of options here. First thing would be

**[33:00]** cheap avatar thesis and building a couple Gates. Lots of engine factions. You're probably set up

**[33:07]** close by. Doing a zero-cost thesis is going to let you get some shenanigans in, do some captures,

**[33:14]** use undirected energy for a profit. I would generally take undirected energy when you awaken

**[33:21]** avatar thesis for the first time, but if you want to get greedy and start with even more Power,

**[33:26]** you can take Consummation as your second book and go for double Chaos Gates. That's three Power for

**[33:33]** two Gates over three actions, so not only are you stalling with one-cost actions, but you're also

**[33:38]** building multiple Gates and you're going to start action phase three with four to five Gates and

**[33:43]** lots of Power. Second thing you could do is summon an anti-thesis larva and try to wake up both thesis

**[33:53]** and anti-thesis in one action phase. If there's a bunch of fight factions in the game, you're probably

**[34:00]** going to instead want to spend three or four Power on thesis just so that your first two great old

**[34:05]** ones have some amount of combat and can do something if they get attacked. If you wake up two great old

**[34:10]** ones in action phase two, you're going to probably give up on building an extra Gate, but you may

**[34:16]** have enough Power to build a Chaos Gate still, and if there are fight factions in the game, you're

**[34:23]** going to be two-thirds of the way to waking up your last avatar, which you do want to do as soon

**[34:28]** as possible so you can start better soaking up hits from those fights that are coming to you.

**[34:34]** One thing you can do in action phase two as well that's more safe would be summon the remaining

**[34:40]** two types of larva and get another Spellbook requirement met. You probably summoned larva

**[34:45]** thesis in action phase one if you were doing it right. Spending two Power here, summoning two

**[34:51]** larva, getting another book. This is another good easy way to get Chaos Gate going with consummation.

**[34:58]** Awakening a thesis, not too much Power, then you should have enough to make multiple Chaos Gates

**[35:04]** and maybe a normal Gate as well. Action phase three, your top objective here is to awaken avatar

**[35:13]** synthesis if you have enough Power. You might not be able to do much with the rest of the action

**[35:19]** phase, but remember this is worth doing. You're getting a Spellbook requirement, of course.

**[35:24]** You're going to force the other players to lose Power or doom, so you actually are hurting them

**[35:28]** by doing this. You're hopefully going to be at this point on one or two Gates with all of your

**[35:34]** great old ones and you can safely sit on them in the following action phase. Getting avatar synthesis

**[35:41]** out as early as possible is just a good idea, especially if the fight factions are in the game.

**[35:47]** You really want to have this one because they are going to come after you. You're building lots of

**[35:51]** Gates and making tons of Power and soon you're going to be doing a bunch of rituals, probably

**[35:56]** every doom phase from then on. Once you have avatar synthesis, you've got cosmic ruler. That's

**[36:02]** going to just let you pick whatever is the most convenient for you to lose at the time. Ideally,

**[36:08]** your cheapest great old one, whether that's thesis or anti-thesis. That's going to be really strong.

**[36:15]** That's going to let you just get battered by combat dice and still able to recover pretty

**[36:20]** easily by reawakening whatever the great old one is that you chose to get killed. Remember on those

**[36:27]** awakening requirements, you can give that all to one player if you want to. If someone didn't punch

**[36:33]** you, give them an Elder Sign or give them some Power. With the rest of your Power in action phase

**[36:40]** three, just do what you do best, which is stall, which is use your other spell books here. You

**[36:45]** probably have most of them. Just do what you can to stay on those Gates. If you didn't go for a

**[36:52]** double great old one in action phase two, you're definitely going to want to spend the rest of your

**[36:57]** Power in action phase three waking up avatar and antithesis and maintaining at least two or three

**[37:03]** Gates so that you have the eight Power you need to summon avatar synthesis in action phase four.

**[37:10]** Action phase four and beyond, your top priority is awakening avatar synthesis if you haven't

**[37:17]** already done that previously so that you can get all of your books. But if you have done that,

**[37:23]** you would just want to use all the tools you have available to stall, wait out the other players,

**[37:29]** and then try to maintain a great old one count of two or three so that you can just ritual every

**[37:35]** doom phase from then on and win the game. We said it at the top, but even one Gate and three great

**[37:42]** old ones is going to be five to seven doom, so any amount of Gates you have on top of that,

**[37:46]** ritualing for demon sultan is just actually gross and insane. A three Gate demon sultan can easily

**[37:53]** get ten doom in one doom phase, so be really careful about that. Don't take it the wrong way.

**[37:59]** If you're playing demon sultan and people attack you, they are just kind of keeping you in check.

**[38:04]** If they don't, you're going to run away with the game rather quickly. I'm sort of already

**[38:09]** segwaying into playing demon sultan now that we're talking so deep into the game,

**[38:14]** into action phase four, so let's just go ahead and start getting into those tips and tricks.

**[38:19]** The social engineering, this faction is thriving when the other players are set against each other

**[38:25]** and if you're uncontained, you can quickly explode in doom and Gates and Elder Signs and win the

**[38:32]** game. You've got a lot of ways for bribing players to do favors for you, that's traitors

**[38:37]** and avatar awakenings, and you've got plenty of tools to punish people who are not cooperating

**[38:42]** with you, so the best table talking players are going to have a great time as demon sultan and

**[38:48]** the worst table talking players who just want to do their own thing, you're probably going to get

**[38:53]** bullied out of the game and it might be partly your fault if you don't talk about it. What you

**[38:58]** don't want is the other players to be allied against you because they're going to be able

**[39:03]** to work together to capture your acolytes and make sure you're not on a lot of Gates.

**[39:10]** Demon sultan has the most tools to stall out of any faction in Cthulhu Wars, maybe aside from

**[39:16]** lethargy, okay, assuming there's no lethargy. You've got so many one-cost actions and zero-cost

**[39:23]** actions. One thing you really want to do as demon sultan that you're interested in is getting your

**[39:29]** Cultists to go back in your pool, so don't be afraid if players are in your area to just declare

**[39:35]** a battle and get your acolytes killed. That's going to put them back in your pool, which is

**[39:39]** going to in turn set up more stalls for you. Every time you use traitors, it's

**[39:45]** you can use undirected energy effectively, you're going to be giving yourself more opportunity to

**[39:50]** spend your Power slowly and just wait out the other players. It's very easy to be on less Power

**[39:57]** than the other players as this faction and just drag your feet, go as slowly as possible. They

**[40:01]** will run out of Power and you'll be able to do some significant things afterward, whether that's

**[40:06]** build more Gates or capture or awaken or summon, whatever it is. As I said earlier, your Spellbooks

**[40:16]** that you want to take early on probably almost always are chaos Gate and consummation. That's

**[40:21]** going to ensure in action phase two and onward that you have the potential to create one or two

**[40:28]** chaos Gates for two or three Power every action phase and have the Gates to give you the Power

**[40:35]** you need to awaken your remaining great old ones. On the doom Spellbook requirement that gives

**[40:42]** everybody Power doom and gives you the same, use this one 95% of the time but maybe not if crawling

**[40:50]** chaos specifically is in the game. There's crawling chaos again, everybody's enemy. You're going to

**[40:55]** love doing that faction guide. You don't really want to give crawling chaos their 11th Power so

**[41:00]** that they can both awaken and do thousand forms. This faction is not your friend. Crawling chaos has

**[41:07]** their harbinger ability and they are loving to come after great old ones that don't roll a lot

**[41:12]** of dice like king and yellow and your great old ones which never really are going to be able to

**[41:17]** roll more than eight dice on their own. So do not help crawling chaos unless you can strike some

**[41:23]** kind of a deal with them. We mentioned this earlier as well, your plan A with this faction should be

**[41:30]** get out all of your great old ones as soon as possible. You need to spend 19 Power to do this,

**[41:36]** so that's one for each of your larvae and then eight for your combination of thesis and antithesis

**[41:42]** and eight more for synthesis. So this is a lot of Power. This is very similar to crawling chaos

**[41:48]** needing to spend 10 Power for Spellbooks and 10 Power for narlathotep or sleeper needing to spend

**[41:56]** nine Power for three Spellbooks plus eight for a toad plus five at the minimum for all of their

**[42:01]** Spellbooks. You have a lot of Power that you need to spend in order to win the game, so just be

**[42:07]** careful about that. Be careful about getting greedy and trying to be too cute and going for too many

**[42:12]** Gates. You really do need your great old ones in order to effectively hold down areas and maintain

**[42:19]** the tempo of doom and Power that you need. Tips and tricks for once you get avatar synthesis.

**[42:27]** You're going to be able to kill thesis or antithesis at a useful time and reset the cost to

**[42:34]** kind of save on Power when awakening and reset combat dice. This is going to be really useful

**[42:40]** against any fighty factions that want to totally delete you from the game. I think most of the time

**[42:46]** you want to kill avatar thesis first. Every time you wake up thesis, you reset the Azathoth counter.

**[42:54]** Use this to your advantage and creatively set the Power you need for the right situation.

**[43:01]** Here's a good example. You manage to get thesis out for seven or eight Power and then you get wiped

**[43:09]** out. The Azathoth counter is still at seven or eight. You can reawaken avatar antithesis for one

**[43:17]** or zero Power. Then you can reawaken thesis again. Every time you awaken thesis, you choose how much

**[43:24]** you pay. You can reawaken thesis for zero here and that will also reset the combat dice for antithesis,

**[43:34]** which was rolling nothing. Now it's all of a sudden rolling seven or eight dice and you have two

**[43:39]** great old ones again. In some cases this can be the difference between winning and losing the game.

**[43:44]** The ability to recover and effectively pay zero or one Power for getting both your great old ones

**[43:51]** before a doom phase in which you plan to ritual. The important thing here is just to keep your

**[43:57]** avatar synthesis alive at all costs. Basically you're always going to have two lives to lose,

**[44:03]** which are your other great old ones. Never lose synthesis if possible. Otherwise you should be

**[44:08]** able to maintain your great old one count and just stay resilient and stay guarding your Gates.

**[44:15]** You want to be setting up rivalries and conflict where you can. That means using traders to protect

**[44:22]** yourself, relocate your chaos Gates, and put down a normal Gate for opponents to fight over. Be

**[44:29]** careful. Always look for acolytes in anybody's pool. Otherwise you can't use traders. Remember

**[44:36]** what I said earlier, you can actually place a high priest. That's a really nice gift to give

**[44:41]** somebody. You're effectively giving them two free Power and a Gate. It's a really nice bribe.

**[44:47]** Any faction that is ahead of demon sultan on doom or Gates or Elder Signs is a good target for

**[44:54]** animate matter. Just keep in mind that you can't animate matter into a faction start area, so

**[45:00]** make sure to place your chaos Gates strategically with that in mind.

**[45:06]** Not too much else to say on playing demon sultan, so now on to thwarting demon sultan, which hopefully

**[45:13]** folks get a lot of mileage out of because a lot of people, I think, have not played against this

**[45:17]** faction too many times or they will have just been playing against them for the first couple of times

**[45:22]** in real life. First thing, capturing demon sultan acolytes is a public service. Demon sultan,

**[45:30]** they want the acolytes in their pool. They love losing them in battle because it lets them use

**[45:35]** psychosis. Capturing demon sultan acolytes is not going to put them back in their pool until the

**[45:40]** next action phase. It's also going to cap them on how many Gates they have. Yeah, you're going to

**[45:45]** give them a Spellbook at some point by capturing them off of a chaos Gate, but you really do want

**[45:50]** to be doing this. Even one Gate might be enough or too many for demon sultan, so don't feel bad

**[45:57]** about picking on their acolytes. It's going to give you Power anyway, obviously, in gather Power, and

**[46:02]** it's going to contain this faction, which is really what you need to do. If you can't confront their

**[46:07]** great old ones directly, make sure that they do not have the ability to wait you out and build a

**[46:13]** bunch of Gates. Another thing you can do that scales well with games that have higher player

**[46:19]** count is simply occupying areas of the map to make psychosis less effective and force demon

**[46:26]** sultan to be able to recruit Cultists the old-fashioned way for one Power apiece. Having

**[46:32]** higher player counts just makes it harder for this unique faction ability to be good.

**[46:39]** Last thing on thwarting demon sultan is just take your opportunities to kill the demon sultan

**[46:44]** avatars very seriously and cooperate with the other players if needed to make sure you can kill

**[46:50]** more than one at once. Once avatar synthesis gets online, it's going to be an uphill battle to

**[46:57]** actually kill all three of them, so if you're planning to go that route, just make sure you

**[47:02]** talk it out. The table talk with the opponents of demon sultan is really important here.

**[47:07]** Ideally, you can take on multiple, maybe demon sultan's on two Gates and they have

**[47:12]** two great old ones on one Gate and one on another. That's great for you.

**[47:16]** Just beat them up if you can. You really want to be able to kill that synthesis if possible. That's

**[47:22]** going to completely mess them up and make them have to spend a significant amount of Power in

**[47:27]** order to get back into the game in a meaningful way. If they don't have avatars in play or the

**[47:32]** less avatars they have in play, the more frail they become. Their larvae are going to start

**[47:37]** rolling zero dice if the matching avatar is not in play, so take advantage of that in order to

**[47:43]** fully demon sultan off the Gates and keep them down. Remember, with even one Gate and three

**[47:49]** great old ones, demon sultan can earn nearly seven doom. Any amount of Gates in excess of one don't

**[47:55]** feel bad for picking on demon sultan players, and demon sultan players don't take it the wrong way

**[48:00]** if people are picking on you. They're just doing the right thing and you deserve it for playing

**[48:05]** this faction. And I think that's the demon sultan guide in the books. This one is going to be a real

**[48:11]** bear for me to edit, so good luck editing, Graham. Hope you enjoyed listening to this and that you

**[48:17]** find this useful. I wanted to get this guide out sooner rather than later because I know folks are

**[48:22]** starting to get demon sultan and the cats and I want to make sure that everybody understands and

**[48:29]** enjoys these factions right from the get-go. I think with any asymmetric game like this,

**[48:34]** totally not knowing what's going on with the faction is probably give them a win maybe in the

**[48:39]** first couple of games that you play, but hopefully you know your enemy if you're playing against

**[48:45]** demon sultan and you now have the tools to succeed if you're choosing to play this faction.

**[48:53]** This faction is very, very fun. I think it's a great addition to the game personally.

**[48:57]** It's so cool. It's Azathoth. What's cooler than that? I always wanted to have an Azathoth faction.

**[49:03]** As soon as I saw the neutral Azathoth expansion and now we have it. It's part of the game.

**[49:10]** I'm happy it's here. Hopefully you are too and hope you have a nice day,

**[49:15]** nice evening, nice morning, wherever it is you are. This has been Opening The Way. Take it easy. Bye!
