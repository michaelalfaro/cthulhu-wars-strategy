## Transcript

**[00:00]** I expect to meet him shortly in a certain dream city we both used to haunt.

**[00:05]** It is rumored in Ulthar, beyond the river Sky, that a new king reigns upon the opal throne of Ilikvad,

**[00:12]** that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight sea,

**[00:18]** wherein the bearded and finny Nori build their singular labyrinths, and I believe I know how to interpret this rumor.

**[00:24]** Certainly, I look forward impatiently to the sight of that great silver key,

**[00:30]** for in its cryptical arabesques there may stand symbolized all the aims and mysteries of a blindly impersonal cosmos.

**[00:36]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:00]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[01:03]** Hope you're doing well. I'm doing my normal thing, where I record in the peace and quiet of the early morning before work,

**[01:11]** trying to squeeze an episode in.

**[01:14]** Today, we are going over the Dreamland Surface Monsters expansion.

**[01:20]** This is an expansion that contains three different sets of neutral monsters that you can include in your games.

**[01:27]** Quick recap on neutral monsters.

**[01:30]** You can purchase them during the Doom phase, rather than summoning them during the Action phase,

**[01:36]** the way you would summon your faction monsters.

**[01:40]** You may only earn one monster type per Doom phase, so you'll only be buying one neutral monster,

**[01:47]** even if there's many of them in the game.

**[01:49]** The theme of this string of episodes that I'm releasing is going to be all based around the Dreamlands.

**[01:57]** So, if you've read Dream Quest Unknown Kadath, the HP Lovecraft story, that's what I'm talking about.

**[02:03]** There's also the Silver Key, and Through the Gates with the Silver Key,

**[02:08]** two other stories set in that same setting,

**[02:11]** with the main character, Randolph Carter,

**[02:14]** and many cats.

**[02:16]** The Dreamlands is a really cool place.

**[02:18]** There's also a Dreamlands map.

**[02:19]** We will cover that as well.

**[02:22]** Here we're covering monsters that live on the surface of the Dreamlands.

**[02:26]** So, without further ado,

**[02:28]** we can just get right into it.

**[02:31]** First monster we have to talk about today

**[02:33]** is the Nori.

**[02:35]** And I know that the Nori are from the story,

**[02:41]** the Silver Key.

**[02:43]** I was not able to find any other reference to them

**[02:46]** other than the very last paragraph of the story,

**[02:49]** which I read to you at the beginning of the episode.

**[02:52]** I don't know much about the Nori.

**[02:54]** It sounds like they're aquatic.

**[02:56]** I'm looking at the sculptor in front of me.

**[02:59]** Looks a bit snake-like,

**[03:01]** almost like a Yig,

**[03:02]** kind of half-human, half-serpent thing going on.

**[03:06]** Gross face with no mouth.

**[03:09]** Looks like it's got three arms.

**[03:10]** That's a bit odd.

**[03:11]** Long, double-sided weapon.

**[03:14]** Looks like the...

**[03:15]** I don't know.

**[03:15]** I don't remember what they're called.

**[03:17]** The Klingon weapons from Star Trek.

**[03:20]** Kind of look like a crazy windshield wiper kind of thing.

**[03:24]** Anyway.

**[03:26]** In order to get the Nori,

**[03:29]** we're going to have to pay two doom to obtain this loyalty card,

**[03:32]** and we're going to place one Nori at the controlled Gate.

**[03:37]** There's three Nori.

**[03:38]** They cost three Power to summon,

**[03:40]** and they have two combat.

**[03:43]** The ability that works with Nori is Grotto's.

**[03:46]** It's an ongoing ability.

**[03:48]** During the doom phase,

**[03:49]** if you have two Nori in play,

**[03:51]** you earn one extra doom point.

**[03:53]** If you have three Nori in play,

**[03:55]** you earn two extra doom points.

**[03:57]** So this is pretty nice.

**[04:01]** Assuming the first Nori is going to cost you two doom and no Power.

**[04:05]** The second one will cost you three Power.

**[04:07]** The third one will cost you three more Power, right?

**[04:10]** If we can maintain two Nori under our control,

**[04:15]** when we get back to the doom phase,

**[04:17]** they will get us back a doom point.

**[04:19]** So they'll pay for themselves in two doom phases if you have two of them,

**[04:24]** in one doom phase if you have all three of them.

**[04:27]** So my suggestion would be

**[04:29]** summon your Nori and just keep them safe in a big ball of units.

**[04:33]** Don't move them.

**[04:34]** Don't go adventuring with them.

**[04:36]** Just keep them at home where they're safe.

**[04:38]** If you do,

**[04:40]** unlike a lot of neutral monsters,

**[04:42]** they're going to pay for themselves really quickly.

**[04:43]** If you're able to have all three Nori in play,

**[04:47]** you're actually going to be netting doom pretty quickly.

**[04:50]** The second doom phase you control,

**[04:52]** all three you'll be actually up two doom

**[04:54]** from your initial investment of two doom earlier.

**[04:58]** What factions like these?

**[05:01]** Obviously,

**[05:02]** any ritual heavy engine factions are going to like these,

**[05:06]** but also a fighty faction is going to have an easier time

**[05:09]** defending these if they're part of a death ball.

**[05:12]** So honestly,

**[05:14]** this seems like a pretty solid monster,

**[05:15]** and I don't really see any faction that really doesn't want to keep these.

**[05:21]** And with that,

**[05:22]** we'll move on to our next neutral monster.

**[05:27]** Lang's almost humans fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighboring veils.

**[05:32]** And there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the moon,

**[05:36]** and of the submission of Lang's people to the polypus and amorphous blasphemes

**[05:40]** that hopped and floundered and wriggled out of them.

**[05:43]** Those slippery grayish-white blasphemes they worshipped as gods,

**[05:47]** nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males

**[05:50]** were taken away in the black galleys.

**[05:52]** The monstrous Moonbeast made their camp on a jagged isle in the sea,

**[05:57]** and Carter could tell from the frescas that this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had seen

**[06:02]** when sailing to Inganok,

**[06:05]** that gray accursed rock which Inganok's seamen shun,

**[06:09]** and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the night.

**[06:12]** And what you heard there was a little bit from the Dream Quest Unknown Kadath,

**[06:18]** and that is referencing our second unit,

**[06:21]** that is the Moonbeasts.

**[06:24]** I like the way the Moonbeasts look.

**[06:26]** It's very frog-like, toad-like,

**[06:28]** but their heads are all messed up.

**[06:31]** They don't have any eyes.

**[06:32]** Got some tentacles just like beaming up to the sky.

**[06:36]** Gross that people would want to worship them,

**[06:37]** but I mean, you do what you gotta do when you're in the Dreamlands.

**[06:40]** Yeah, very gross, very squat.

**[06:43]** Little petite sculpt here.

**[06:45]** I guess they made it that small so that it would be easier to fit on people's Spellbooks.

**[06:49]** More on that in a second.

**[06:51]** Get the Moonbeast.

**[06:52]** We are gonna have to pay 2 doom in the doom phase like everything else,

**[06:57]** and we'll take this loyalty card,

**[06:59]** and we'll place one Moonbeast on an enemy faction Spellbook

**[07:03]** rather than at one of our Gates.

**[07:06]** That's interesting right off the bat.

**[07:08]** We've got 4 Moonbeasts.

**[07:09]** They cost 2 Power to summon, and they have 0 combat.

**[07:13]** The ability on Moonbeast.

**[07:15]** Blasphemous obeisance.

**[07:16]** Ongoing ability.

**[07:18]** When a Moonbeast is summoned,

**[07:19]** place it on an enemy's faction Spellbook.

**[07:22]** While the Moonbeast is there,

**[07:23]** that player cannot use that Spellbook.

**[07:26]** It still counts for other purposes,

**[07:27]** such as unlimited battle and winning the game.

**[07:30]** The next doom phase.

**[07:32]** Place the Moonbeast on one of your Gates.

**[07:35]** A Moonbeast can be prematurely returned to the map

**[07:37]** if the victim spends one doom point at any time,

**[07:41]** not as an action.

**[07:42]** So the Moonbeast is by far the most complex and mean of the surface monsters here.

**[07:53]** Shutting off Spellbooks.

**[07:54]** A bit controversial.

**[07:56]** Some people are not really going to be able to stomach this.

**[08:00]** Personally, I think this is really cool,

**[08:02]** and I think I'd like to see more things like this in the game.

**[08:04]** But I'm acknowledging I'm very, very desensitized to this kind of thing.

**[08:09]** After playing 20 plus years of Magic the Gathering,

**[08:13]** playing 10 years competitively,

**[08:15]** if you play Magic,

**[08:17]** if you know the card Blood Moon,

**[08:19]** that's probably my favorite card.

**[08:21]** I've cast an untold amount of Blood Moons

**[08:24]** and locked a lot of people out of the game with Blood Moon

**[08:27]** and drank the tears of many, many people.

**[08:31]** So this unit doesn't really bother me one bit.

**[08:33]** But you might say this unit is kind of a griefy unit.

**[08:37]** I'd say no.

**[08:38]** I think Moonbeasts can be downright heroic

**[08:40]** if you deploy them at the right time on the right ability.

**[08:45]** It is free, or it won't cost you an action

**[08:48]** if you want to get rid of them early by paying a doom point.

**[08:51]** But nobody is really going to want to do this, right?

**[08:55]** Doom is just expensive to come by.

**[08:57]** You don't really want to give it away unless you need to.

**[08:59]** So you might find people waiting until the doom phase

**[09:03]** to return the Moonbeast to your Gate,

**[09:05]** and that's actually the best possible scenario for you

**[09:08]** because you'll be shutting off a Spellbook

**[09:10]** for hopefully the entire action phase.

**[09:13]** When you first take the Moonbeast loyalty card,

**[09:15]** you'll get a Moonbeast on somebody's Spellbook

**[09:18]** on their faction card.

**[09:20]** So we've got three left in the pool,

**[09:22]** and you've got two Power to summon each of them.

**[09:25]** So really you've got three other shots at three other Spellbooks.

**[09:29]** You could target the same person.

**[09:30]** You could target different people.

**[09:33]** Editing gram here, just another detail recording gram missed.

**[09:37]** There's nothing that says that you cannot put

**[09:40]** multiple Moonbeasts on the same Spellbook.

**[09:43]** So if you really don't want Crawling Chaos

**[09:46]** to have access to madness, for example,

**[09:48]** you could end up putting multiple Moonbeasts there.

**[09:51]** They would then have to pay multiple doom

**[09:54]** in order to actually get all of them off,

**[09:57]** or some combination of paying a doom,

**[09:59]** getting rid of one, waiting until the doom phase,

**[10:02]** getting rid of the other one.

**[10:03]** So there's definitely something to be said

**[10:05]** for going after the same person with multiple Moonbeasts

**[10:08]** or even going after the same Spellbook

**[10:10]** with multiple Moonbeasts.

**[10:11]** It could be even more mean,

**[10:13]** even more effective at shutting it off.

**[10:17]** The only way that you're going to be able to reuse Moonbeasts

**[10:20]** is by getting them killed somehow.

**[10:21]** So I would try to factor that into your plans

**[10:24]** if you are going to plan to try to shut somebody down

**[10:27]** the whole game on one Spellbook or a few Spellbooks.

**[10:31]** You're going to have to figure out a way

**[10:32]** to get your Moonbeasts killed

**[10:33]** when they put them back on the map.

**[10:36]** That's easier said than done.

**[10:37]** It will go to your controlled Gates.

**[10:39]** I actually think you'll be having a nice rattlesnake effect.

**[10:43]** If you do have Moonbeasts at your Gates

**[10:45]** and somebody shows up with a big army,

**[10:47]** you actually just want your Moonbeasts to get killed.

**[10:51]** Nice actually tool to defend your Gates.

**[10:53]** People aren't going to want to put them back in your pool.

**[10:56]** Don't recommend doing any doom phase Spellbooks

**[10:59]** because that's when the Moonbeasts will redeploy.

**[11:05]** I do think the turn order matters here actually.

**[11:08]** On your turn during the doom phase,

**[11:10]** when you have your opportunity to do a ritual,

**[11:12]** that's when Moonbeasts will redeploy.

**[11:14]** So the Moonbeast player might want to go

**[11:17]** after the doom phase Spellbooks.

**[11:18]** If they can somehow ensure they're going first

**[11:21]** and control the turn order,

**[11:23]** they can maybe deny you the use of your doom phase Spellbook too.

**[11:28]** Which factions like Moonbeasts?

**[11:30]** Again, that's not the question we should be asking.

**[11:34]** It's like which factions hate Moonbeasts the most?

**[11:36]** I mean really there's at least one or two books for every faction

**[11:40]** that they're going to be really miffed if you shut them off, right?

**[11:45]** Let's just go, we can just go over some Spellbooks

**[11:47]** that factions are really going to be mad if you turn them off.

**[11:49]** So for Crawling Chaos, there's like half of them.

**[11:53]** Madness, Thousand Forms, Emissary of the Outer Gods, all very annoying.

**[11:58]** Thulu's Submerge, Yellow Sign Screaming Dead or Third Eye,

**[12:04]** Hierophants on the Chocho, that seems very, very mean,

**[12:08]** and it's justice honestly.

**[12:11]** Any of these like very signature books

**[12:13]** that any faction is going to take as one of their first books,

**[12:17]** I think that's a great target for Moonbeasts.

**[12:19]** Try this one out if you haven't.

**[12:21]** I can see why some would never want to play with this unit.

**[12:25]** I find them quite fun.

**[12:26]** I would like to, as I've said in other episodes,

**[12:29]** play a really like masochistic game of Cthulhu Wars

**[12:32]** with all very mean neutral units

**[12:36]** and like Moonbeasts is nearly at the top of the list.

**[12:38]** So I'm a big fan, but I also enjoy prison strategies and magic

**[12:43]** and blocking people out of the game.

**[12:45]** So fun is a subjective thing.

**[12:47]** This is something I find fun and I totally respect

**[12:50]** if you don't also find this fun.

**[12:53]** And with that, we can move on to the final neutral monster.

**[12:57]** It was only the flickering light of the clouds

**[13:00]** that made their mitered double heads seem to move.

**[13:03]** But as Carter stumbled on,

**[13:05]** he saw a rise from their shadowy laps great forms

**[13:08]** whose motions were no delusion.

**[13:11]** Winged and whirring,

**[13:12]** those forms grew larger each moment

**[13:14]** and the traveler knew his stumbling was at an end.

**[13:17]** They were not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth

**[13:20]** or in dreamland,

**[13:21]** for they were larger than elephants

**[13:23]** and had heads like a horse's.

**[13:26]** Carter knew they must be the Shantak birds of ill rumor

**[13:28]** and wondered no more what evil guardians

**[13:31]** and nameless sentinels

**[13:32]** made men avoid the boreal rock desert.

**[13:34]** And the third monster we'll be discussing

**[13:39]** is the Shantak,

**[13:41]** as you heard there with another little bit

**[13:43]** from the Dream Quest Unknown Kadath.

**[13:47]** It's looking pretty dragon-like, honestly.

**[13:50]** I can see the horse head.

**[13:52]** It's got some big wings.

**[13:54]** They don't look feathered.

**[13:56]** They look more bat-like.

**[13:58]** It's perched on a rock,

**[13:59]** not unlike a Nightgaunt,

**[14:01]** which you can also find in the underworld

**[14:03]** in the Dreamlands, I guess.

**[14:05]** Got a bit of a mean face

**[14:06]** when I look really closely, too.

**[14:08]** Don't want to try to domesticate one of these.

**[14:13]** To get the Shantaks,

**[14:15]** we will be paying two Doom in the Doom phase

**[14:17]** to get their loyalty card

**[14:18]** and we'll place one Shantak at our controlled Gate.

**[14:22]** We have two of them.

**[14:23]** They cost two Power to summon

**[14:24]** and they have two combat.

**[14:26]** The ability on Shantaks is Horber Steed.

**[14:29]** It's an ongoing ability.

**[14:32]** When moving a Shantak,

**[14:33]** it can reach any area on the map.

**[14:35]** In addition,

**[14:36]** the Shantak may carry one of your Cultists

**[14:38]** with it for free.

**[14:40]** Yeah, wow,

**[14:40]** Horber Steed is a very, very strong ability.

**[14:44]** The best kind of movement you can ask for

**[14:46]** is when you can move literally anywhere you want.

**[14:49]** You might feel that way

**[14:50]** with the Flight ability sometimes

**[14:52]** playing Crawling Chaos,

**[14:53]** but this one is actually moving anywhere.

**[14:56]** Not only that,

**[14:57]** you can bring a Cultist along for free,

**[14:58]** which is a nice way to save on Power.

**[15:02]** I really like this one.

**[15:04]** There tends to be,

**[15:05]** over the course of a game,

**[15:06]** one or more skirmishes

**[15:08]** at a Gate that might be more remote

**[15:10]** from other areas in the map

**[15:12]** where both sides might have either

**[15:13]** completely died

**[15:14]** or got completely pained out.

**[15:16]** If that happens

**[15:17]** and you have the Shantak in an area

**[15:20]** with one of your Acolytes

**[15:21]** that's not hanging out on a Gate,

**[15:23]** you can just swoop in for a single Power.

**[15:25]** You already have a two combat monster

**[15:28]** and a Cultist to take control of the Gate

**[15:30]** right away.

**[15:31]** I think that's really nice.

**[15:33]** Not uncommon to have,

**[15:35]** you know,

**[15:35]** one or more abandoned Gates

**[15:37]** at the end of the action phase.

**[15:39]** If you're ever able to stall a little bit,

**[15:41]** you can really clean up on these.

**[15:43]** If you have,

**[15:44]** you know,

**[15:44]** both your Shantaks hanging around

**[15:45]** with an Acolyte to carry,

**[15:47]** you can really quickly move into position

**[15:49]** right at the end of the action phase

**[15:50]** when players can't really do much to stop you.

**[15:53]** Which factions like this?

**[15:56]** I honestly think every faction would like this.

**[15:59]** Maybe only the most turtley factions

**[16:01]** that want to stay close by

**[16:03]** might like it a little bit less,

**[16:05]** but being able to act

**[16:07]** toward the end of the action phase

**[16:09]** and go after some remote Gate

**[16:12]** that's been cleared out

**[16:13]** and abandoned for whatever reason

**[16:15]** is going to be really, really handy.

**[16:17]** Anybody's going to want to do that.

**[16:18]** Claiming that Gate,

**[16:20]** claiming that doom in the doom phase,

**[16:22]** everybody's going to like this.

**[16:23]** I don't really have any

**[16:24]** particular recommendation here.

**[16:28]** If there's like a random lineup

**[16:30]** of neutral monsters

**[16:31]** and the Shantaks are among them,

**[16:33]** I'm thinking the Shantaks

**[16:34]** are probably in the top one or two

**[16:36]** that you should ever buy

**[16:37]** if they're available

**[16:38]** just because of the insane

**[16:40]** movement potential here.

**[16:42]** Yeah, buy them if you can

**[16:44]** because they are a hot, hot pick.

**[16:48]** And with that,

**[16:48]** I think we've made it

**[16:49]** to the end of the episode.

**[16:50]** This one's going to be short and sweet,

**[16:53]** but I hope you enjoyed.

**[16:54]** I hope you enjoyed my sprinkling

**[16:57]** of the lore in here.

**[16:59]** I know some people don't prefer it.

**[17:01]** I've got some feedback on that,

**[17:02]** but I do.

**[17:03]** I like it.

**[17:04]** I like mentioning the stories here.

**[17:05]** I'm going to keep rolling with that.

**[17:07]** Definitely read the Dreamlance.

**[17:09]** It's quite long,

**[17:10]** but it is pretty interesting

**[17:12]** and cool.

**[17:12]** Very interesting setting.

**[17:14]** What a great crop of neutral units.

**[17:17]** I think I've been a little critical

**[17:20]** of neutral monsters in the past

**[17:21]** because I don't enjoy

**[17:22]** that you have to pay the two Doom

**[17:24]** in order to obtain them,

**[17:26]** but frankly,

**[17:27]** all of these ones are pretty solid

**[17:30]** and I wouldn't be unhappy

**[17:31]** buying any of them.

**[17:33]** The Nori are going to pay for themselves

**[17:35]** and in some ways,

**[17:36]** the Shantak is going to help pay

**[17:38]** for itself pretty quickly too

**[17:39]** when you're able to claim

**[17:40]** a random Gate with it.

**[17:42]** And the Moonbeast,

**[17:44]** though you're not going to be getting

**[17:45]** paid back Doom in any way,

**[17:48]** the taxing other factions

**[17:49]** possibly on their Doom

**[17:51]** is going to be worthwhile

**[17:52]** for sure.

**[17:53]** If they don't pay Doom

**[17:54]** to get rid of the Moonbeast,

**[17:56]** they're going to have to wait it out

**[17:57]** and shut off their books

**[17:58]** and that's got to be worth

**[17:59]** at least a couple of Doom

**[18:00]** over the course of the game.

**[18:02]** I really like all of these.

**[18:03]** If you've never played with them,

**[18:05]** definitely check them out.

**[18:07]** Get them in the rotation.

**[18:08]** I think they're all very strong.

**[18:11]** That's another episode in the book,

**[18:12]** so thank you for listening.
