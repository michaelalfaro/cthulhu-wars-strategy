## Transcript

**[00:00]** There, in the gray beginning of earth, the formless mass that was Ubo-Sothla reposed

**[00:07]** amid the slime and the vapors.

**[00:10]** Headless, without organs or members, it sloughed from its oozy sides in a slow, ceaseless wave

**[00:17]** with amoebic forms that were the archetypes of earthly life.

**[00:23]** Horrible it was, if there had been aught to apprehend the horror, and loathsome, there

**[00:28]** had been any to feel loathing.

**[00:30]** About it, prone or tilted in the mire, there lay the mighty tablets of star-quarried stone

**[00:36]** that were writ with the inconceivable wisdom of the pre-mundane gods.

**[00:41]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:04]** I'm Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[01:06]** Hope you're doing well.

**[01:08]** I'm recording on a Friday morning before work, looking forward to the weekend.

**[01:14]** I'm recording this on May 5th, and I'm going to try to stick to my monthly release schedule

**[01:20]** as much as I can, but I'm just acknowledging that next weekend the new Legend of Zelda

**[01:25]** game comes out, and I am beyond excited for that one, because I thought that Breath of

**[01:30]** the Wild was one of the best games that's ever been made, one of my favorite games that

**[01:35]** I've ever played.

**[01:36]** So yeah, I can't believe that they're making a sequel to it, and it's finally here after

**[01:40]** some number of years.

**[01:42]** What are we talking about in today's episode?

**[01:46]** We are doing another faction overview, this time on the Cho-Cho faction.

**[01:52]** You heard there in the intro was a bit from the story Ubo-Sothla, and that was written

**[01:58]** by Clark Ashton Smith.

**[02:02]** You'll be hearing more about him because there's actually quite a bit of content from

**[02:07]** Cthulhu Wars that comes from his writing.

**[02:11]** The Cho-Cho are a tribe of cannibals, and they have pretty much found a Great Old One,

**[02:20]** Ubo-Sothla, that they're going to use for their own ends.

**[02:24]** It's sort of like the opposite of the way their relationship usually goes with the Great

**[02:28]** Old One.

**[02:29]** The Cho-Cho Cultists seem to be using Ubo and not the other way around.

**[02:36]** Let's talk about the faction a little bit.

**[02:38]** I'd say this is one of the premier engine factions in Cthulhu Wars, for sure, before

**[02:45]** Demon and Sultan and Katz got on the scene.

**[02:48]** This was the faction if you wanted to get a lot of doom and do it quickly and not really

**[02:55]** interact with your opponents so much.

**[02:57]** The Cho-Chos were the way to go.

**[03:01]** This one feels a bit like the Insane Clown Posse, if I can make that comparison.

**[03:05]** It feels like people are not into the Cho-Cho just a little bit.

**[03:10]** There's no middle ground.

**[03:11]** You either love the Cho-Cho and they're one of your favorite factions, or you rarely or

**[03:17]** ever play the Cho's.

**[03:20]** I fall a bit into the latter category, not because I dislike this faction, it's just

**[03:24]** sort of not my cup of tea, and that's okay.

**[03:29]** We're here today because we want to understand this faction, fully understand how it works.

**[03:36]** I'd say, importantly, how to play against this one as well.

**[03:39]** This is another, I'd say, classical villain faction, definitely.

**[03:43]** You are not the good guys if you play this faction, so you shouldn't feel offended when

**[03:49]** people come after you, and likewise, if you're playing against the Cho-Cho, you shouldn't

**[03:54]** feel bad for picking on them.

**[03:55]** They really do deserve it.

**[03:58]** As I've said in other episodes, I didn't really get familiar with Cthulhu Wars until like

**[04:02]** 2019.

**[04:03]** I think that was at least a couple years after the initial iteration of Cho-Cho came out,

**[04:09]** and it seems like, reading around the internet, this is not some people's favorite faction.

**[04:15]** A lot of the complaints are this faction is linear, that it's not very interactive with

**[04:20]** the other players.

**[04:21]** Is it like a self-indulgent faction?

**[04:26]** I think so, but I also think that's okay.

**[04:29]** I think there's room for a faction like that in Cthulhu Wars.

**[04:34]** The main complaint is that this faction doesn't really do stuff with the other players.

**[04:38]** It just wants to quote-unquote turtle up behind a couple of Gates and ritual into the wind.

**[04:46]** That is a flavor of playing Cthulhu Wars.

**[04:48]** Like it or not, it's part of the game, so we're here to understand the Cho's and how

**[04:54]** to use them and how to be good with them.

**[04:59]** This is another faction, if you look away, they can explode and get a lot of doom if

**[05:06]** you're not paying close attention to them and monitoring how much doom they can get

**[05:11]** or planning ahead to sort of math out how much doom they can potentially get in the

**[05:16]** next turn.

**[05:17]** If you can't do that, you are going to lose a lot of games to the Cho-Cho, but I'm here

**[05:21]** to try to make it so everyone has a pretty full understanding of this faction.

**[05:30]** Another characteristic of the Cho-Cho, and we'll discuss more about it, is they actually

**[05:35]** have high priests built into their faction.

**[05:39]** Maybe it was an oversight on my part in the high priest episode not to talk about the

**[05:43]** Cho-Chos there, but I felt like it would be detracting too much from the bite-sized

**[05:48]** nature I was going for in that episode.

**[05:51]** But yeah, high priest, where they come from, it's this faction, and so the games are going

**[05:56]** to be different with and without high priest expansion being used if the Cho-Cho are in

**[06:02]** the game.

**[06:03]** That's something to keep in mind.

**[06:07]** It's 2023, and now when we play the Cho-Chos, we have some options.

**[06:14]** Depending on how you count it, several more fractions of a faction for Cho-Chos in Onslaught

**[06:22]** 4 in the Cho-Cho tribes.

**[06:26]** Let's go over the rules for playing the tribes.

**[06:28]** When you begin play as the Cho-Chos, choose your tribe, who you're available, Lang, Sarcomand,

**[06:33]** or Sang.

**[06:35]** Don't choose Sarcomand unless the game has neutral grade old ones and monsters.

**[06:40]** Lang and Sang are okay in any game.

**[06:44]** All tribes use the normal Cho-Cho faction board and all share three universal Spellbooks,

**[06:49]** Pyrofance, Solace, and Terror.

**[06:52]** However, each tribe has three Spellbooks unique to it.

**[06:56]** For Sang, these are the same as the old books.

**[06:58]** This is the Cho-Cho tribe that you've played.

**[07:01]** If you've never heard of tribes, you've been playing Sang this whole time.

**[07:04]** Lang and Sarcomand tribes each have three Spellbooks that we've never seen before.

**[07:09]** On the backs of the Spellbooks, the universal ones all read Cho-Cho all on the back.

**[07:14]** The three for each of the tribes will read Cho-Cho and then the specific tribe on the

**[07:18]** back.

**[07:19]** So at the start of the game, you take your three tribal Spellbooks and you place them

**[07:24]** by your faction board underneath your universal Spellbooks.

**[07:28]** You do not need to show them to the other players.

**[07:32]** I like that they use this word.

**[07:33]** Vertively put the six unused Spellbooks, the two unchosen tribes, back into the box so

**[07:39]** they can't be inspected and the other players don't know what tribe you've picked.

**[07:43]** When you gain a Spellbook, you can choose any of your six available Spellbooks.

**[07:47]** One of the three universal books or one of your tribal books.

**[07:51]** You do not need to announce which tribe you belong to until you play one of the tribal

**[07:55]** Spellbooks, at which point you won't be able to hide it any longer.

**[08:00]** I like this.

**[08:01]** So a little bit of a head games thing going on.

**[08:03]** If you do have somebody who is a Cho-Cho player, they will get a chance to kind of

**[08:08]** juke a little bit.

**[08:10]** You won't really know what they're going to play until they take their tribal Spellbook.

**[08:17]** I want to dedicate this guide to my friend Matt, Lord Momo.

**[08:21]** He loves the Bubblegum Boys.

**[08:23]** Unfortunately, he's also moving away, I've learned.

**[08:27]** He'll be missed.

**[08:28]** Hopefully we can play Cthulhu Wars online, but he does like him some Cho-Cho, so this

**[08:34]** guide's for you, Matt.

**[08:36]** Enjoy.

**[08:37]** How am I going to structure this guide since we're kind of doing, you know, 1.5 factions?

**[08:45]** I'm going to try to make blanket statements about the Cho's and break it into sections

**[08:50]** that way, and then I'll do like tribal-specific sections.

**[08:53]** So hopefully it flows well.

**[08:56]** This episode's going to be a doozy, I think Editing Graham is going to have his work cut

**[08:59]** out for him.

**[09:00]** Sorry, Editing Graham.

**[09:03]** Let's go over the Cho-Cho setup.

**[09:06]** After all other players have setup except Opener and Windwalker, Cho's get six acolytes

**[09:12]** and a controlled Gate in an empty area containing a faction glyph.

**[09:17]** Set Ubosathla's growth counter to zero on the Doom Track, or on that later.

**[09:23]** Note that the Cho-Cho can setup in one of Windwalker's starting areas, in which case

**[09:26]** Windwalker is forced to setup in the other one.

**[09:30]** Recommend avoiding this if possible because it will give Windwalker a Spellbook right

**[09:34]** away.

**[09:35]** In an 8-player game, this might be unavoidable, but what are you doing playing Cho-Cho in

**[09:38]** an 8-player game, you know?

**[09:42]** If the High Priest expansion is in use, replace one acolyte with a High Priest.

**[09:49]** So they'll have a starting Gate, five acolytes, and a High Priest.

**[09:55]** Note that this doesn't give them an extra High Priest, they still only have three.

**[09:58]** The High Priest expansion is also going to change the way the Cho-Cho's Hierophant Spellbook

**[10:03]** is played, so more on that later.

**[10:07]** Should I have talked about Cho-Cho at all during the High Priest episode?

**[10:11]** Was that a mistake not to?

**[10:12]** Sorry if you were hoping that I would.

**[10:15]** Rest assured, we will be talking about the High Priest expansion with and without quite

**[10:18]** a bit in this episode, I'm sure.

**[10:22]** And the other thing you need to know about the setup is any other factions that have

**[10:25]** like a variable setup, like Opener of the Way, they should be playing with their, probably

**[10:30]** have a cardboard faction glyph token that's included with yours that usually live in the

**[10:35]** box.

**[10:36]** You do want to have it on the map, and this is because of their idolatry Spellbook, which

**[10:40]** we'll talk more about later.

**[10:42]** Okay, the unique faction ability for Cho-Chos is Sycophancy.

**[10:49]** In the Doom phase, when an enemy player performs a Ritual of Annihilation, they can give Cho-Cho

**[10:54]** one Doom, or they earn one less for the ritual.

**[10:59]** Low key, pretty strong faction ability here.

**[11:03]** It's pretty mean.

**[11:04]** I'm thinking most of the time, like 90% of the time, if you have to pay the Sycophancy

**[11:11]** tax, just take one less Doom.

**[11:14]** You don't really want to give Doom to the Cho-Cho because they're the most thirsty Doom

**[11:18]** faction that you've ever seen.

**[11:20]** Don't give them any Doom unless it's absolutely necessary or you have a huge lead over them

**[11:25]** already.

**[11:26]** More on this in the sleeper guide, but I would also put Sycophancy up there among the top

**[11:34]** tier abilities to copy with Ancient Sorcery.

**[11:38]** If you've ever seen two Sycophancies at the same time, it's pretty mean.

**[11:44]** If there's a lot of other factions that like to ritual in the game, it's very, very mean.

**[11:49]** Okay, the Spellbook requirements for the Cho-Chos.

**[11:55]** First two, sort of, I'll talk about them as a group.

**[11:57]** The first one is earn an Elder Sign, and the second one is own three or more Elder Signs.

**[12:03]** As I said at the top, this faction loves to ritual maybe more than any other faction,

**[12:09]** so it's pretty straightforward to get both of these.

**[12:14]** Earn an Elder Sign, you've got absolutely no excuse for not earning this Spellbook here

**[12:18]** because you're going to be doing at least one ritual during the game.

**[12:22]** Own three or more Elder Signs, yeah, you should be doing multiple rituals.

**[12:26]** In addition to this, each tribe has a way of obtaining extra Elder Signs.

**[12:30]** So for Sang Tribe, that's going to be Tablet of the Gods, and for Lang Tribe, that's going

**[12:38]** to be Fulmination.

**[12:39]** For the Sarcomand Tribe, that's going to be the Inerrant Spellbook.

**[12:43]** More on that later.

**[12:46]** So the point is, yeah, these two requirements are pretty simple to meet.

**[12:51]** If you're doing it right, you should have no trouble getting both of these.

**[12:57]** Third requirement, another faction performs a ritual or has 15 doom.

**[13:03]** Given that you have Sycophancy as your ability, players are maybe going to want to ritual

**[13:08]** less often, so you might not get that triggering early from a ritual.

**[13:14]** But if you're in a close game, players are going to get to 15 doom, so this is another

**[13:19]** book you're more or less guaranteed to get if the game is going any kind of normal direction.

**[13:26]** Not too much else to say on this one.

**[13:29]** Another requirement, any Great Old One is killed in battle, almost a guarantee to happen

**[13:34]** in a game of Cthulhu Wars.

**[13:36]** You might not be the one doing the killing yourself, more on that later, but your Great

**[13:41]** Old One is actually pretty nice to get killed because you have a nice, easy way to awaken

**[13:46]** Uboslothla cheaply in the doom phase, but I don't recommend a suicide mission with your

**[13:53]** Great Old One necessarily.

**[13:54]** You do want to have it on the doom phase specifically, and we'll break down why that is.

**[14:01]** Fifth requirement, as an action, remove your controlled Gate in your start area.

**[14:06]** On the Primeval and Shaggai maps, you can remove any of your controlled Gates.

**[14:12]** This is another Spellbook that seems pretty easy to earn, but the real question is when

**[14:17]** to earn it, right?

**[14:19]** You could do it really early on, like in action phase one, but if you do, you're giving up

**[14:24]** on recruiting a high priest or something that might bolster how much Power or doom that

**[14:30]** you're going to get.

**[14:32]** You could use this defensively at some point if somebody moves into your Gate, but before

**[14:37]** they have unlimited combat, you can blow up your Gate.

**[14:40]** That might make them a little bit sad.

**[14:42]** Just be careful.

**[14:43]** You don't want to lose control of your starting Gate or you won't be able to do what I'm suggesting,

**[14:49]** which is kind of like use this Spellbook requirement as a bit of a benefit and not just a cost.

**[14:57]** Awaken Uboslothla is your last Spellbook requirement.

**[15:00]** Super easy.

**[15:01]** You're going to do this one in the doom phase.

**[15:03]** We'll break down exactly what you're doing in the first doom phase.

**[15:06]** It's a very specific order of operations.

**[15:09]** This one is very easy.

**[15:11]** Overall, I think the Chochos have a very, very easy time earning all their books, and

**[15:16]** I think that is another reason why they're seen as one of the stronger factions.

**[15:21]** They're all very straightforward requirements, and if you're paying attention and you know

**[15:26]** what you're doing as a faction, you're going to have no issue earning all of these every

**[15:30]** game.

**[15:31]** You might even be one of the first players to have all of your books.

**[15:36]** Let's go over the units for Chocho.

**[15:39]** Starting with the Acolytes.

**[15:41]** I like these ones.

**[15:42]** They're cannibals, so they are just like guys in robes, look a little bit like monks, but

**[15:48]** yeah, they're holding a nice skull over the head.

**[15:51]** Not like in a Shakespearean Last Poor York kind of way, but in like a I just ate this

**[15:58]** guy kind of way.

**[16:00]** Kind of spooky.

**[16:01]** The Spellbook that works with the Acolytes is soulless, and that basically makes it so

**[16:06]** that they don't provide any Power when they're captured.

**[16:09]** Kind of a nice rattlesnake Spellbook we'll talk more about.

**[16:14]** And the Chocho, like I mentioned earlier, they actually have another kind of Cultist,

**[16:19]** and it's one that you'll be familiar with if you listened to the High Priest episode.

**[16:22]** That is High Priest.

**[16:23]** They have three of them built into their faction.

**[16:27]** Just to recap High Priest, they cost three to recruit, they don't have any combat, and

**[16:34]** they have the ability Unspeakable Oath.

**[16:36]** At the end of any player's action, even if it's not your turn, you can sacrifice your

**[16:40]** High Priest back into your pool to gain two Power.

**[16:44]** This can also be done during Gather Power phase or Doom phase or even in the first player

**[16:49]** phase if you want to try to pop your High Priest and steal first player from somebody.

**[16:55]** Having three High Priests is pretty spicy.

**[16:59]** Go listen to the High Priest episode to hear more about them in depth.

**[17:02]** When you're out of Power, you can pop your High Priest and jump back into the game if

**[17:06]** necessary.

**[17:08]** So if Chocho have all three, if they really want to, after all the players are out of

**[17:12]** Power, they have potentially six Power they can wake up with.

**[17:17]** Even four Power is enough to, you know, move and build a Gate, and that might be all that

**[17:22]** the Chocho really need to do.

**[17:24]** So yeah, it's very dangerous that this faction has three High Priests instead of just one.

**[17:29]** It's one of their defining characteristics, and there's a lot of ways that you can use

**[17:34]** your High Priest depending on which tribe you are.

**[17:38]** We've got Martyrdom from the Sang tribe.

**[17:42]** We've got Dark Rituals from the Leng tribe, and the Sarcomand tribe, they don't even really

**[17:48]** care about High Priest that much because they're too caught up in having all their books work

**[17:52]** with neutrals.

**[17:55]** The next unit for the Chochos, we have the only monster for them, the Proto-Shogoths.

**[18:02]** You got six of them, they cost two Power to summon, and they got a combat of one.

**[18:06]** This is one of my favorite sculpts in the whole game.

**[18:10]** It kind of reminds me of—I had to look this one up, I couldn't remember what the character's

**[18:17]** name was—Obelina from the Real Monsters Nickelodeon show from back in the day.

**[18:22]** I'm dating myself.

**[18:24]** The Proto-Shogoth is just disgusting.

**[18:26]** It looks like a lot of limbs and eyes, and there's some teeth going on.

**[18:31]** If you look closely, the best detail of this sculpt is it is actually bursting out of somebody's

**[18:36]** chest on the ground.

**[18:38]** There's a dead body that's bursting out of them, like a xenomorph.

**[18:41]** I'm a big fan of Alien, the Ridley Scott franchise, so, oh yeah, I love how the Proto-Shogoth

**[18:47]** looks.

**[18:49]** The Spellbook that works with Protos is Terror, where you can either add one combat die per

**[18:56]** Proto-Shogoth before the battle, or you can subtract one from the enemy's dice before

**[19:02]** combat for every Proto-Shogoth that you have.

**[19:07]** Last unit for Cho-Chos, we have Ubo-Sothla, the Great Old One.

**[19:12]** Last six, Power to Awaken, there's a little asterisk there, and Combat of Zero, another

**[19:19]** asterisk.

**[19:21]** Let's go over the Awakening requirements right away.

**[19:25]** you must have a controlled Gate and a high priest in play, doesn't need to be

**[19:30]** at the Gate, during the doom phase or the action phase. Number two, if it's the

**[19:35]** doom phase, pay zero Power. If it's the action phase, pay six Power. Number three,

**[19:41]** eliminate the high priest, then place Ubo Sofla at your controlled Gate. Combat

**[19:47]** for Ubo equals the growth counter on the Doom Track, and the ability on Ubo is

**[19:55]** Hell's Banquet. During the doom phase, once Ubo Sofla has been awakened, starting

**[20:00]** with the following doom phase and whether or not Ubo Sofla is still in play,

**[20:04]** roll one d6 and increase its growth counter by the die roll. So the first

**[20:10]** doom phase, you awaken Ubo, it will have zero combat, but it will grow over the

**[20:15]** game slowly or quickly, depending on your rolls. So if you're like me, it's

**[20:20]** gonna roll really, really few combat dice for the entire game, but maybe you're

**[20:25]** not like me and Ubo can become a full-on monster that rolls like 15 to 20 dice

**[20:31]** by the end of the game. Let's quickly talk about the ability to awaken your

**[20:36]** great old one in the doom phase. I recommend doing this like 95% of the

**[20:41]** time awakening during the doom phase of the move. You're just saving a lot of

**[20:45]** Power. Yes, you have to give up a high priest, but you figure high priests are

**[20:50]** only three Power to recruit, so assuming you have a high priest, it's always

**[20:54]** better to awaken this way because you're only really spending three Power as

**[20:59]** opposed to six Power. In addition to this, the order of events in the doom phase is

**[21:04]** all at the same time, so you can awaken Ubo, get a spell book, and still ritual

**[21:11]** That's gonna be key. We'll talk more about that in the openings for Cho-Cho

**[21:16]** section, I guess. You really do want to be awakening in the doom phase. It's just

**[21:20]** cheaper. You'll see why. It's just good tempo to do things in the doom phase and

**[21:26]** not wait to do it in the action phase. So yeah, new Cho-Cho players, take note.

**[21:31]** If you're awakening in the action phase, you're probably doing it wrong. You need

**[21:34]** a really good reason not to awaken in the doom phase.

**[21:41]** Alright, the next part of the guide, we're gonna try to do universal spell

**[21:45]** books, then we'll do universal openings, general tips for warding the Cho's, and

**[21:51]** then we'll break it down by tribe. Starting on the universal spell books,

**[21:55]** first we have Soulless. It's an ongoing ability. When captured and sacrificed,

**[22:01]** your Cultists provide zero Power instead of the normal one Power. Not too much to

**[22:07]** say on this one. It's a nice rattlesnake ability, just making it less desirable to

**[22:11]** capture Cho-Cho Cultists. You are actually gonna have a lot of Cultists

**[22:16]** among your Gates because you've also got the high priests. Savvy opponents here,

**[22:21]** basically they would rather battle you away than capture you, and that's fine.

**[22:26]** One trick you can do is, like, don't take Soulless right away. Let your opponents

**[22:32]** capture your Cultists or let them think that they're gonna get Power from it.

**[22:35]** Then you can take Soulless before the gather Power phase. That way they will

**[22:41]** have wasted some, quote-unquote, wasted some Power capturing you, and they're not

**[22:45]** actually gonna get anything out of it except maybe a Gate. Second spell book is

**[22:50]** Terror. It is a pre-battle ability. Choose one. Your enemy's combat total is reduced

**[22:56]** by one per proto-shogoth in the battle, or two, your combat total is increased by

**[23:02]** one per proto-shogoth in the battle. When to do one versus the other, you'll have

**[23:08]** to kind of figure that out for yourself, but I'd say generally if you've got less

**[23:13]** units in the area you might want to subtract from the enemy, or if you have a

**[23:18]** specific unit you want to kill, like another great old one, and you do have

**[23:22]** multiple protos in the battle, you might want to roll more dice. If you only have

**[23:29]** a couple, like one or two protos in the battle, it might not even really matter

**[23:32]** that much, but once we're talking like three or four protos, that's when this

**[23:37]** decision becomes like a little bit more meaningful.

**[23:42]** And the last universal spell book is Hierophant's ongoing ability. When you

**[23:48]** earn a faction spell book, including this one, place a high priest at one of your

**[23:51]** Gates. If there's no high priest in your pool, instead advance Ubo's growth

**[23:56]** counter by one. When this spell book is first taken, if you're using the high

**[24:00]** priest expansion, then all factions place a high priest at one of their Gates. This

**[24:07]** is your most important spell book. If you're not playing with high priest, I

**[24:11]** would take this first every single time. When you are playing with high priest, it

**[24:16]** becomes a little bit more of a consideration because you do need to

**[24:19]** give a free high priest to the other players, and that's actually like pretty

**[24:23]** significant. Over the course of the game, this book represents six potential free

**[24:29]** high priests, and that's why you should always get this pretty early. If you take

**[24:34]** it any later, you're losing out on free units. Another thing to keep in mind is

**[24:40]** managing your high priest count as you earn your spell books here. Keep in mind

**[24:45]** you're earning one when you get this book, but for every subsequent book. You

**[24:49]** don't want to have all three of your high priests in play when you earn a

**[24:52]** spell book because you won't get a new one. You'll just advance Ubo's growth

**[24:56]** counter by one, which I don't really think is worth it most of the time, but

**[24:59]** it's easy enough to just pop your high priest and avoid that from ever

**[25:04]** happening. With the high priest expansion in use, there's some big implications for

**[25:09]** this book, right? All the other factions will get a high priest whenever you earn

**[25:13]** any of your spell books, including and after Hierophant, so you may not want to

**[25:19]** take Hierophant's first thing. Imagine everything I just said about the six

**[25:24]** potential free high priests, but it applies to the other players as well.

**[25:27]** They would love to get 12 Power worth of high priest Power over the game. You'll

**[25:34]** have to try to figure that out depending on the faction mix. For example, Crawling

**[25:39]** Chaos is in the game, and it's the second action phase when they plan

**[25:43]** to awaken. You don't want to take Hierophant in the first doom phase and

**[25:49]** give them high priest so that they can awaken Narlathotep and use Thousand

**[25:53]** Forms. You don't want to do that. This next section, I'm going to do my best to

**[25:59]** just generally give you some advice on how to do some openings with the

**[26:04]** Cho-Cho. First thing that's worth talking about in openings would be that setup

**[26:09]** location, since it is variable. The only other faction we've talked about so far

**[26:14]** with a variable setup was Demon Sultan, and it depended a lot on what other

**[26:19]** factions were in the game. If you're playing as the Cho's, I'd say it doesn't

**[26:24]** matter that much. Generally, this faction really does want to be left alone, so

**[26:29]** wherever you can set up that is the farthest away from the other players so

**[26:34]** they have to spend the most Power getting to you, that's kind of what you

**[26:37]** want to be doing. For example, one of my favorite places to set up if Windwalker

**[26:42]** is not in the game would be that Antarctica location, because it's pretty

**[26:45]** isolated. In the first action phase, there's really two things that you can

**[26:53]** do. You can either build a second Gate, or you can get an extra high priest. If you

**[26:59]** don't build a Gate, you could do two high priests and a proto shogoth at your

**[27:03]** starting Gate, or you could move, build a Gate, recruit a high priest, and move to

**[27:10]** the newly Gated area. So here we're not going to have any monsters, but we will

**[27:16]** have multiple Cultists on each Gate. Assuming there's not a crawling

**[27:21]** chaos or somebody next to you, you can probably get away with not having a

**[27:25]** monster on either one of your Gates. Bonus third opening for Cho-Cho, if you

**[27:31]** really want to rush for your Spellbooks as soon as possible, would be give up

**[27:35]** that starting Gate Spellbook requirement and take Hierophant. That'll get you a

**[27:39]** high priest, and you'll still have 8 Power to work with. You could rebuild your

**[27:43]** starting Gate, and then you either can have something more similar to either

**[27:48]** one of those other openings I mentioned. You're either on one Gate with multiple

**[27:52]** high priests and a proto shogoth, or you're on two Gates and they're not very

**[27:56]** well defended. Every doom matters for Cho-Cho, so I like creating a second Gate,

**[28:05]** but just keep in mind if you're playing with people that know what they're doing,

**[28:08]** they're gonna be really unhappy with you immediately for going for this greedy

**[28:12]** opening, and they might come after you sooner because of that. No matter what

**[28:18]** you do in action phase one, make sure you have at least one high priest before the

**[28:23]** doom phase. This is because, like I was saying, you want to awaken Ubo in the

**[28:28]** first doom phase the vast majority of the time. You could pay and awaken Ubo in

**[28:34]** the action phase, but I really don't think you want to be doing that unless

**[28:37]** something disastrous happened. Let's just walk through your first doom phase as

**[28:44]** the Cho-Cho, and I do think this one is pretty scripted. You're gonna have a high

**[28:49]** priest at the end of your first action phase if you're doing it right. You're

**[28:54]** gonna pay zero Power, and you're gonna awaken Ubo. At this point you've

**[28:59]** earned a Spellbook. Most likely you're gonna take Hierophant, and you'll get a

**[29:05]** high priest to replace the one that you just gave up for

**[29:07]** awakening your great old one. At this point you can also still ritual, so you should. You're going

**[29:15]** to get another one or two doom depending on how many Gates you have, but more importantly

**[29:19]** you'll earn an Elder Sign, so you'll get another spell book there. And because you probably took

**[29:25]** Hierophant, you'll get a second high priest. So in action phase two you're probably going to start

**[29:30]** with Hugo Sofla. You're not going to be on a lot of Power, maybe three or five Power post ritual.

**[29:37]** You're going to be on one or two Gates and you're going to be on like two high priests

**[29:41]** and a bunch of acolytes, so that's actually a pretty good spot to be in. In action phase two

**[29:47]** at this point people are going to be taking the turn off to awaken their great old ones. It's

**[29:52]** pretty safe to just recruit a third high priest and call it a day. You have potential to pop a

**[29:58]** couple of high priests and build another Gate after everybody else is out of Power. That's

**[30:02]** definitely a thing you can do. The other thing to keep in mind, which I should definitely emphasize

**[30:08]** I don't really think I did that earlier in the guide, is high priests are Cultists. They do

**[30:12]** provide you Power during gather Power. If you're on one Gate and you have two high priests and all

**[30:19]** of your acolytes, that's still pretty nice. You're still going to be on 10 Power. Any Gates in excess

**[30:23]** of that you're doing actively good I would say. If you're on like 10 or 12 Power that's a great

**[30:28]** spot to be in going into the next doom phase. After the first doom phase I don't really have

**[30:34]** too much else on general opening advice. You're going to be getting some of your Spellbooks pretty

**[30:41]** quickly, so from here you just need to keep up that doom tempo. You're going to need to ritual

**[30:46]** and use your tribal Spellbooks in order to earn that three Elder Sign Spellbook requirement.

**[30:52]** That's probably your hardest one to earn, and fill out the rest of your Spellbooks.

**[30:57]** A lot of these other things that we've mentioned, your other requirements, they're just going to

**[31:01]** happen pretty naturally over the course of the game. You can force it if you really need to

**[31:05]** get that unlimited combat, but otherwise these things are just going to play out as the game

**[31:10]** happens. Some general tips for playing Cho-Cho. If you're not playing with the high priest expansion

**[31:19]** you should really take advantage of your high priests. You're going to be able to use them to

**[31:23]** to have the Power to build Gates or use them to steal Gates cheaply after everybody else is out

**[31:29]** of Power. If you're playing with high priest expansion be careful about the timing of Hierophants

**[31:35]** because you really don't want to be giving away too much free Power to the other players,

**[31:40]** but it is also kind of dependent on what factions are in the game.

**[31:46]** If you can be on between one and three Gates every

**[31:49]** doom phase, you're doing great. Ritualing every turn and trying to earn the rest of your Spellbooks.

**[31:57]** I think Cho-Cho are super down to pay like seven or eight Power

**[32:00]** to ritual. Even if they're on one or two Gates it's usually worth doing.

**[32:06]** You could say this faction gets weaker as the game goes on and that's because rituals are

**[32:10]** going to be more expensive as the game goes on. At some point the Cho-Cho player might be spending

**[32:16]** their Power to ritual and they just don't have a lot else to do. That's okay. That's really all

**[32:21]** that they're here to do is collect their five to seven doom every turn from rituals, but keep in

**[32:26]** mind you might have to make a really hard choice at some point whether or not to ritual. I would

**[32:32]** only not ritual if it's going to be the difference between me having the Power to go out and claim

**[32:37]** several Gates. Maybe that's the only time to not do it. You're really going to want to be

**[32:44]** trying to talk the other players out of killing you. That's not going to work against the smart

**[32:49]** players. Savvy players at the table, they are going to come for you, so if you're playing Cho-Cho

**[32:56]** you just want to make it so that your opponents really need to commit in order to take your

**[33:01]** Gates from you. I think it's important as this faction to properly practice evenly distributing

**[33:07]** your Cultists across your Gates. Every Gate you have should have between one and three Cultists,

**[33:15]** maybe also proto, maybe also your great old one. Another thing to keep in mind,

**[33:21]** this faction's not good at moving. If possible, make it so that your Gated areas are adjacent

**[33:27]** to each other and that way you're going to be more easily able to move in and protect them.

**[33:32]** All right, general tips for thwarting Cho-Cho. Good players, they're going to tell you Cho-Cho

**[33:42]** can't be allowed to exist. That's true, it's just a villain faction. You need to keep your eye on

**[33:47]** them at all times. Constantly be thinking about how much doom they have right now, how much doom

**[33:51]** they'll have at the end of the next doom phase. They are going to ritual like 95% of the time.

**[33:56]** If you fight them early on, there's not that much they can do about a moderate amount of

**[34:01]** combat dice coming at them. Submerging Cthulhu can be pretty devastating to Cho-Cho. If Ugo's

**[34:09]** not rolling a lot of dice, unless they have an army of proto shogoths, they're really not that

**[34:14]** much of a big deal in combat. Like we said earlier in the unique faction ability section, just don't

**[34:23]** faction ability section. Just don't give them doom with sycophancy unless it's absolutely necessary

**[34:29]** or you're about to win and you think you can outrace them. Last thing, target those high

**[34:35]** priests. Move in, force them to pop them, spend Power to re-recruit them. If Cho-Cho's down to

**[34:41]** zero to one high priest at the end of the action phase, you've probably done a good job. That means

**[34:45]** that they won't be able to pop multiple high priests, go steal a Gate, or go build a Gate.

**[34:51]** You just don't want them to be doing that. You can avoid it.

**[34:57]** Okay, now I'm gonna break down and start getting into the tribes here, starting with the Sang

**[35:03]** tribe. If you've been playing with Cho-Cho since whenever it first came out, you've been playing

**[35:08]** with the Sang tribe this whole time. This is the most self-indulgent of the tribes. Sang really

**[35:15]** wants to be left alone to their own devices so they can just ritual every single turn on one

**[35:20]** to three Gates and win the game. Through their tablet of the gods Spellbook, which we'll talk

**[35:25]** about, they have the ability to earn even more Elder Signs on top of the one that they'll get

**[35:30]** for rituals with Ubo, and because of that they have one of the faster doom tempos in the entire

**[35:36]** game. Very dangerous tribe, probably controversial as well. I think if you see people hating on Cho-Cho

**[35:45]** online, they're probably talking about the Sang tribe specifically. So anyway, like I said, I don't

**[35:51]** know the timeline of events, but I think it was a good thing to come up with some alternatives to

**[35:56]** Sang tribe. Let's break down some of these Sang-specific Spellbooks. Starting with Idolatry,

**[36:04]** one cost action, select an area containing another faction's starting glyph, even if that

**[36:09]** faction is not in play. Move any or all of your units in adjacent areas into the selected area.

**[36:16]** This is the only movement ability across all of the tribes, but it's pretty nice, pretty nasty

**[36:24]** depending on where you are positioned. One area I'll shout out on Earth that I really like for

**[36:30]** this is the North Atlantic, because regardless of the player count, you're going to be adjacent to

**[36:37]** Arctic Ocean, North America, Europe, West Africa. You could be adjacent to multiple start areas,

**[36:45]** even if those factions are not in the game. Those are great areas to build your second Gate.

**[36:50]** You can bounce between your North Atlantic Gate and some of your other Gates and kind of save

**[36:55]** Power on moving that way. It can be difficult to dislodge a Sang player who is properly idolatry-ing

**[37:05]** between two locations and make their Gates difficult to pick off. Second Spellbook,

**[37:12]** Martyrdom. Post-battle, if your high priest is killed, all kills assigned to your units become

**[37:18]** pains instead. Very annoying. Good Sang players are always going to have a high priest in the

**[37:24]** battle area. When you want to go for the jugular and kill them, you're not going to be able to.

**[37:29]** You're going to need to have cooperation from the other players. Martyrdom is just going to

**[37:34]** really put a stop to anything aside from the most dedicated attacks from multiple players.

**[37:40]** They're not going to be able to ruin you unless you really get fought multiple times and multiple

**[37:45]** high priests are lost if you have martyrdom. Last Sang Spellbook is Tablet of the Gods,

**[37:51]** Doom Phase. When you perform a Ritual of Annihilation, you also receive one additional

**[37:56]** Elder Sign for each Gate at which you have any high priest. Then eliminate all of your high

**[38:01]** priests. This is not optional. Really spicy book. To max out Tablet of the Gods, you're going to

**[38:09]** need to have three Gates with a high priest at each. That's a lot of doom in one turn.

**[38:13]** The trade-off, you'll have to give up all of your high priest and that's a lot of Power to give up,

**[38:17]** but if you're planning to close out the game anyway, Tablet of the Gods is a great way to do

**[38:21]** that because you can get really explosive doom tempo here. Your opponents are going to need to

**[38:28]** keep this one in mind if you're playing as Sang and be trying to math out how much doom exactly

**[38:33]** can Sang get if they take advantage of Tablet of the Gods. Some tips for playing Sang tribe

**[38:40]** specifically. I've already been talking about Tablet of the Gods. That's really key. This tribe

**[38:45]** really does want to just lounge around and if you ever have a high priest to give up,

**[38:50]** to tablet to get an extra Elder Sign, I would do that. It really is that simple.

**[38:55]** It's going to make it really easy for you to earn your own three Elder Sign Spellbook.

**[39:01]** Martyrdom, I would only really use this one as needed to keep Uo alive. Because of tablets,

**[39:07]** you really do want to have your High Priest intact on the doom phase so that you can get

**[39:11]** those extra doom points for them. No super specific tips for thwarting the Sang Tribe,

**[39:19]** just don't let them exist, don't let them have multiple Gates. This is the worst foe among all

**[39:25]** the tribes in terms of doom tempo, so if you can help it, keep them on 0 to 1 Gates if at all

**[39:31]** possible. Moving on to the second tribe, the Leng Tribe. Plateau of Leng down there in the

**[39:41]** South Pole, Mountains of Madness. You may have read about Leng there. This is a different flavor

**[39:47]** of Cho-Cho. If you're playing with tribes, you're probably going to see this one a lot more often,

**[39:52]** much more interactive with the other players than the Sang Tribe. I think this one is extremely fun

**[39:58]** and has a very exciting Spellbook to close out the game with Fulmination.

**[40:04]** Let's just get right into the Spellbooks and talk about Fulmination first. Post-battle,

**[40:09]** if Ubo-Sothla is killed in a battle, you may remove from the game permanently and gain one

**[40:13]** Elder Sign for each unit killed on both sides in that battle. This Spellbook alone is the reason

**[40:19]** to play Leng Tribe. I think this one is hilarious. It's very helpful if players know about this one

**[40:26]** going in. You might have some salt the first time somebody uses this book and just gets like

**[40:31]** eight Elder Signs and wins the game out of nowhere. People might be upset about that, but

**[40:36]** once everybody knows about it, I love this book. It does a really funny thing to the game.

**[40:41]** It makes for very exciting conclusions. You might find savvy players actually

**[40:47]** running away from you once Ubo has grown enough to roll a bunch of dice.

**[40:53]** If you're playing Cho-Cho against savvy players, you're probably going to get beat down to 0-1

**[40:58]** Gates pretty often. You're not going to really have a lot of resources left in the game other

**[41:03]** than maybe a bunch of bodies and, you know, seven or eight Power to spend on movement.

**[41:10]** That is when you want to go for the Fulmination. If you can get like five or six kills across the

**[41:15]** battle, that's great. 1.67 doom for every Elder Sign. You can see how you can easily get 10

**[41:22]** doom here and close out the game. So if you're playing Leng Tribe, you really want to be angling

**[41:27]** to find that large battle and win once you have unlimited combat and Fulmination.

**[41:34]** 2.67 surprise. Two cost action, choose an enemy faction. That player selects and eliminates one

**[41:41]** of their acolytes and you replace it with a proto shogoth from your pool. Sort of a weird Spellbook.

**[41:48]** It's like a play on dreams and I think you should think about using this in a similar way to dream.

**[41:55]** So what I mean by that is this one is best used when there's a player that is spread thin on many

**[42:02]** Gates so they don't have many duplicate acolytes on their Gated areas, if that makes sense.

**[42:08]** So like a player on six Gates, if you surprise them, they will be losing a Gate. So most effective

**[42:15]** on players that don't have many acolytes on the map and don't have many redundant acolytes on

**[42:21]** their Gated areas. It can be really nice if you hit somebody with this and they lose control of

**[42:28]** the Gate and then your next action you're able to just recruit into that Gate and you already have

**[42:32]** a monster guarding the Gate. That can be pretty handy. The other thing you want to keep in mind

**[42:38]** with surprise is if somebody chooses to let you get a proto shogoth in their start area, that's

**[42:44]** going to work really well. Great segue into the next Spellbook for langtribe, the last Spellbook

**[42:50]** for lang, dark rituals. It's a zero cost action. Flip the Spellbook face down. All factions with

**[42:57]** your high priest in their start areas must pay you two doom or two Power, their choice. A faction

**[43:03]** with less than two Power or doom is immune. Flip this Spellbook face up again at the doom phase.

**[43:10]** So a weird Spellbook, kind of difficult to set up. If you start moving your high priest into

**[43:17]** people's start areas, it's going to be very obvious what you're doing, hence why I'm suggesting

**[43:22]** get some assistance with this by using surprise if you can catch people slipping and they choose

**[43:28]** to let you get a proto shogoth in their start area. That's all you need to recruit a high priest

**[43:33]** into the start area later. Basically all you want to do is make sure you don't move a high priest in

**[43:39]** where it can be captured. That is your big mistake. The other thing to keep in mind with this book,

**[43:44]** if somebody's out of Power you can't steal anything from them, so don't wait until someone's

**[43:50]** out of Power to move in, you won't be able to get anything. Recommendation is get a proto in there,

**[43:56]** that's going to let you more easily, more safely move your high priest into the start area,

**[44:01]** hopefully get some Power or doom from somebody. I'm thinking like 80% of the time players are

**[44:09]** going to pay you the Power. If they know anything about chocho, paying two doom to

**[44:13]** them is not a good idea. Hopefully you're using this one and getting some Power out of it.

**[44:20]** Some general playing lang advice. Fulmination is everything for this faction.

**[44:27]** All the general advice for chocho still applies, like do your rituals as often as possible, but

**[44:33]** once ubou is rolling like more than 10 dice, ideally ubou is rolling something ridiculous

**[44:38]** like 15 dice or something, once you're in that range between ubou and your proto shogoths,

**[44:45]** don't be afraid to like skip your ritual and just spend all of your Power moving as many units as

**[44:52]** possible into an area with many units and fighting. Doesn't matter if it's a suicide mission,

**[44:58]** because at this point you're at like maybe high teens doom, you're at like 17 doom, you're really

**[45:05]** angling to score like I'd say five or six Elder Signs at a minimum. Hopefully you can just roll

**[45:10]** a million billion kills and you just earn a ton of doom like 10 or 12 doom all at once and end the

**[45:16]** game. Try to set that up, try to like engineer those battles where you can roll a lot of kills

**[45:23]** and have a lot of kills rolled against you because it's kills on both sides. So find that death ball

**[45:28]** of Windwalker units or Cthulhu units, that's exactly where you want to be having those kind

**[45:33]** of battles. Make sure you time this out right because if you don't get to 30 doom and you do

**[45:39]** earn those Elder Signs, you're going to have to remove uboh from the game. You're going to be

**[45:43]** incredibly frail afterwards, so yikes if you draw a lot of ones and you don't quite get to 30,

**[45:48]** that's going to be feeling pretty awkward. Last thing on playing lang is around dark rituals.

**[45:55]** It is a very weird book. I've never seen somebody use this one super super effectively,

**[46:00]** so don't force it to happen. Either it's going to happen for you or it won't. You can be perfectly

**[46:06]** fine winning the game and not using this Spellbook once. This one is like reminds me a bit of groth

**[46:12]** with black goat. It can be really really great if you can get it to work, but you'll be just fine.

**[46:18]** You can play a game without using it a single time and you'll can still be like playing well

**[46:23]** or playing correctly. On thwarting lang, I think I've already mentioned this, but

**[46:29]** fulmination is a big deal. So if you're aware of the fulmination book, just a totally legit

**[46:35]** thing to do is run away from those battles or maybe not move all of your units out of the way,

**[46:41]** but move all your combat dice out of the way. If you have narlathotep in the area next door

**[46:47]** to chocho and you've got all of your books, you're rolling 12 dice. Get that unit out of there.

**[46:52]** That's like 12 less dice in the battle. What chocho does not want to have to do is fight with

**[46:58]** them rolling all the dice on their side and all you have is a night gaunt and a flying

**[47:03]** polyp and a bunch of acolytes. They don't want to see that. So if you can ever figure out a way

**[47:07]** to roll as few dice as possible into that battle that they're hoping to fulminate in, that's what

**[47:13]** you want to be doing. And now we're moving on to our last and most mysterious chocho tribe. This is

**[47:20]** the sarkoman tribe. From the top, you won't even use this tribe unless you're using neutral units.

**[47:27]** So it's going to be getting a lot less action than the other two tribes, but if your group

**[47:33]** does use neutrals frequently, I think this one's going to be a lot of fun to get onto the table.

**[47:39]** And so the key characteristic of sarkoman, all their Spellbooks, all their tribal Spellbooks

**[47:43]** enhance neutrals. If your group doesn't use them often, it might take some negotiating

**[47:49]** on which neutrals to include so sarkoman can use its Spellbooks to the fullest potential.

**[47:54]** But again, with the tribal rules, you don't need to tell people you're using sarkoman, so

**[47:59]** in a game with neutrals, make them guess if you're using sarkoman or not would be my advice.

**[48:05]** You'll need both independent great old ones and monsters to fully take advantage of your

**[48:10]** tribal books. You'll see that once we break down the books. Starting with the first book,

**[48:17]** Doomsday, once per game, if you have a controlled Gate, flip this card face down,

**[48:22]** then immediately take from the pool one independent great old one with a cost of

**[48:27]** exactly two or four and place it at the Gate and take its loyalty card. This one sounds kind

**[48:33]** of restrictive, but I've looked into it and four costs is actually by far the most common cost for

**[48:38]** independent great old ones. So if there's some in the game, chances are they cost four and you'll

**[48:44]** be able to use this book. If you want a list of which ones cost four, I'll just go through a bunch.

**[48:49]** Abhoth, Chognar, Mamma Hydra, Yig, Beaucroak, Daddy Dagon, Kitana, Thoa, Byatis, Xulcha,

**[48:57]** Eihord, Glacky, Golanak is the only independent great old one I know of that cost two. No zero

**[49:03]** cost great old ones, so sorry, Gobogag. If those names didn't mean anything to you,

**[49:08]** keep listening. We'll cover them in another episode. This book is nice. It's essentially,

**[49:14]** assuming there's a great old one you can take with it, is saving you four Power and an action

**[49:19]** as well. So think carefully about which independent great old ones you want to take.

**[49:25]** I'm not going to do a crazy analysis of which are best for this faction, but I'd say anything

**[49:31]** that cares about Elder Signs is probably good, like Chognar and Ubosothla seems like they would

**[49:36]** be great friends. Early morning editing Graham here. Even putting aside all the specifics about

**[49:44]** great old ones, it's fundamentally just a good thing to have more great old ones because it's

**[49:49]** going to make it easier for you to defend your Gates. Chocho is going to have a hard time maybe

**[49:55]** even staying on two Gates, but having a second great old one in the mix is going to make that

**[50:00]** much much easier to defend. So I would consider taking this as one of your first Spellbooks.

**[50:07]** I would take it as early as possible, maybe not so early that we jeopardize the

**[50:12]** doom phase one Ubosothla though. We do want to be doing that no matter what every single game.

**[50:17]** I'll throw it back to recording Graham to talk about the second Spellbook.

**[50:23]** Second Spellbook, Inerrant. When you perform a Ritual of Annihilation in the doom phase,

**[50:28]** gain one additional Elder Sign for each enemy controlled Gate at which you have any great old

**[50:34]** ones. This weird book is a little bit reminding me of the requires attention style ability from

**[50:44]** the cats. Of course Ubo is going to count for this if Ubo is at an enemy Gate, but ideally you've got

**[50:50]** a couple of independent great old ones as well and you can score some additional Elder Signs.

**[50:55]** Quick reminder for independent great old ones, normally when you have one and you do a ritual

**[51:01]** you're not earning any Elder Signs, but with Inerrant you actually will assuming they're at

**[51:06]** the enemy Gate. Maybe that's something else to take into consideration if you're going to have

**[51:12]** independent great old one. Maybe something that is like a bit more sturdy that can survive a

**[51:16]** battle. Maybe think like neutral Azathoth which can soak up a kill. That's a great one to just

**[51:22]** have hanging out at an enemy Gate at the start of the doom phase. Sounds like it's difficult to do,

**[51:29]** you know, like making sure you have great old ones right at the end of the action phase at the enemy

**[51:33]** Gates, but remember you do have your high priest so it's going to be very easy for you to do this

**[51:38]** actually get into position after all the other players have spent their Power,

**[51:41]** assuming you're not playing with the high priest expansion.

**[51:45]** Last book for Sarcomand is Otherworld Alliances. It's an ongoing ability.

**[51:50]** Your neutral monsters and terrors each have plus one combat. Not a lot to say here,

**[51:56]** just generically good with monsters and terrors, but I think specifically good with anything that

**[52:01]** has abilities around combat. Two monsters I would shout out would be star vampires. Really,

**[52:09]** really good. Would love to roll additional dice with star vampires because of the potential to

**[52:13]** drain Power or doom from somebody, and also the lang spiders which we've not covered.

**[52:19]** Lang spiders can basically convert pains into kills, so any additional combat results that

**[52:24]** you can roll with lang spiders is a great place to be. Tips on playing Sarcomand. I would say,

**[52:34]** you know, rip those neutral units from the pool as soon as possible. You're going to want at least

**[52:39]** two or three independent great old ones or monsters or terrors before you're really having

**[52:45]** a good time and, you know, taking advantage of all of your Spellbooks. Keep in mind the rules for

**[52:50]** purchasing neutrals as well. You're only going to be able to purchase one neutral monster or

**[52:56]** terror at a time during the doom phase. It doesn't really work that way with independent great old

**[53:00]** ones. If you're playing this tribe in action phase one, I would definitely be like going for that

**[53:07]** greedy opening to build a second Gate, summon a high priest, and then move into the Gated area.

**[53:14]** The reason is in the start of gather Power, you should have 11 Power if you're on two Gates.

**[53:21]** Hopefully that means that you're the first player, so you have the first crack at the pool of neutral

**[53:26]** units. It's also important that you have two Gates because if you plan on recruiting a neutral

**[53:32]** monster, you're going to need to pay to doom. Warding Sarcomand tribe. I think it's pretty

**[53:39]** easy to just generally make their tribal Spellbooks less effective. They only really

**[53:45]** work on certain neutrals, so if you can identify ones that would pair well, like those neutral

**[53:51]** monsters that like to have combat, try to buy those before Sarcomand has a chance to. Try to

**[53:57]** buy the independent great old ones that they want to have. They only really benefit when they can

**[54:03]** get a lot of them, so if you also start taking interest in them, you're going to make the

**[54:09]** Sarcomand tribe player kind of sad. Before the game, a lot of discussion to be had on

**[54:15]** how to pick neutrals, how many of them, which ones. I guess I would plug again like if you're

**[54:21]** able to do it randomly, maybe that's the way to go. One more neutral than the number of players,

**[54:29]** and maybe my suggested breakdown would be like in a four-player game, five neutrals available,

**[54:36]** three of them are great old ones, two of them are monsters and terrors. You can do that randomly,

**[54:40]** you can have the players try to pick, leave that up to you and your group. I still haven't figured

**[54:45]** out the best way to do this one. And I think we've come to the end of the Cho-Cho guide.

**[54:54]** That was a real journey. We've covered, I don't know, 1.5 factions depending on how you count it.

**[55:00]** I really like the tribes. I think that's like a great addition to the game. I would even be

**[55:04]** interested in seeing tribes for other factions or some conception like tribes for other factions.

**[55:10]** I think it's a really interesting idea to like repurpose a Spellbook and have it do something

**[55:14]** else. Gives the game even more replayability than it already has. Do I think the tribes did

**[55:24]** maybe what their intention was, which was to make Cho-Cho more interesting, more interactive?

**[55:29]** Largely yes. I like the head games at the beginning of the game where you don't need

**[55:34]** to tell people what tribe you do. I do think Sang and Lang are more similar than they might

**[55:40]** feel on the surface. Lang just gets that explosive doom in the same way. It just kind

**[55:45]** of happens all at once instead of just on the doom phase from the rituals that Sang wants to do

**[55:51]** with Tablet of the Gods. So maybe Lang and Sang are pretty similar still, but Sarcoment is really

**[55:58]** cool. I've only seen this one a couple of times. I'd like to see it on the table a bit more,

**[56:02]** but I think that's really cool to have a faction that really works with neutrals.

**[56:07]** Do I think the Cho-Cho are balanced? Maybe they're like five percent over tuned and they

**[56:14]** are a little bit strong, but again like I was saying in my threat assessment politics episode,

**[56:20]** as long as you're talking with the table and discussing who is the danger and discussing

**[56:25]** who's the leader and how much doom everybody can have, I do think that that will like self-balance

**[56:32]** the game. And in that sense I don't think Cho-Cho is overPowered. If everybody knows

**[56:38]** what Cho-Cho is capable of, I think that you can all kind of balance the game, come to an

**[56:44]** agreement on when to punch, when not to punch. You should really be punching this faction as

**[56:49]** often as possible. Hopefully you found this guide useful. Hopefully you understand your friends who

**[56:58]** play Cho-Cho a bit better, why they like it. If you hate Cho-Cho with a passion, hopefully you

**[57:04]** understand a bit better how to hurt the Cho-Cho. If you really have a problem with Cho-Cho,

**[57:11]** just play with Lang tribe specifically. I think you'll be fine with it then.

**[57:15]** Lang is just interactive enough. I think you'll find it's more like a yellow sign or an ancients

**[57:21]** and you'll be fine with the amount of doom that they're gaining and you'll have a lot of fun

**[57:26]** trying to avoid those battles with culmination. And yeah that's another episode of the book so
