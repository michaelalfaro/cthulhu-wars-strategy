## Transcript

**[00:00]** I remember that last night, when I threw a startled glance into the sky and saw the stars

**[00:06]** had been blotted out, I thought that the cloud which had been obscured by the sky looked

**[00:10]** curiously like the outline of a great man.

**[00:13]** And I remember, too, that where the top of the cloud must have been, or the head of the

**[00:17]** thing should have been, there were two gleaming stars, visible despite the shadow, two gleaming

**[00:23]** stars burning bright like eyes.

**[00:41]** Hello and welcome to another episode of Opening The Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:47]** My name's Graham and I'll be your host.

**[00:50]** Hope you're doing well.

**[00:52]** I'm doing much, much better than the last time I was recording.

**[00:56]** I'm COVID-free, and I am also recently back from PAX Unplugged, where I had an amazing

**[01:02]** time.

**[01:03]** I played all of my favorite games, played a big 34-person Blob That Ate Everything Else

**[01:09]** event with Arkham Horror the Card Game, a couple of games of Root, a few games of Commander,

**[01:16]** and happy to say I was lucky enough not only to play Cthulhu Wars at all at PAX, but we

**[01:20]** managed to put together a 9-player game on the big neoprene 9-to-11 player map.

**[01:26]** Never thought that would happen, but I'm very glad that it did.

**[01:30]** So very quickly before I get into the episode, I wanted to just talk a little bit about that.

**[01:35]** First, huge shoutout to everyone that participated in the game, in particular Ross and Leah,

**[01:40]** who ended up bringing most of Cthulhu Wars with them.

**[01:43]** It just wasn't feasible for me to travel the way I was traveling on a train, bring the

**[01:47]** entire game, but bringing it in chunks with different people worked out really, really

**[01:52]** nicely.

**[01:53]** So shoutout to Ross and Leah, as well as the other players in the game.

**[01:56]** We had Evan, Xander, Dylan, Cesar, Liv, and Joe to round it out.

**[02:02]** I think everybody had a great time, and somehow we actually clocked in at under three and

**[02:07]** a half hours, which I was very shocked by.

**[02:09]** I was fully expecting, we started at 6pm, was fully expecting to be walking out of there

**[02:14]** at 11.30 midnight and being tired and grumpy, but no, it was 9.30, it was a great game.

**[02:21]** This game had every faction present except for Cho-Cho and the Ancients.

**[02:27]** We did a high roll to see who would draft their faction first, so I ended up being able

**[02:32]** to play my love, Black Goat, and yeah, it was a pretty exciting game.

**[02:37]** There were several points in the game we thought it was going to be a runaway win for one faction

**[02:41]** or another.

**[02:42]** At one point, it seemed like the cats were going to win.

**[02:45]** The cats then got put into the ground, slowed down quite a bit.

**[02:49]** At one point, Sleeper had six Gates, that was also quite scary.

**[02:54]** I thought I was going to quietly coast to victory as Black Goat, but ended up being

**[02:59]** Xander, who was playing their first ever Cthulhu Wars game, and ended up taking it down as

**[03:04]** Wind Walker at 39 doom.

**[03:07]** I was trailing behind at 33, didn't have the best Elder Signs.

**[03:11]** We had Sleeper at 30 doom in third place.

**[03:15]** A lot of fun, thought I would maybe record an entire episode about that, but felt a little

**[03:20]** bit like not quite enough material.

**[03:22]** I have some pictures and a little bit of my thoughts during and after the game on the

**[03:27]** Cthulhu Wars Discord if you want to read about it there.

**[03:32]** Enough with the small talk though, what are we talking about today?

**[03:34]** We've got another faction guide, this time on a very cool faction, Wind Walker.

**[03:41]** I'm going to try my best to keep the ice puns at a minimum from here on out.

**[03:47]** If I make one, I promise you it was unintentional.

**[03:50]** If you are looking for the ice puns, go watch Batman and Robin, okay?

**[03:57]** So opening thoughts on this faction.

**[03:59]** It's another faction with two great old ones.

**[04:01]** You've got Ithaca and Rantagoth.

**[04:05]** This is kind of a mashup of two different authors.

**[04:10]** So Rantagoth is from the story, The Horror in the Museum, that H.P.

**[04:16]** Lovecraft wrote with Hazel Heald.

**[04:19]** And Ithaca is from an August Durlath story called The Thing That Walked on the Wind.

**[04:26]** Good idea combining these two things.

**[04:29]** Lovecraft and Durlath were in pretty close contact, so it kind of makes sense to combine

**[04:33]** them.

**[04:34]** They're both from the colder areas of the world, so it makes sense that they joined

**[04:39]** up to be alongside each other in one faction.

**[04:43]** This is a really great faction.

**[04:44]** I think it's one of the strongest factions in the game if I had to rank them.

**[04:48]** I would probably put Wind Walker as number one or two, absolutely in the top three when

**[04:53]** played correctly.

**[04:56]** This I find is a great faction for beginners.

**[04:59]** I often point new players toward this faction for some of their first games because playing

**[05:04]** it's pretty straightforward, but that's not to say that it's simple or easy.

**[05:09]** Make no mistake, this faction is also very, very scary and strong when piloted by an experienced

**[05:15]** player who knows what they're doing.

**[05:18]** This is another faction, too.

**[05:19]** One of the great strengths here is it's very flexible.

**[05:23]** It is another pillar of the fighty factions in Cthulhu Wars, I would say, alongside Great

**[05:28]** Cthulhu and Crawling Chaos, possibly among the best fighters in the entire game.

**[05:34]** But having said that, it's got the tools to also be played in a more defensive style,

**[05:40]** like a ritual-centric style, and either one of those can be very hard to stop.

**[05:45]** The great Wind Walker players can kind of blend and pivot between those two styles and

**[05:51]** make it really challenging for you, the opponents, to figure out what to do in order to stop

**[05:55]** them at any given point in time.

**[05:59]** One of the main mechanics of this faction is their unique ability we'll talk more about.

**[06:04]** It kind of allows them to stop doing stuff and store up their Power for another day.

**[06:11]** Think of them like a big grizzly bear that's deciding to hibernate for the winter and you

**[06:17]** really don't want to be nearby when they decide to finally wake up and do some stuff.

**[06:22]** This faction likes to take a turn off and kind of build up to a big turn where they

**[06:28]** go and do a bunch of stuff, probably devastate their opponents, and get a couple of Spellbooks

**[06:33]** on the way.

**[06:34]** I don't really have too much else to say on the opening thoughts, this is just another

**[06:40]** really classic faction, so if you were looking for this guide earlier, sorry you had to wait

**[06:44]** so long, but I did want to cover all the new stuff first and then kind of get around

**[06:49]** to these classic expansions to round out what I have left to cover in the podcast.

**[06:56]** All that being said, let's just get into it and we'll start with the setup for Windwalker.

**[07:02]** After everyone except Opener of the Way has set up, Windwalker sets up with 8 Power, 6

**[07:06]** acolytes, and a controlled Gate in one of the areas marked with the Windwalker glyph.

**[07:11]** So if you're looking on a map of Earth, you'll see those glyphs on the two poles, so the

**[07:16]** North Pole and the South Pole, makes sense, because that's where it's called.

**[07:19]** You're going to set up on one of these two poles, and you're going to need to migrate

**[07:23]** from one to the other and build a Gate there at some point during the game for one of your

**[07:26]** Spellbook requirements.

**[07:29]** Choosing which pole at the start to set up on is not a huge consideration, but one thing

**[07:34]** I'd be mindful of is if Great Cthulhu is in the game, you probably don't want to start

**[07:39]** in the Arctic Ocean, it being an ocean area.

**[07:42]** That's because Cthulhu has that Ocean Gates Spellbook requirement, and you will be inadvertently

**[07:47]** contributing to it by setting up there.

**[07:53]** On to the unique faction ability.

**[07:56]** This is Hibernate.

**[07:57]** It's a zero-cost action.

**[07:59]** Add plus one Power to your total for each enemy Great Old One in play, but not more

**[08:03]** than your starting Power.

**[08:04]** You can take no further actions during this action phase.

**[08:08]** At the start of the next gather Power phase, you do not lose your Power, but you instead

**[08:12]** add it to your total.

**[08:14]** This is a very silly and fun and Powerful ability.

**[08:19]** If you've been playing other factions, you might have had a case like every so often

**[08:23]** where you're like, ah, I don't really have anything to do.

**[08:27]** In that case, you can kind of just drop out of the game, and your Power drops to zero.

**[08:31]** Wind Walker doesn't have this problem.

**[08:33]** If they ever don't have anything to do, or they don't feel like doing anything else,

**[08:37]** they can just Hibernate, and then they save the Power they haven't spent, and if there

**[08:41]** are any other Great Old Ones on the map, they actually get a little bit of Power on top

**[08:46]** of all that.

**[08:48]** Do note the restriction.

**[08:49]** You can't gain more Power than you already have at the time that you Hibernate, so

**[08:53]** an example, say there's three great old ones on the map but you only have one Power, you won't be

**[08:58]** able to gain more than one Power from hibernating. So if you were in a really large game though and

**[09:04]** you had like maybe five Power and there's like six great old ones, if you hibernated you would

**[09:08]** get five Power and then you'd have like 10 extra Power to start with next turn.

**[09:15]** I'd say you can get by using hibernate like sparingly or even not at all, but I don't

**[09:22]** recommend it. You will find the more you play Windwalker it's extremely strong this ability

**[09:27]** if you can also manage to get a few Power out of it in the process. Imagine gaining three to

**[09:32]** five Power, that's like most of a ritual, especially because of one of Windwalker's

**[09:37]** Spellbooks we'll talk a little bit more about later. When you use hibernate and store up a

**[09:43]** lot of Power repeatedly you can get a lot of Power, I'm talking more Power than any other faction,

**[09:50]** easily getting into the 20 plus Power range. I've seen Windwalker get as high as 30 Power

**[09:56]** on primeval map. This faction can get to insane amounts of Power by repeatedly hibernating.

**[10:03]** I'll talk a lot more about that in the openings and like playing Windwalker.

**[10:08]** I don't have like a lot of prescriptive advice for this ability but generally if you don't have

**[10:13]** anything productive to do like steal a Gate or get into an important area, especially early on

**[10:18]** in the game when people don't have unlimited combat, I'd consider just hungering down and

**[10:22]** hibernating. It's pretty safe to do that. You do have two great old ones at the end of the day and

**[10:29]** maybe even 2.5 great old ones. You have this very annoying piece of ice, the ice age marker,

**[10:34]** that makes it a lot safer to drop out while other players are still doing things.

**[10:39]** Two great old ones plus ice age plus your other units, you can hold down like two Gates or maybe

**[10:45]** even three without too much trouble early on in the game. I'll talk a lot more about that in

**[10:50]** opening strategies. I think that's enough on hibernate then. We'll get into the Spellbook

**[10:56]** requirements for Windwalker. First one, you are the first player, as in like the player who has

**[11:04]** the most Power becomes the first player, and Windwalker can never be the first player to start

**[11:10]** a game of Cthulhu Wars for that reason. This Spellbook requirement sounds pretty easy when

**[11:16]** taking the Power you can save and gain from hibernation into account, and it really is.

**[11:21]** If you hibernate early, again more on this in the openings, you're gonna have a pretty easy time

**[11:26]** earning this Spellbook. I would just caution you if you want to wait on the Spellbook and try to

**[11:31]** get it later, just know that you might run the risk of people having a really good turn and you

**[11:37]** might never become the first player, and that is a really bad look. I've seen it happen and it feels

**[11:43]** very bad to know that you had a good opportunity to get this early and then you just never are

**[11:48]** able to get it again late, so plan accordingly. Let's do another requirement here. Another

**[11:55]** faction has six Spellbooks on their faction card. This one's out of your control when it

**[12:00]** exactly happens, but it is guaranteed to happen in a game of Cthulhu Wars. The only question is

**[12:06]** exactly when, so I would say don't even worry about this one because it's basically free, just

**[12:12]** not exactly sure when you'll get it. Next Spellbook requirement, a Gate exists in an area marked with

**[12:20]** the Windwalker glyph and in which you did not start. This is what I was talking about in the

**[12:26]** setup a little bit ago. You're gonna need to travel to the opposite pole and build a Gate most

**[12:32]** likely in order to earn this. It's actually not that far away, even in a higher player count game

**[12:38]** like a six player game, it's typically only three spaces away to get from the south pole to the north

**[12:43]** pole or vice versa. I would say this one is pretty similar to expanding into multiple areas

**[12:52]** with black goat in that you do not need to rush to get this. It's possible to go get it as early as

**[12:59]** the first action phase but I wouldn't recommend it more on that in the openings. Windwalker is

**[13:03]** really good with hibernation of like storing up Power for a big turn and that's one of the things

**[13:08]** I really like to do on that big turn is like get up to the north pole or the south pole and build

**[13:14]** that Gate. You can do that and still have plenty of Power left to run a couple of other errands

**[13:20]** like punching people in the face on your way over there. Most of the time you're gonna have to do

**[13:26]** this yourself if your opponents know what they're doing but maybe someone will be nice to you like

**[13:30]** opener might move a Gate there or I'm not sure what will happen but generally savvy players

**[13:36]** they're not going to build this Gate for you so you need to keep that in mind as you're playing

**[13:39]** as this faction. Talk about the next two maybe as a pair that's like awakening your great old ones

**[13:48]** Rantagoth and Ithaca. They both cost six Power to awaken so they're not super cheap but yeah

**[13:55]** remember hibernate you should have tons of Power as this faction most of the time making the

**[13:59]** awakening not that much of a thing. Just one quick note on Ithaca specifically we'll talk a little

**[14:06]** bit more about but when you awaken Ithaca you will end up like replacing the Gate in which you

**[14:11]** awakened so maybe don't do that at the end of the action phase because you don't really want

**[14:17]** to miss out on the Power and doom in that area if you don't need to. And the last small book for

**[14:24]** Windwalker is totally free take this spell book at any time gain one Elder Sign for each enemy

**[14:31]** player with six spell books on their faction card to a maximum of three Elder Signs. So this is

**[14:37]** another one that's guaranteed to happen at some point pretty much typically you're just going to

**[14:42]** get this after all other players have six books and you're going to get three free Elder Signs

**[14:49]** say that five times fast. That's really really nice I don't think this faction needs the help

**[14:54]** honestly and I wish it were three free doom but here we are it's Elder Signs. It's a big boost

**[15:02]** that's basically like five doom on average for free so that's a big deal that's a lot of doom.

**[15:10]** You can get this book even earlier and like forego one or more of those Elder Signs I'll talk more

**[15:15]** about that later I leave that up to you but yeah it's hard to pass up so much free doom do at your

**[15:20]** own risk. And those are the Spellbook requirements out of the way so I'll move on to the units for

**[15:28]** Windwalker starting with the acolytes. They are sculpted by title four good job don't really look

**[15:36]** too much like Cultists but they are kind of cool looking little guys in parkas they look like they

**[15:40]** have a gun where did they get that gun if they're worshipping Windwalker out in the cold I don't

**[15:45]** know that's okay. Spellbook that works with the Windwalker acolytes is cannibalism basically lets

**[15:53]** you place an acolyte or another monster wendigo I'll talk about in a second whenever you kill an

**[15:59]** enemy unit in a battle. Not too much to say other than like do throw your Windwalker acolytes under

**[16:06]** the bus and have them eat kills at any opportunity because once you have that cannibalism book

**[16:12]** they'll grow back pretty easily. I'll talk more about that in a little bit more detail.

**[16:18]** Next for Windwalker we have their first monster the wendigo you've got four of them they cost one

**[16:25]** and they have a combat of one. Sculpted by Gary Morley maybe a chewbacca kind of vibe going on

**[16:33]** just kind of a humanoid what you would expect a wendigo to be. Wendigos are something like a bit

**[16:39]** of a werewolf I think this is actually inspired by maybe the wendigo story by Aldrin and Blackwood

**[16:45]** not totally sure so don't quote me on that but yeah these guys look like they could

**[16:49]** punch you and eat you. Big mouth furry body some kind of lupine looking legs there.

**[16:56]** These ones are pretty nice you've got a really nice rate here this is like the

**[17:00]** undead Deep One rate of one Power to summon and one combat really like that. Cheap actions are

**[17:07]** good as I've said many times. Wendigos can also be placed with cannibalism I'll talk more about later

**[17:13]** and they also have another Spellbook howl that lets you kind of push units away before a battle happens.

**[17:19]** These guys can be pretty annoying and are good at holding down like tertiary Gates

**[17:23]** keeping them safe from lone units that would otherwise be able to claim them.

**[17:28]** Talk more about howl later but nice cheap monster good one to throw onto the bus after a big battle

**[17:35]** if you need to soak up some kills. They're a great body to have in the way at a minimum.

**[17:42]** And we'll move on to the next one.

**[17:47]** next unit for Wind Walker and that is the Naufkei. I was trying to find where these

**[17:54]** were from, what story they're from, I totally forgot and yeah, random Sandy

**[17:59]** Peterson video gave me the answer actually also from the Horror in the

**[18:03]** Museum story. It's just described as a myth thing of the Greenland ice that

**[18:08]** sometimes walks on two legs, sometimes four, and sometimes on six. The rulebook

**[18:15]** is crediting these as being sculpted by Stephen May, although in Sandy's video

**[18:20]** he said it was Richard Long, so whoever did this, great job. I like the way these

**[18:25]** look, just kind of big furry guys. You can see the fourth and sixth legs there in

**[18:33]** the bottom of them. They have some horns, kind of a skull-like face, and a weird

**[18:38]** looking mouth. They're very unsettling looking, but they definitely look like

**[18:42]** they're in the cold, like you'd find them on a hoth or something. You've got

**[18:47]** four Naufkeis in the pool. Their cost is equal to the number of Naufkeis in the

**[18:52]** pool, and their combat is three. The cost is pretty steep up front, so the first

**[18:59]** Naufkei you summon will cost you four Power, and the second will cost you three

**[19:03]** and so on as you get them all onto the map, but once these cost like two Power

**[19:07]** or one Power to summon, I really think these are amazing units. Two or one Power

**[19:12]** for a three combat monster is a great deal. They are adding a lot of dice to

**[19:19]** your Windwalker death ball, which we'll talk more about, and once you have most

**[19:24]** of them out on the map, you don't even really mind killing them all that much

**[19:27]** because of their Spellbook that works with them, Berserker Gang, basically lets

**[19:32]** you apply an extra kill when a Naufkei is killed in a battle. Very handy unit,

**[19:38]** kind of expensive. I think depending on the faction composition, you can sometimes

**[19:43]** get away with summoning few of these if any, but definitely if there's other

**[19:48]** fighty factions, I would be prioritizing getting the Naufkei out because they're

**[19:53]** gonna help you win these like straight-up confrontations against a

**[19:57]** Crawling Chaos or a Cthulhu or whoever you have to like beat down.

**[20:04]** And that's the last of the monsters out of the way, so I'll move on to the first

**[20:08]** of the two great old ones, starting with Rantigoth, sculpted by Sunny Bundgard.

**[20:14]** Hope I'm saying their name right. Very cool. I think this is one of my favorite

**[20:19]** sculpts in the game. It is very disgusting. One of my favorite ones to

**[20:22]** just show people like, do you see how detailed and nasty everything in this

**[20:27]** game is? Heard this one colloquially called Mr. Krabs. It's just a big nasty

**[20:35]** crab, but it's got a lot of tentacles coming down the face and tentacles in

**[20:41]** the undercarriage there. Very gross. Not pleasant to look at here. Sitting on a

**[20:46]** big throne of ice. Maybe in the museum. To awaken Rantigoth, all you're gonna need

**[20:54]** is to pay six Power and Rantigoth appears in any area containing the

**[21:00]** Windwalker glyph. And the ability on Ran is eternal. It's a post-battle. If Rantigoth

**[21:07]** receives a pain or a kill, you can pay one Power to cancel its effect on him.

**[21:12]** You can only receive one combat result per battle. First thing to note on the

**[21:20]** awakening, it does not require you to have a controlled Gate, nor does it need

**[21:25]** to be in the area that you started in. If you wanted to, you could wake up Ran on

**[21:30]** the other side of the world where you need to get to in order to build a Gate.

**[21:36]** Kind of a hot tech if you are playing with High Priest or Dunwich Horror and

**[21:41]** have some sort of access to additional Cultists. If you do, you could consider

**[21:46]** awakening Ran on the opposite pole and then recruiting maybe a High Priest

**[21:50]** and then you can build a Gate over there without having to walk there. That's kind

**[21:54]** of nice. Depending on where the other factions are located, you can also be

**[21:59]** kind of rude with this early on if you wanted to. Preying on Gates that don't

**[22:03]** have great old ones on them early on can be a thing that you can do. Normally I

**[22:09]** wouldn't advise just like showing up with your great old one at random Gates,

**[22:13]** but because of the eternal ability, it's pretty nice you can just ignore pains or

**[22:18]** kills as long as you have a Power to spare. And as long as the Gate that you're

**[22:22]** attacking doesn't have a great old one, just kind of keep capturing and doing

**[22:26]** your thing. It's not gonna be working when you have like zero Power though, so

**[22:32]** just be sure you have some Power in the bank if you're gonna do something

**[22:36]** somewhat risky with Ran. Lastly, I'd be very careful of Narlathotep from

**[22:43]** Crawling Chaos. Ran, Mr. Krabs, is one of Narlathotep's favorite great old ones to

**[22:48]** bully I find. Even if you ignore a pain or a kill with eternal, Crawling Chaos is

**[22:54]** still gonna get that Elder Signs or Power from the Harbinger ability, so be

**[23:00]** mindful of that. And that's enough on Ran, so I'll move on to the last great

**[23:07]** old one that's Ithaca, sculpted by a Neal McKenzie. This one's also really

**[23:13]** awesome looking, like one of the iconic sculpts in the game I would say. Just a

**[23:18]** big snake-like thing, but it's got arms and I just love the way that it is like

**[23:23]** twisting and twisting around, like from the bottom in the torso to the head and

**[23:28]** the tongue. It looks like it's twisting almost in like 360 degrees. I love the

**[23:33]** like nasty giant mouth with fangs and the tongue also continuing this like

**[23:39]** twisting pattern. Really pleasing to look at this one. It is very creepy and I think

**[23:45]** they did a really good job of describing exactly what Darlath was describing in

**[23:49]** the story. To awaken Ithaca, you will have needed to awaken Ran Tiggoth earlier. He

**[23:57]** doesn't need to be in play though. And number two, you're gonna need a Gate that

**[24:01]** exists in an area marked with the Wind Walker glyph. You don't need to control

**[24:05]** the Gate. And the third thing, you're gonna pay six Power and replace the Gate

**[24:10]** with Ithaca. So when you get Ithaca, the Gate is going away. You are deleting a

**[24:15]** Gate from the map. Combat of Ithaca is equal to half your opponent's doom

**[24:21]** rounded up. And the ability on Ithaca is Ferox. It's ongoing. While Ithaca is in

**[24:27]** play, your Cultists cannot be captured by enemy monsters or terrors. They are still

**[24:32]** vulnerable to enemy Great Old Ones. So on the combat, this Great Old One just

**[24:38]** becomes a real monster toward the end of the game. Once somebody has like 20 or

**[24:42]** more doom, Ithaca is rolling 10 or more dice on its own, which is a huge deal. I

**[24:48]** would call this Great Old One like the general of your army. It's the leader of

**[24:52]** your big death ball. It has a nice ability Arctic Wind Spellbook that we'll

**[24:57]** talk a bit about later. It allows you to kind of travel with Ithaca and bring a

**[25:02]** big entourage of units alongside it for only one Power. You really really don't

**[25:08]** want Ithaca to ever get killed if you can help it, and that's because it

**[25:11]** requires a Gate in one of those Wind Walker areas in order to awaken. But

**[25:16]** having said that, you don't need to control the Gate, so if somebody else has

**[25:19]** a Gate for whatever reason, you will delete their Gate and replace it with

**[25:23]** Ithaca if you were to awaken it later. Last comment is on Ferox. It's a really

**[25:30]** amazing ability. So basically your Cultists become immune to being captured

**[25:35]** by monsters, and the only way they can be captured is by other Great Old Ones.

**[25:39]** That's very handy. Makes it so that your Gates just become even more sticky and

**[25:45]** annoying for your opponents to deal with. They're gonna need to bring their

**[25:48]** Great Old Ones in to do it, or they're gonna need to like battle you away, and

**[25:52]** that's also gonna be a problem for them because you're gonna have probably a

**[25:56]** Wendigo and you might also have Howl. Just making it so that coming in and

**[26:00]** spending like two Power is probably not enough to steal a Gate from Wind Walker,

**[26:04]** and that's a very very valuable thing to have in any game.

**[26:10]** Okay, that's all the units done, so we'll move on to Spellbooks. I'll start with

**[26:17]** Arctic Wind since I had just mentioned it talking about Ithaca. It's an ongoing

**[26:22]** ability. When Ithaca uses the move action, any or all of your units in the same

**[26:27]** area can move with them for no additional cost. This is the Wind Walker

**[26:33]** movement ability. It is among the strongest in the game, I would say. Don't

**[26:38]** ever let Ithaca walk alone because it's easily killed.

**[26:41]** killed. Good news is that Ithaca can always drag along all of your other units in the

**[26:46]** area with it, so hopefully that never happens. You have the potential to form one of the

**[26:53]** scariest death balls in the game, and move it around for only one Power at a time is

**[26:58]** very very very handy. I've mentioned several times this faction likes to engage in like

**[27:04]** one big turn, like one big action phase where they do a bunch of stuff. Arctic Wind is key

**[27:09]** here. You will eventually maybe move out with your death ball and just march across the

**[27:16]** map, destroying Gates, taking Cultists, getting to that other pole maybe to build a Gate,

**[27:22]** and just crushing your enemies. Keeping your units consolidated is key here. Not too much

**[27:30]** else to say, it's pretty straightforward and very very good, so do take Arctic Wind whenever

**[27:36]** you awaken Ithaca as your Spellbook for sure. Let's move on to another Spellbook. Cannibalism,

**[27:46]** it's a post-battle. After all battle results have been applied, if one or more enemy units

**[27:51]** were killed, you may place a Wendigo or Acolyte from your pool into the battle area. You may

**[27:57]** do this even if you are not involved in the battle. Another extremely strong Spellbook,

**[28:03]** Amazing Ability if you are the one fighting. Like I said earlier, I highly recommend throwing

**[28:09]** your Acolytes and Wendigo under the bus if you're in a big confrontation. That's because

**[28:14]** assuming you kill something, and you probably will with this faction, you'll get to just

**[28:18]** immediately replace the Acolyte that you just killed or the Wendigo that you just killed.

**[28:23]** Best feeling is like after a big fight at a Gate that you're trying to claim,

**[28:28]** you roll some kills and you kill a couple of your own Acolytes in the battle, then cannibalism

**[28:34]** happens and you immediately get to place a Windwalker Acolyte into the area right away

**[28:38]** and take control of that Gate. That feels great, so if you can set that up, do so.

**[28:43]** Last thing on this book, you can do this even if you are not in the battle. I will do this

**[28:51]** from time to time, don't recommend doing it a lot of the time. Again, like consolidating

**[28:56]** your units into that big death ball is most of the time what you want to do, but occasionally

**[29:01]** you might want to place a Wendigo at some random Gate on the other side of the map.

**[29:06]** That Wendigo might be able to do some battling of its own or some capturing of its own. I

**[29:11]** leave that up to you. Maybe placing Acolytes can also be useful once you have Ferox, but

**[29:16]** I typically don't do this that much myself.

**[29:22]** Last Spellbook I should talk about, since we've already mentioned it several times,

**[29:25]** is Howl. It's a pre-battle. Before the battle, if any Wendigos are present, you may force

**[29:30]** an enemy to retreat one unit of their choice out of the area to an adjacent area. This

**[29:36]** is not a pain. The unit may be moved to an area containing your units.

**[29:42]** As I said, this is a nice one because it's going to force more of a commitment from anyone

**[29:47]** who wants to take your Gates by forcing them to bring multiple units. What I mean by that

**[29:52]** is like, suppose you have an Acolyte and a Wendigo sitting at a Gate. Cthulhu decides

**[29:58]** they want the Gate, they bring in the Starspawn, and they declare a battle. Well, they just

**[30:03]** wasted their Power because you can just Howl and they'll have to leave with the Starspawn,

**[30:08]** and no dice end up getting rolled, and they will have just wasted one Power moving in

**[30:12]** one Power battling. So, it forces your opponents to spend extra Power on what might be futile

**[30:18]** things to do, and that's exactly what you want to be doing as this faction. Already

**[30:22]** have this really nice ability of potentially getting more Power than any other faction

**[30:27]** at every point in the game, and anything that you can do to make your opponents spend their

**[30:32]** Power on things that are not very consequential is worth doing.

**[30:38]** And the other thing I would caution you on with Howl is just don't knee-jerk use this

**[30:43]** in every battle. You may want to not Howl things out. So, to give you an example, let's

**[30:49]** say you've got your Windwalker Deathball assembled and you roll up on Sleeper, and they don't

**[30:53]** have a lot of units and you're fully planning to kill the Toad, kill Sothogua, don't use

**[30:58]** Howl because Sothogua could just take advantage of that ability and move the Toad out of the

**[31:04]** area, and that's the unit that you want to kill. So, don't give your opponents an opportunity

**[31:09]** to move the valuable unit out of the battle that you're trying to actually kill.

**[31:17]** Next Spellbook we've got Berserker Gang. It's a post-battle ability. For each Nafke assigned

**[31:23]** a kill in battle, the enemy must eliminate one monster or Cultist. Could say, if you

**[31:31]** have 0-2 Nafkes, this is maybe your least useful Spellbook because the Nafkes are so

**[31:36]** expensive at that point. But, as soon as you can get up to 3 or 4 Nafkes in play, I think

**[31:42]** this one is extremely nice. You're already going to be able to get a lot of kills with

**[31:47]** your Deathball assembled. Like, if you have the full complement of Nafke, that's 12 dice

**[31:54]** plus 3 from Wran, plus maybe, let's say someone has 20 Doom, 10 from Ithaca, that's already

**[32:01]** like 25 dice, not counting any Wendigos that you might have. I already have a ton of potential

**[32:07]** to roll kills with just those dice, and then imagine you also kill several Nafke after

**[32:13]** the battle, that's even more kills on top of that. You can definitely get to a point

**[32:17]** where there's like no survivors. Once there's 3-4 Nafkes, I think Berserker Gang is actively

**[32:22]** good. You're basically paying 1 Power to get a unit, a Nafke in this case, 3 more dice,

**[32:28]** and then like an extra kill in every battle that you kill a Nafke. I like this one. I

**[32:34]** don't see it used maybe as often as it could be, but also, like I said, dependent on the

**[32:39]** faction composition a little bit, investing in those Nafkes in the first place.

**[32:46]** Next Spellbook for Windwalker is Ice Age. It's a 1-cost action. Place or move your Ice

**[32:52]** Age token into any area. When an enemy faction takes any action ending in the Ice Age area,

**[32:58]** they must pay 1 additional Power. So we got a nice Ice Age token sculpted by Ian Brumby.

**[33:08]** Jagged looking ice. I'm glad that they made this into like a 3D token as opposed to just

**[33:12]** a 2D piece of cardboard because it looks much cooler that way.

**[33:17]** So this is an extremely fun, extremely mean book. There's also a pretty lengthy frequently

**[33:24]** asked questions to go along with this. I'm not going to go over that frequently asked

**[33:28]** questions right now, but just know most things will cost more. Certain things that don't end

**[33:33]** in the area are not taxed. So think Submerge, for example. You're not actually ending in the

**[33:39]** area if you Submerge in the area with Ice Age. You're not on the map anymore, so you're not

**[33:43]** paying the additional Power. But re-emerging into an Ice Age area, that would cost you an

**[33:48]** additional Power, as one example. The Spellbook is extremely good. I would get it pretty early on

**[33:55]** if I were you. I would say this token is so strong, I would count it as even like 0.5 of

**[34:01]** a Great Old One. You could consider Windwalker to have 2.5 Great Old Ones. That's how strong

**[34:05]** I think Ice Age is. One thing I really like to do is have maybe Ithaca holding down a Gate,

**[34:12]** Wran holding down a Gate, and then you can have a third Gate maybe with Ice Age and a couple of

**[34:17]** redundant acolytes. It's actually very annoying to have to steal that Gate because let's just say

**[34:23]** it's 2 acolytes, no monsters, and Ice Age. Just moving in there, that's going to cost 2 Power.

**[34:28]** If you want to capture, you're going to have to capture twice. If you're going to battle,

**[34:33]** you've already spent 4 Power just to get that one Gate. That's a lot. Most people are going

**[34:38]** to be pretty turned off by that, and that's exactly what you want as Windwalker. When you're

**[34:44]** going to decide to drop out of the game and hibernate, you really want your Gates to just be

**[34:48]** as undesirable as possible, and between your 2 Great Old Ones and the Ice Age token, you've got

**[34:54]** all the tools to make people just kind of ignore you, and that's exactly the plan.

**[34:58]** Yes, you can use this on your Gates to protect yourself, but you can also use this to just be

**[35:03]** mean to other people. One thing I see frequently is putting this in an area where someone's going

**[35:10]** to awaken their Great Old One, make it more expensive. If you know something's going to go

**[35:14]** down in some area, you can just kind of make it more annoying for everybody involved by

**[35:18]** putting the Ice Age there. Good bit of diplomacy for this Spellbook, unexpectedly. If you can talk

**[35:26]** to people and be like, hey, don't mess with me, I'll Ice Age one of your Gates and help your

**[35:31]** Gates be protected from other players, you can go ahead and do that.

**[35:35]** with that angle too. A lot of possibilities and flexibility with how to use this one.

**[35:41]** And yeah this is another Spellbook I think is probably one of the best in the game I would say.

**[35:48]** And the last Spellbook for Wind Walker we've got Herald of the Outer Gods.

**[35:52]** Not herald like the name but a herald like I'm heralding the coming of something else.

**[35:58]** It's an ongoing ability. Pay five Power for Wind Walker's Ritual of Annihilation

**[36:03]** regardless of the number indicated on the ritual track. This is a handy Spellbook. In the opening

**[36:10]** section of the guide I mentioned Wind Walker can sometimes be like a ritual faction in a pinch and

**[36:15]** this is the main reason why. It doesn't matter how expensive the ritual gets if Wind Walker's

**[36:20]** always paying five. That's great. You have two great old ones so on just two Gates and two great

**[36:26]** old ones with a five cost ritual every turn that's six doom minimum. That's an amazing deal.

**[36:32]** And then also consider that you have hibernation so you probably also have some extra Power laying

**[36:38]** around making rituals like basically almost free for this faction and that is extremely strong.

**[36:45]** This is the main win condition of this faction I would say like Wind Walker can have these big

**[36:50]** turns where they get up to like three or four or five Gates and yeah you're probably winning the

**[36:54]** game at that point but even just two Gates ritualing every turn every opportunity that's

**[37:00]** going to close the game out very quickly. And I think that's all that I have to say on Spellbooks

**[37:07]** so I'll move on to opening strategies for Wind Walker. There's a lot going on here like a lot

**[37:14]** of play if I'm being honest but I'll try to go over some of like the more common ones that I see.

**[37:20]** First one to mention kind of like a nomadic Wind Walker. If you're impatient and you want

**[37:26]** to get that like opposite pole Spellbook requirement out of the way early on you can

**[37:30]** really get there in the first action phase if you want to. It's only three spaces away

**[37:35]** so you should have enough Power to like move an acolyte over there build a Gate and then still

**[37:40]** a couple Power left over to summon a wendigo at each of your Gates for protection. This is

**[37:45]** definitely a thing that you can do but like I said I ultimately don't think it's very necessary to do

**[37:51]** this and it's also prone to failure from savvy players who will know what you're up to. All they

**[37:58]** need to do really is plop a monster on the other pole and this whole plan kind of falls apart.

**[38:05]** Maybe you can build a Gate like on the way over there instead, maybe making it a little easier

**[38:09]** for yourself but I don't highly recommend this opening because it's so prone to being disrupted.

**[38:16]** But maybe you're really good at table talk as well and you can just talk people into

**[38:19]** letting you do that. That's definitely a thing. Three Gate opening not really a thing for Windwalker.

**[38:26]** Savvy players will never let you get away with that so I'd say don't even try that most of the

**[38:30]** time. You got better things to do than go for three Gates on action phase one.

**[38:37]** But like the boring two Gate opening quote-unquote boring. You can move and build a Gate and then

**[38:43]** you know summon a couple of wendigo and hibernate or maybe summon enough Gate start reducing the

**[38:48]** cost of those early on. It's not flashy but you'll still have the two Gates and the 10 Power going

**[38:53]** into the second action phase so cool. Kind of a middling opening. I don't super recommend this one

**[39:00]** but it is a thing that you can do. New player probably will do this and there's absolutely

**[39:04]** nothing wrong with it. You'll be kind of on pace with the other players if you do something like this.

**[39:10]** The main opening I want to talk about, the one I do recommend highly is just like silly hibernate

**[39:15]** shenanigans. So you just summon a wendigo and then hibernate when you're at seven Power.

**[39:22]** No seriously, do try to do this. It's actually very very good. Newer player would never think

**[39:29]** to do this because they're too preoccupied with like keeping their stuff safe but if you understand

**[39:34]** like what people are capable of and what people are planning to do in the first action phase

**[39:39]** you'll know this is actually extremely safe. Nobody's going to really want to spend their

**[39:43]** whole turn marching over to your home Gate just to try to mess with you. They have better things

**[39:48]** to do themselves. They also have their own priorities like waking up their great old ones

**[39:52]** next turn or getting a Spellbook requirement met. Very very unlikely somebody is going to

**[39:58]** try to mess with you if you do something like this. Assuming there's no other great old ones

**[40:03]** in play you could hibernate at seven Power after summoning a wendigo or even like summon a nafke

**[40:09]** and hibernate at four Power. You'll be starting at 15 Power in the next action phase if you went

**[40:15]** the wendigo route. That's going to guarantee you're the first player and you'll get that

**[40:19]** Spellbook requirement met even if somebody else for some reason decided to go for two additional

**[40:24]** Gates in action phase one. You'll still have more Power than them because that's how crazy

**[40:29]** hibernate is. In action phase two you could just hibernate again right away and I do seriously

**[40:36]** mean that and maybe even recommend it. You'll bank 15 Power or more depending on if someone

**[40:43]** woke up some great old one before your turn and you'll start action phase three on probably

**[40:49]** over 20 Power, probably 22-23 Power depending on what the turn order was. Again, a newer player

**[40:56]** might not think this is a good idea but just remember action phase two is pretty typical for

**[41:01]** people to take the entire turn off to awaken their great old ones so there's really not a

**[41:06]** lot people can do to stop you. If you really are worried about somebody messing with you,

**[41:12]** you will have earned your first player Spellbook more than likely and just take ice age and put

**[41:16]** the ice age token in your starting area. Nobody is going to come over there when you have six

**[41:21]** acolytes and ice age. It's just like a waste of their time to even bother you there.

**[41:26]** Okay so then on action phase three we have over 20 Power. What are we going to do?

**[41:31]** From here I usually get ran to goth and maybe start building my army. With this play style I

**[41:38]** typically will alternate between like awakening, summoning, and then hibernating. You'll still be

**[41:44]** like building up a reserve of Power and this is kind of like this concept of like building up to

**[41:48]** the big turn. You're getting your great old ones every other turn and then you know accumulating

**[41:55]** maybe a monster here or there and your goal is at some point you'll have both your great old ones,

**[42:01]** no great in your starting area, and probably like I don't know over 10 Power maybe like 12 or 15

**[42:07]** Power depending on how greedy you've been with hibernate. You should have plenty of Power to like

**[42:12]** eventually walk out of your start area, maybe claim a Gate, and start making your way up to

**[42:16]** the other side of the map where you need to build a Gate on the other Windwalker glyph.

**[42:22]** The main risk with this hibernate strategy is your doom tempo is going to be really slow. You're

**[42:27]** going to be getting like one doom a turn for the first few action phases. That's not a huge deal,

**[42:32]** but once the action phase three rolls around people are going to be starting to get up to like

**[42:36]** two and three and four Gates so if you keep hibernating into the fourth action phase, which

**[42:41]** I absolutely have done, you run the risk of never being able to catch up to the other players in

**[42:47]** terms of doom. Even once you get that peril of the outer gods, two Gates, five Power ritual,

**[42:54]** you might have a hard time catching up so just be careful about that.

**[42:58]** This one comes with experience, knowing what to do, exactly when to do it.

**[43:04]** Last opening I will mention I don't recommend but is definitely a thing you can do.

**[43:09]** Your last Spellbook requirement where you have like take this at any time and get the free elder

**[43:14]** signs if people have their six books. You could take this immediately if you want to. You won't

**[43:19]** get any Elder Signs for doing so but you can take any of your Spellbooks early on.

**[43:24]** One ice age is quote-unquote fun to take this early. You can just grief people and make somebody's

**[43:31]** life hell with this. Just totally disrupting the planned build order that somebody has can be

**[43:37]** kind of nice. If you know somebody that just never deviates from their opening strategy,

**[43:43]** you can like force them to do it with ice age if you really want to but definitely you're not

**[43:48]** doing yourself any favors above board. People are not going to be happy if you do this. I wouldn't

**[43:54]** even bother doing that ice age bit unless your faction knowledge is kind of like expert level.

**[43:59]** You don't really want to like put this token in a random area where it's not going to be doing

**[44:03]** anything and yeah just know you're like foregoing potentially six free doom on average. Don't

**[44:09]** recommend just taking that Spellbook for free but it is a thing that you can do.

**[44:15]** The other one I've been experimenting with lately is taking howl really early on and

**[44:20]** then kind of like harassing people's Gates with the wendigos which are extremely cheap.

**[44:24]** If they only have a single monster there you're either howling out the monster or the acolyte.

**[44:29]** controlling the Gate. That's potentially a thing, but if you're feeling frisky, if you're

**[44:34]** feeling experimental, go for this. Otherwise you can just ignore this last

**[44:38]** one that I just mentioned. I think that's it for opening strategies, so I'll move

**[44:44]** on to playing Wind Walker. I don't have a ton of stuff to say here, honestly. I

**[44:50]** really do think it's all about the hibernation. Always be hibernating, A-B-H,

**[44:55]** in order to build up to a big turn. Your goal should be having some turn where

**[45:01]** you have pretty sizable army with both your great old ones moving out. See if

**[45:06]** you can trace a path from whatever pole you're on over to the other pole,

**[45:10]** hopefully crossing through some under defended Gates on the way. If you do that,

**[45:15]** you can potentially have a turn where you end on like three or four Gates.

**[45:20]** You'll have most of your Spellbooks met, maybe except for that free one, and you

**[45:25]** should be able to like ritual on a couple of Gates and get a couple of

**[45:29]** Elder Signs going, and you're pretty much done after that. The main task that you

**[45:34]** need to do as this faction, which I've mentioned numerous times, is getting to

**[45:39]** that other side and building that Gate. You don't need to rush, you do need to do

**[45:43]** it at some point. So you can either do it all in one big turn, or maybe you can

**[45:48]** kind of like stagger your way and slowly migrate over there over the course of a

**[45:53]** couple of action phases. That's another approach to take. Let's talk about the

**[45:58]** death ball a little bit. You have the potential for a huge death ball. Think

**[46:02]** about the nafkes and investing in them. When you're doing that, think about the

**[46:07]** factions of the table. If the composition is like less fighty, so let me give you

**[46:11]** an example, Cho-Cho, Yellow Sign, and Demon Sultan or something. In that

**[46:17]** composition, nafke is much less important. I would not prioritize them, nor would I

**[46:23]** prioritize Berserker Gang as a Spellbook. You can probably get away with having a

**[46:27]** few to zero of them. However, if there's a more fightier composition, like Great

**[46:34]** Cthulhu, Crawling Chaos, maybe Sleeper Ancients or something, definitely get

**[46:39]** those nafke because they're gonna help you beat down the other fighty factions.

**[46:43]** And in that case, the dice and the Berserker Gang is gonna come in very

**[46:47]** handy to snipe those Great Old Ones, which are like gonna be the main things

**[46:51]** that cause you trouble as this faction.

**[46:55]** A free Spellbook with the Elder Signs, I will typically wait on this. I like that

**[47:00]** one to be the last book I take usually, because you can just take it and then

**[47:05]** suddenly get Unlimited Combat and still have the ability to take an action. It's

**[47:09]** not an action to take that book. Know that you can just take it literally at

**[47:13]** any time and hopefully catch your opponents off guard with this. It's

**[47:17]** pretty typical for Wind Walker to have like four or five Spellbooks for a while,

**[47:21]** and then as soon as that third player gets their sixth book, you can take this

**[47:25]** and then all of a sudden you're extremely scary with Unlimited Combat

**[47:28]** and a lot of dice going on. I mentioned this a few different times, but once you

**[47:35]** have gotten across the map and you've got all of your Spellbooks met, from there

**[47:39]** your win condition is really just like hold down two Gates and then ritual

**[47:43]** every turn. If you do that, you're getting a minimum of six doom, and that's gonna

**[47:49]** be a lot. Most factions are gonna have a hard time keeping up, aside from maybe

**[47:53]** like Cho's or Ancients or some of these other like ritual-based factions, Demon

**[47:58]** Sultan. Other factions that are like more linearly scoring doom like Cthulhu

**[48:04]** or Crawling Chaos, they're gonna have a really rough time keeping up with six

**[48:08]** doom a turn. Watch out for Madness, obviously. Everyone needs to watch out

**[48:13]** for it always. Try to keep your death ball consolidated at all times. Do not

**[48:19]** ever leave Ithaca isolated. That is the quickest way to losing a game as this

**[48:23]** faction is Ithaca being killed, there's no Gates on either pole, that is a really

**[48:29]** bad news and you don't want to see that happen.

**[48:32]** Last thing, just maybe more hibernate advice. Once you get into this late-game

**[48:37]** situation, definitely don't be hibernating first thing, but if you don't

**[48:42]** have anything consequential to do with your last like one or two or three Power,

**[48:45]** that's a great time to hibernate. You will have paid for an entire ritual most

**[48:50]** likely if you hibernate at that point, so if it's like a kind of low resource

**[48:54]** game, Windwalker is gonna really thrive in those games because hibernate is

**[48:57]** just gonna give you a lot of virtual Power the other players don't have

**[49:01]** access to. Hopefully when you're building up to like one of those bigger turns,

**[49:07]** you're just able to slowly spend your Power taking those one-cost actions,

**[49:11]** moving, recruiting, summoning Wendigo. Just take these cheap actions when you have

**[49:17]** the Power advantage. When you've like 15 Power and everyone else has 10, just

**[49:22]** spend your Power slowly. People are gonna run out and then you're gonna be easily

**[49:25]** able to claim one or two Gates and then the game is over at that point. If you're

**[49:30]** ever able to end on like three Gates a couple of times, the game's just done

**[49:35]** because you're gonna ritual and nobody's gonna be able to catch you in doom. Just

**[49:39]** remember like you're getting that six free doom, five or six free doom from

**[49:43]** those three free Elder Signs on average. I think that's all I had to say on

**[49:49]** playing Windwalker, so let's move on to thwarting Windwalker. Honestly, this is

**[49:56]** one of the hardest factions to fight against. This is one of the reasons I

**[49:59]** think it's one of the best factions in the game. When the Windwalker player

**[50:02]** knows what they're doing, it is just tough to beat them. Honestly, it is a bit

**[50:06]** of a group project, so be talking with the other players. You're probably not

**[50:10]** gonna be able to like beat down Windwalker straight up on your own, so

**[50:14]** rule number one, talk to the other players. Describe what's going on with

**[50:18]** Windwalker. Make sure everybody knows what they're capable of and what you all

**[50:22]** can do about it. Rule number two, if possible, just don't ever let Windwalker

**[50:28]** have more than two Gates. Even two Gates is probably one too many. As I said,

**[50:33]** they're getting six doom a turn on two Gates and that's far too much doom every

**[50:38]** turn. Even cats or Cho-Cho or Demon Sultan might have a hard time keeping up

**[50:43]** there. In rule three, if you ever have the chance to snipe Ithaca, definitely do

**[50:49]** that. That is the main driver of the death ball and if you are managed to

**[50:54]** kill Ithaca, they're gonna need to spend time awakening again and if they do,

**[50:59]** Ithaca is likely gonna be isolated again and if that happens, that's when you need

**[51:04]** your Cthulhu player or your Crawling Chaos player or whoever is able to fight.

**[51:08]** Swoop in there and kill it again, even if you end up losing something valuable

**[51:13]** yourself in the process. You're just gonna be slowing down Windwalker so much

**[51:17]** by doing that. That's a great thing. Ran is a different story, much harder to kill,

**[51:23]** but one thing that you can do if you have a big combat advantage, if

**[51:27]** Windwalker is already hibernating, go pick on the Gate with Ran and hopefully

**[51:32]** there's not a lot of other dice there. They can spend their Power while they're

**[51:37]** hibernating to use the Immortal ability, but know that you're like taxing them of

**[51:42]** Power that they won't be able to use on the following turn. So that can be

**[51:46]** another strategy, though it's not as effective as just killing Ithaca in the

**[51:50]** first place.

**[51:54]** And yeah, I think that's what I have for this Windwalker faction guide. Hopefully

**[52:00]** you found it useful. This is a really cool faction. It wasn't one of my favorites

**[52:04]** when I started playing, but I've come around, I see the light, and I see how

**[52:08]** strong this one is, and I also like all the shenanigans this faction can go for.

**[52:13]** So there's all kind of silly stuff you can get up to, and I encourage you

**[52:17]** experiment a little bit, see what you can do, especially with the hibernating, and

**[52:22]** see how much Power you can get up to with hibernate. I've lost plenty of games

**[52:26]** hibernating up until like action phase 4, and I just have a million Power. It's

**[52:31]** hilarious, it's entertaining, if nothing else. So give that a go, and let me know

**[52:36]** if you have any great Windwalker stories. Feel free to tell me about them. That's

**[52:42]** another episode in the book, so thanks for listening. Please rate, review, and
