## Transcript

**[00:00]** Have you ever heard of Bubastis? he asked. Bubastis? I was a little puzzled.

**[00:07]** Why, yes. Old Egyptian city, wasn't it? And isn't there a god, Bubastis, Bast, or

**[00:15]** Pasht, as they call it? Yes. Again, that puzzling smile. Bubastis, or Bast, was the

**[00:22]** cat goddess of Egypt during the days of the Pharaohs. According to the proper

**[00:27]** myth cycle, Bubastis was the daughter of Isis. The temples of the goddess were

**[00:31]** located separately in the cities of Bubastis and Elephantine. What are you

**[00:37]** getting at? I was frankly bewildered. He told me this was such an air of grave

**[00:42]** importance and his recurring smile was baffling. What do you mean? I mean that

**[00:47]** we're now entering the new temple of Bubastis, he said. Don't gape at me. If

**[00:52]** you've read Prynne's Saracenic Rituals chapter, or the Roman contemporary

**[00:57]** historians, you must know that Elephantine and Bubastis were destroyed.

**[01:02]** It's hinted that the priests of Bast were blaspheming against the reigning

**[01:06]** religions and their sacrifices were atrocious. Finally an army was sent

**[01:11]** against their cities and the temples were ravished. But, and this is important,

**[01:15]** the priests were said to have vanished, escaped somewhere with their acolytes.

**[01:19]** They came here. To Cornwall? Exactly. That's why those stupid fools were

**[01:26]** deceived by the minds. Most of them were blinds, with hollow shafts leading to

**[01:30]** temples beneath. But what were they trying to do? The renegade priests knew

**[01:34]** black arts, their worship was perverted, Bast was a Ghoul goddess, remember, and

**[01:40]** her feline fangs must know blood. And besides, the priests were experimenting.

**[01:46]** Somewhere in the old De Mano Lorem it is written that there is a sect of Egypt

**[01:51]** which literally believed in their gods, believed that Anubis, Bast, and Set could

**[01:55]** assume human form. That is to say that the cat goddess could be brought to life.

**[02:16]** Meow meow! Welcome to another episode of Opening the Way. My name is Graham and

**[02:23]** I'll be your host. Hope you're doing well. I'm in rare form today, getting ready to

**[02:30]** talk about another Cthulhu Wars faction. Hopefully you can figure out which one

**[02:36]** that is. I'm just getting into character. I've had some catnip before the show.

**[02:41]** I've got a saucer of milk sitting next to me on the desk. My dog's giving me a

**[02:46]** look like, what the fuck is wrong with you? And we're here. We're here to discuss

**[02:50]** one of the new factions that's coming in Onslaught 4. That would be Boobastis.

**[02:56]** What you heard in the intro there was a short excerpt from The Cult of Boobastis

**[03:02]** by our boy Robert Block, which we've talked about before. Definitely check out

**[03:06]** Robert Block. Read his stuff. Read Psycho. Check out Mysteries of the Worm. That's

**[03:12]** where I read this out of. It was like a compilation released of some of the

**[03:15]** cosmic horror that he wrote early on in his career. Most of it's pretty good.

**[03:20]** Without further ado, let's just jump right in and go over the opening

**[03:26]** thoughts on this new faction. I was not around when this Kickstarter started or

**[03:32]** when this idea came to fruition, but my understanding this was like an April

**[03:36]** Fool's joke, but it was actually ended up becoming a real thing. Very strange, but

**[03:42]** not super out of the blue. If you read the Dreamlands of Unknown Kadath story,

**[03:49]** there's quite a lot of cats featuring here. I don't know that it's confirmed

**[03:54]** through historians or scholars, but I'm pretty positive Lovecraft was definitely

**[03:59]** a cat person, not a dog person. It shows in some of the writing. It's not

**[04:04]** surprising, I guess, that we ended up with a cat faction. This faction is a

**[04:09]** collection of kitties from different planets. You've got the Earth cats, cats

**[04:14]** from Mars, cats from Saturn, cats from Uranus, and Bastet. This faction is very unusual.

**[04:23]** I would describe it as applying to the Game of Cthulhu lore as a sort of

**[04:30]** prisoner's dilemma. If you don't know what that is, it's a thought experiment.

**[04:35]** The challenge is two completely irrational actors to a choice. You can

**[04:40]** either cooperate with your partner and you both get something mutually good for

**[04:43]** you, or you can betray your partner for an individual reward. In this case, the

**[04:50]** mutual reward is cats not winning the game, and the individual reward is

**[04:54]** somebody thinking, maybe I can race the cats and win for myself. If you'll

**[05:00]** indulge me just for a minute to compare the cats to something from another game,

**[05:05]** I also play quite a bit of Root, and the cats to me are very similar to the

**[05:11]** Vagabond in Root. Without going into too many details, the Vagabond has only one

**[05:18]** piece, they move around the board, it can't be destroyed for any reason, and

**[05:22]** it's kind of just a clock on the game that you need to punch in order to slow

**[05:26]** it down. If you do nothing, it's quite a quick clock and it will win the game

**[05:31]** every time, if not interacted with. You also don't get anything for fighting the

**[05:37]** Vagabond. The same is true here with the cats. I'll expand on this in detail, but

**[05:43]** pretty much you don't really get anything out of fighting this faction.

**[05:47]** You don't get any Gates because cats don't care about Gates. They're just

**[05:51]** approaching the game in a totally different way than any other faction so

**[05:55]** far, and they too are a clock on the game. The only way that you're going to beat

**[06:00]** them is by making sure you can keep pace with them or punch them to slow them

**[06:05]** down. All this being said about the cats not functioning in a normal way to the

**[06:12]** other factions, it makes them a bit unusual, maybe even a bit controversial,

**[06:18]** so I want to acknowledge that at the top of this guide. I think from what I've

**[06:22]** read online, this faction can rub some people the wrong way, and that's okay.

**[06:28]** They're not for everybody, that's fine. My goal here is to try to be as objective

**[06:35]** and comprehensive as possible when making these guides. It's particularly about

**[06:38]** these new factions that folks are maybe now just starting to play with for the

**[06:43]** first time. With this faction even more than with Demon Sultan, I really think

**[06:48]** that if you can go into your first game against Boobastis with at least a basic

**[06:53]** understanding of how it works, you're gonna have a much better experience and

**[06:57]** you're gonna have much less salt about whatever it was that happened in the

**[07:02]** game. This is gonna be a guide first and foremost on how to play Boobastis, but

**[07:06]** it's also going to be like the Demon Sultan guide, a little bit of a know your

**[07:10]** enemy thing. We need to understand how to play this faction, but we also need to

**[07:14]** understand how to hurt this faction in order to have better games of Cthulhu

**[07:19]** Wars with this one in the mix. If you are one of these Boobastis haters online and

**[07:25]** you just really really don't like this faction, you make it through the whole

**[07:28]** guide here and you still think this faction is not acceptable, something is

**[07:33]** wrong with it, it's overPowered. There's a little twist that we can apply to the

**[07:38]** cat faction and I'll talk about that at the end of the guide. Maybe that will be

**[07:41]** useful for you and your friends and family in your play group. Let's do a

**[07:47]** quick faction overview. I've been talking to this point in sort of generalities,

**[07:53]** not in any specific way about the cats. The cats are a doom-loving faction. I

**[08:00]** would describe them as an engine faction, maybe the way that Chochos or Yellow

**[08:04]** Sign or Ancients are in engine faction, but they kind of go about it a little

**[08:10]** bit of a different way. As I said earlier, the cats, they don't care about Gates at

**[08:15]** all. That's mostly because they don't even have any acolytes. They can't

**[08:19]** control Gates. They also can't perform rituals in the normal traditional way in

**[08:25]** the doom phase. However, to make up for lacking both those things, they have

**[08:31]** inability alloraphobia we'll talk more about. It pretty much gives you doom where

**[08:36]** you have different types of cats hanging out with enemy units. And then we also

**[08:42]** have requires attention, which is the cats way of performing a ritual that can

**[08:47]** also earn them explosive amounts of doom. As I said, the cats are a very quick

**[08:53]** on the game that needs to be watched at all times, and very quickly they will run

**[08:59]** away with the game and win before you even know what's happening. So that's why

**[09:03]** it's important to understand how they work a little bit so that you understand

**[09:07]** how exactly to slow them down and handle them at any point in time. Cat players,

**[09:13]** all you need to do really figure out how to do is make sure you maintain your

**[09:17]** account of cats because they're going to be giving you Power. They're also going

**[09:20]** to be your main source of doom. You're going to need to figure out how to best

**[09:24]** position your cats and avoid them getting killed at the wrong time and

**[09:29]** make sure

**[09:30]** Bastet herself is in the right place so that you can score a ton of doom on the doom phase

**[09:36]** all at once.

**[09:39]** Okay let's talk about the cat setup, which already is going to be quite unusual.

**[09:44]** They start with 8 Power.

**[09:46]** Place the moon tile within reach.

**[09:49]** Place 6 earth cats on the moon.

**[09:52]** In a game using high priests, add 1 extra Power each gather Power phase.

**[09:59]** That little rider at the end there about high priests will make sense, but obviously

**[10:03]** this is a cat faction first and foremost.

**[10:05]** There's no Cultists, no humans allowed, it's only cats.

**[10:09]** So what's up with the moon tile?

**[10:11]** Let's talk about the moon.

**[10:13]** Here's the rules surrounding the moon.

**[10:15]** It is only to be used in games featuring Boobastis.

**[10:19]** It counts as a land area with a Boobastist controlled Gate for all purposes, meaning

**[10:25]** the cats are going to gain a doom from it every doom phase.

**[10:30]** Although this is a Gate, control may not be seized by any other faction.

**[10:36]** No other Gate can be built on the moon or moved there except for of course Yogg-Sothoth

**[10:42]** via catnapping ability, which we will talk about later.

**[10:48]** Your units, the cats, can move and be paned freely between the moon and any other map

**[10:53]** area.

**[10:55]** Other factions may move or be paned from the moon to another map area but not the reverse.

**[11:02]** So let's break that down a little bit.

**[11:04]** The moon is adjacent to all areas on the map.

**[11:09]** Even though in the real world our moon is quite far away, in Cthulhu Wars the moon is

**[11:13]** actually quite close to everything.

**[11:16]** It is a bridge the cats can use to get to anywhere they need to go and it might be somewhere

**[11:22]** they send you to the moon.

**[11:24]** And we'll talk a lot more about that in a bit.

**[11:26]** But not being the cats, you cannot travel to the moon, though you will be able to move

**[11:31]** from the moon anywhere you need to go and you should really be using that to your advantage.

**[11:36]** We'll talk more about that too later.

**[11:39]** So how do the cats generate Power exactly?

**[11:43]** Well we've got our controlled Gate on the moon that's going to be providing us to Power

**[11:47]** as we know controlled Gates give us that during gather Power.

**[11:50]** You're also going to get Power for your cats and I'll talk more about that in a bit.

**[11:56]** The unique faction ability of the cats is Lunacy.

**[12:00]** This is an ongoing ability.

**[12:03]** Spellbooks and abilities that affect Cultists can target earth cats as if they are acolytes.

**[12:08]** They cannot be captured as Cultists, nor can they create or control Gates.

**[12:13]** This ability is not optional.

**[12:15]** Sort of a strange, unique faction ability.

**[12:18]** This actually seems like more of a drawback and less of a boon compared to other faction

**[12:25]** abilities.

**[12:26]** It also doesn't do anything if you copy it with Sleeper's Ancient Sorcery.

**[12:31]** More on that in the Sleeper Guide, but just something to call out here.

**[12:35]** Basically all this means is cats don't have any Cultists on their team, but you can target

**[12:42]** the earth cats.

**[12:43]** Anything that would apply here is sort of what you're thinking.

**[12:47]** Dreams, Groth, Zyngaia, things like that, they can all hit the earth cats.

**[12:54]** That's something you should keep in mind if you're playing against the cats.

**[12:57]** The earth cats are the squishiest unit that the cats have.

**[13:01]** They're not quite Cultists.

**[13:03]** They're still monsters.

**[13:04]** They can still capture you.

**[13:06]** You cannot capture them.

**[13:07]** However, they can be targeted by a number of different Spellbooks because of the Lunacy

**[13:13]** ability.

**[13:16]** Let's discuss the Spellbook requirements for the cats.

**[13:19]** First one, as an action, pay 2 Power.

**[13:23]** Very simple, pretty easy to get, I would say, but I don't know that you need to rush for

**[13:29]** it in action phase 1, and that's mainly because some of these other requirements you may want

**[13:35]** to do beforehand.

**[13:37]** This is not a hard thing to accomplish, so don't force it early when you don't need to.

**[13:42]** You might have better ways to spend your Power.

**[13:45]** Good segue into the second Spellbook requirement, which is no earth cats on the moon.

**[13:52]** You've got 6 earth cats to start the game with, so you're going to need to spend at

**[13:56]** least 6 Power in order to earn this book.

**[14:00]** Again, the moon is adjacent to every area, so you can get anywhere you need to go here.

**[14:07]** Importantly, cats are also monsters.

**[14:10]** They are not Cultists, so they are able to capture.

**[14:13]** They're really in position right at the start of the game to be capturing units, kind of

**[14:19]** where you wouldn't expect them to be.

**[14:21]** The cats are going to have a warping effect on the game, at least early on, if not in

**[14:25]** the mid and late game, of really deterring acolytes from hanging out by themselves because

**[14:31]** they're going to put themselves in harm's way.

**[14:33]** There's always going to be a cat nearby, whether it's on earth or whatever map you're

**[14:38]** playing on, or it's just one space away on the moon, so be careful about that.

**[14:44]** When you're working to get this no earth cats on the moon Spellbook requirement, just again

**[14:49]** reminder, stagger your actions.

**[14:51]** You don't need to pay 2 or 3 Power and move 3 cats at once.

**[14:55]** You can definitely get away with, early on for sure, moving one earth cat at a time whenever

**[15:00]** it's your turn.

**[15:02]** Just do this, stagger this one out, take as long as possible, you'll be glad you did.

**[15:07]** Next Spellbook requirement, a cat is in every enemy faction's starting area.

**[15:13]** You then gain 1 Power per enemy faction.

**[15:16]** This Spellbook requirement feels a bit similar to the black goat requirement of sharing areas

**[15:21]** with all enemies.

**[15:22]** As the cats, you don't actually have any Cultists that get captured, all of your units are monsters,

**[15:28]** so you don't need to worry about getting captured, but you do need to worry about people

**[15:32]** fighting you.

**[15:33]** Your cats start on the moon, and the moon is adjacent everywhere, so at the end of the

**[15:38]** day I actually think this Spellbook requirement is also quite easy to earn, especially when

**[15:44]** factions are going to start taking turns off to summon their great old ones.

**[15:48]** That's a great time to freely move a cat in to someone's start area and earn a bit of

**[15:54]** Power for earning this requirement.

**[15:58]** Next requirement, pretty straightforward, a cat from Mars or a cat from Saturn is killed

**[16:03]** or eliminated.

**[16:05]** These are monsters we'll talk about soon that have costs of 2 and 3 respectively, so preferably

**[16:11]** you would want to get a cat from Mars killed because they're a little bit cheaper to summon.

**[16:18]** You are going to want to be fighting battles as the cats in order to get some cats killed

**[16:23]** and earn your Spellbook, so keep that in mind.

**[16:28]** Just good rule of thumb, kill your cheapest units preferably.

**[16:33]** Next Spellbook requirement, cat from Uranus is killed or eliminated.

**[16:37]** I don't have that much to say about this one, cats from Uranus we'll talk about.

**[16:41]** They are expensive, they cost 4 Power, they have actually quite a bit of combat, and their

**[16:47]** Spellbook that works with them is quite strong.

**[16:50]** You need to lose one, so you need to set up a battle which hurts somebody, ideally, while

**[16:55]** you're doing that.

**[16:57]** This can be a bit of a tricky Spellbook requirement to earn.

**[17:01]** In my limited playing with cats, I've seen quite a few games where this is the last Spellbook

**[17:06]** that the cats need to earn and they're having a hard time doing so.

**[17:09]** Take your opportunities to earn this Spellbook seriously and try to go for it when you can.

**[17:18]** Last Spellbook requirement for the cats is Awaken Bastet.

**[17:22]** This is your quote-unquote great old one, it's actually an Elder God, I'll explain the

**[17:27]** difference between them very soon.

**[17:31]** Pretty much what you need to know about this Spellbook requirement is Bastet is not the

**[17:34]** easiest Elder God to awaken.

**[17:37]** You need all of your cat varieties in play, that's going to cost you at least 7 Power

**[17:44]** to do, and you're going to need to pay 6 Power, and you're going to need to be in an area

**[17:49]** with no enemy units.

**[17:51]** You're probably not going to be able to do this super early on.

**[17:56]** It's possible to do this in Action Phase 2, but I think more likely you'll do it in Action

**[18:01]** Phase 3 typically.

**[18:05]** Okay, we're ready to move on to the Boobastis units.

**[18:11]** The cats do not have any Cultists, they have no humans that can be captured.

**[18:15]** Instead, this entire faction is their Elder God Bastet, and everything else is a monster,

**[18:22]** which is varying kinds of cats.

**[18:24]** Since you don't have acolytes, all of your cats have a special ability where they generate

**[18:30]** 1 Power during the Gather Power.

**[18:33]** This is key to playing the cats, is maintaining your count of cats.

**[18:38]** The more cats you keep alive, the more Power that you have, and if you're playing against

**[18:43]** the cats, the more cats that you can kill, the less Power that the cat player will have.

**[18:50]** I'll talk more about that later when we talk about thwarting the cats.

**[18:55]** First unit, Earth cats.

**[18:57]** They're very cute.

**[18:58]** They look a little bit like the hairless...

**[19:01]** I'm not a cat person, so I really don't know what this breed of cat is called.

**[19:06]** The hairless ones, like the Dr. Evil kind of cats.

**[19:10]** I wouldn't want to own one, not to yuck anyone's yum.

**[19:13]** If you have one, I'm sure they're sweet.

**[19:15]** Please write me an email, I'd love to hear about your cat and see a picture of it.

**[19:20]** Earth cats, they cost one, they've got zero combat, they're a monster obviously, and they

**[19:25]** will generate a Power during gather Power.

**[19:29]** The Spellbook that works with earth cats is Catabolism.

**[19:33]** Its ongoing ability, earth cats can recruit monsters as if the monsters were Cultists

**[19:38]** instead of needing to summon them.

**[19:41]** We'll talk more about Catabolism soon, but just a note, earth cats cannot control Gates,

**[19:47]** therefore you cannot summon other cats in any area other than the moon, and that's because

**[19:52]** the moon counts as a Boobastist controlled Gate.

**[19:56]** It can be a good idea to take this Spellbook early so that you unlock the ability to recruit

**[20:01]** your other varieties of cats where you want to, on the earth, on the map, wherever you're

**[20:05]** playing, instead of always summoning them on the moon and then having to move them.

**[20:12]** Next up we have the cats from Mars.

**[20:15]** You've got two of them, they cost two, they have a combat of one.

**[20:18]** These ones look a bit like some kind of, like maybe a wildcat.

**[20:24]** Everything almost normal until you notice that it has an extra set of limbs, and then

**[20:28]** it's starting to look very alien and otherworldly from there.

**[20:33]** These are your cheapest units that can actually roll combat, and they only roll one, but they

**[20:38]** have a pretty useful Spellbook in Zagazig, which swaps your kill and pain results, making

**[20:45]** it more likely that you will roll kills in combat and your opponent as well.

**[20:51]** That's going to help you earn a Spellbook requirement.

**[20:56]** Next is the cats from Saturn.

**[20:58]** You've got two of them, they cost three, they have two combat.

**[21:03]** They only vaguely look like cats in their general shape.

**[21:10]** Regrettably they have a big eye, they're like cyclopean cats.

**[21:16]** I'm not interested at all in having one of these as a pet, I kind of want them to be

**[21:19]** as far away from me as possible.

**[21:22]** A little bit more expensive than the cats from Mars, they roll slightly more dice to

**[21:25]** make up for it, and they have a pretty spicy Spellbook in Savagery where they can pay one

**[21:31]** Power before the battle to increase the number of dice they roll by four.

**[21:36]** Makes a nice pairing with cats from Mars and the Zagazig book in order to try to roll more

**[21:41]** kills, and we can talk more about how to set up those nice cat battles a little bit later.

**[21:49]** Last monster from cats is the cats from Uranus.

**[21:52]** You've got two of them, they cost four, and they have a combat of three.

**[21:57]** These ones, they don't appear to have any eyes.

**[22:01]** They kind of give me a little bit of a xenomorph vibe with the way their head is shaped and

**[22:07]** kind of the blind, blank faceness of them.

**[22:11]** They look like they would fuck you up, so I also don't really want any of these as a

**[22:16]** pet.

**[22:17]** These units are pretty expensive at four cost, that's like among the most expensive monsters

**[22:22]** that any faction has.

**[22:24]** You need to get one of them killed, as I said, that can be kind of tricky.

**[22:27]** If you're playing against savvy players, they're going to try to avoid getting into conflicts

**[22:31]** just to deny you your Spellbook requirements, so be careful when you summon this one since

**[22:37]** it's quite a bit of Power.

**[22:40]** The Spellbook that works with cats from Uranus is Predator.

**[22:43]** After the battle, you pick a unit which was killed and your opponent needs to remove another

**[22:49]** one of that type from anywhere on the map.

**[22:52]** This makes the Uranus cats good at hunting for other valuable, expensive units such as

**[22:58]** a formless spawn, a spawn of yog, maybe a demon sultan larvae of a particular type,

**[23:04]** things like that.

**[23:08]** The last unit for Boobastis that we have to talk about is Bastet herself.

**[23:13]** Bastet is an Elder God.

**[23:16]** If you don't know what that is, I understand.

**[23:19]** They're sort of the benevolent equivalent to the Great Old Ones, at least that's how

**[23:23]** I read them when I heard about them in the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath.

**[23:29]** Other authors have expanded on this concept a bit more.

**[23:32]** August Durlith would be one.

**[23:35]** He was, if you don't know, sorry we're going on a literary tangent, just hang in there.

**[23:40]** Durlith was the editor, I believe, and publisher of the Weird Tales magazine.

**[23:46]** That's where a lot of these Lovecraft stories first appeared in the public was Weird Tales.

**[23:51]** He went on to write a lot himself, sort of develop this cosmic horror mythology.

**[23:58]** Durlith wanted to distinguish his creations from the mindless, amoral Great Old Ones,

**[24:06]** so he kind of came up with this concept of Elder Gods and expanded on it a little bit

**[24:10]** more.

**[24:11]** Roll's text for Elder Gods.

**[24:14]** These beings are treated as Great Old Ones for all purposes, except they do not provide

**[24:18]** an Elder Sign inherently when you perform a Ritual of Annihilation, though they often

**[24:25]** have other means of creating Elder Signs.

**[24:28]** Elder Gods never roll combat dice, therefore they cannot declare battles, but they provide

**[24:33]** some fixed benefit.

**[24:35]** They do count as equal to Great Old Ones otherwise, so they can block unit captures.

**[24:42]** You can still use Elder Gods to capture enemy Cultists even if an enemy monster is present

**[24:47]** and so forth.

**[24:48]** You're still going to get the benefits from Harbinger, for example, for killing or painting

**[24:54]** an Elder God.

**[24:56]** If you're wondering if there's any other Elder Gods in Cthulhu horrors, one of them is Nodens,

**[25:00]** and that's a neutral unit.

**[25:02]** I will cover it at some point.

**[25:05]** How to awaken Bastet.

**[25:07]** Number one, all of your cat varieties are in play.

**[25:10]** As I said, that's going to be 2 Power for a Mars cat, 3 Power for a Saturn cat, 4 Power

**[25:15]** for a Uranus cat.

**[25:16]** You're going to need all those in play, and Earth cat, obviously.

**[25:21]** Number two, Pasek's Power.

**[25:23]** Number three, place Bastet in an area containing no enemy units.

**[25:27]** There doesn't need to be a Gate there, you don't need to have cats there, you just need

**[25:32]** to place it in an area with no enemy units.

**[25:36]** Bastet's combat, as we said earlier with Elder Gods, they actually don't roll dice.

**[25:41]** They cannot declare combat, but they do have some benefits in combat.

**[25:46]** Add one kill to your combat total.

**[25:48]** The enemy must lower their kill total by one.

**[25:51]** So anytime Bastet gets into a scrap, you have a little bit of a buffer saving her from

**[25:57]** getting killed, and she's going to apply a kill no matter what, so if an enemy is going

**[26:02]** to fight Bastet, they'd best be bringing more than just Gnarlathotep, otherwise that unit's

**[26:07]** getting killed.

**[26:11]** The ability on Bastet is requires attention.

**[26:15]** This is a doom phase ability.

**[26:16]** During the doom phase, if Bastet is in an area containing an enemy Cultist, you may

**[26:21]** perform a Ritual of Annihilation.

**[26:25]** For you, this adds exactly four doom, plus if Bastet's area has an enemy controlled Gate,

**[26:31]** gain one Elder Sign.

**[26:33]** If Bastet's area has an enemy great old one, gain two Elder Signs, and these rewards are

**[26:39]** additive.

**[26:41]** So if you weren't already thinking this, I will just confirm for you, requires attention

**[26:46]** is the win condition for cats.

**[26:48]** They don't control Gates, so they need some way to accumulate doom quickly.

**[26:53]** Remember, the moon is going to provide them one doom a turn.

**[26:58]** If you are able to do requires attention, you're going to be getting the equivalent

**[27:02]** of four doom, which is a lot, and if you're able to meet any of those other requirements

**[27:07]** you may be getting as much as five doom plus three Elder Signs due to this ability.

**[27:13]** That's a lot of doom, that's almost ten doom.

**[27:17]** If you set yourself up for this, you can win the game very quickly.

**[27:21]** I'm talking other players are maybe at twenty doom and the game's over because you just

**[27:27]** got ten or twelve doom from this.

**[27:30]** The Spellbook that works with Bastet is catnapping.

**[27:35]** It's a one cost action.

**[27:36]** You can choose any or all enemy factions in Bastet's area and you just send them all to

**[27:41]** the moon.

**[27:43]** We'll talk more about that pretty quickly.

**[27:46]** I think this is one of the stronger abilities we've seen in Cthulhu Wars so far.

**[27:50]** This is one of the main reasons I wanted to write this guide, because I can say personally

**[27:54]** I'm not ashamed to admit the first time I played against the cats and was hit with catnapping,

**[27:59]** I was very salty.

**[28:02]** I don't want you to be salty during your first games with the cats.

**[28:06]** Hopefully a lot of people hear this episode and you can have a better experience the first

**[28:11]** time you see the cats and then in every subsequent time.

**[28:14]** That's the goal here.

**[28:16]** Let's just segue right into Spellbooks and talk about catnapping proper.

**[28:20]** It's a one cost action that only Bastet can do.

**[28:24]** Choose any or all enemy factions in Bastet's area, move all units belonging to those factions

**[28:29]** from that area to the moon.

**[28:31]** on the moon leaves, you gain Power equal to what they spent on movement. Pretty strong

**[28:38]** ability, it's quite good. Specifically, you want to be using this ability mainly on big

**[28:44]** clumps of units if possible. Ideally big clumps of units that don't roll a lot of dice so

**[28:50]** that you can maximize the Power gained as they move off the moon. Notably, the cats

**[28:55]** are only getting Power when units are moving off the moon, but if units get paned off the

**[29:00]** moon, the cats don't get anything for that. So try to avoid missing out on that Power.

**[29:05]** One thing you might do but is not ideal is to put two armies on the moon that can roll

**[29:10]** a lot of dice. Those armies are going to be really stoked to fight each other and pane

**[29:15]** themselves out of the moon and give you nothing for putting them up there. So ideally, you're

**[29:21]** able to find a clump of crawling chaos acolytes with a Nightgaunt or something. Something

**[29:26]** that rolls not a lot of dice but is maybe a lot of units or maybe early cho-chos with

**[29:33]** several acolytes, a high priest, maybe a proto-shoggah. Put something like that up the moon. Don't

**[29:38]** put a Cthulhu death ball up the moon unless they're the only people up there.

**[29:44]** The other thing you've got to keep in mind, people are going to be mad at you when you

**[29:47]** do this and the moon is adjacent to all areas so nobody can hide from the cats but you also

**[29:52]** really can't hide from the other players. So keep that in mind, keep that in your calculations

**[29:56]** as you put people on the moon. Think about where they might want to move afterward. Are

**[30:01]** they going to come after you? Are they going to come after a Gate because literally every

**[30:05]** Gate is adjacent to the moon? Use your table talk, try to talk it out. They're not going

**[30:11]** to really want to cooperate with you but see if you can convince them to not come after

**[30:16]** you directly after you put them on the moon.

**[30:19]** The next Spellbook is Catbolism which we mentioned earlier. Earth cats can recruit monsters as

**[30:25]** if the monsters were Cultists instead of needing to summon them. So unless you have this book,

**[30:30]** you're always going to be summoning cats of any variety on the moon specifically and nowhere

**[30:35]** else. If you get this book, essentially you're going to be saving on Power because you'll

**[30:40]** be able to recruit your cats next to your earth cats on earth on whatever map instead

**[30:45]** of summoning on the moon and then having to move them. Do recommend this as a book

**[30:50]** to take quite early, maybe one of the first few books you take.

**[30:57]** Next Spellbook, Predator. It's a post-battle ability. If a cat from Uranus was in the battle,

**[31:02]** you can select one unit lost by the enemy. They must eliminate a second unit of that

**[31:07]** type anywhere on the map if possible. Basically, if you got your Uranus cat in the battle and

**[31:12]** you managed to roll multiple kills, that's great. Hopefully, your opponent knows to apply

**[31:18]** them to the right units. If they're stuck in a spot where they have to apply them to

**[31:22]** something expensive, they might really be feeling bad because you're going to be able

**[31:26]** to kill something else somewhere on the map for free. That can be very, very strong.

**[31:33]** You want to maximize Predator. Just be hunting for those expensive units that there might

**[31:38]** not be many of. There might be endangered species, like a formless spawn. Just make

**[31:44]** sure that you can make them extinct. That can be very effective.

**[31:49]** Next Spellbook is Zagazig. That's a pre-battle ability. If a cat from Mars is in the battle,

**[31:56]** all rolled pains become kills and all rolled kills become pains. Recall that the combat

**[32:01]** dice in Cthulhu Wars, they've got three blanks, two pains, and one kill. If you reverse the

**[32:07]** pains and kills, you effectively made it so you and your opponent have now a one in

**[32:13]** three chance of rolling a kill, rather than a one in six chance of rolling a kill. That's

**[32:17]** a pretty significant upgrade. Great way to get your cats killed, but also to inflict

**[32:23]** kills on others. You're going to get rewarded as the cats for setting yourself up for proper

**[32:29]** battles, and Zagazig is going to help you really do that. The best battles are going

**[32:34]** to be with multiple varieties of cats, and that's going to make more sense as you understand

**[32:39]** all of these cat-based Spellbooks that work with battle.

**[32:44]** Next Spellbook is Savagery. It's also a pre-battle ability. Pay one Power to increase the combat

**[32:50]** of all cats from Saturn by four for this battle. Pretty simple. I don't usually like paying

**[32:56]** Power unless I need to, but as we know, the cats from Saturn only roll two dice, so being

**[33:03]** able to pay one and make them roll six dice instead is kind of a big deal. Again, if you're

**[33:07]** able to somehow combine a battle with cats from Saturn, Mars, and Uranus, you're going

**[33:13]** to be rolling a lot of dice, and you're going to be rolling a lot of kills. Try to engineer

**[33:18]** those combats so that they work out in your favor for earning your Spellbooks, or by wiping

**[33:23]** somebody else out who's a threat to you.

**[33:26]** Last Spellbook here is Alloraphobia. That's the fear of cats, if you don't know what that

**[33:31]** is. During the doom phase, gain one doom per monster cat variety, sharing a non-moon

**[33:39]** area with units from enemy factions. I want to emphasize that point, non-moon area. It's

**[33:47]** come to my attention as well that the cat faction being printed in real life, it does

**[33:53]** have a typo here, or a misprint rather. Alloraphobia, as written on the card, does not specify non-moon

**[34:02]** area, but I think at this point it's been officially confirmed it is meant to be non-moon

**[34:07]** area, and there is going to be a sticker or some sort of a reprint to address this, so

**[34:14]** just so you know, house ruled for now. It should be non-moon area.

**[34:20]** Essentially with Alloraphobia, you've got four different cat varieties. Earth cats, Mars, Saturn, Uranus cats.

**[34:26]** Potentially you could gain four doom from this. This is one of the main reasons why

**[34:32]** enemies are going to want to fight you and keep you away from their Gates no matter what

**[34:36]** kind of cats are there. Besides, Bastet requires attention ability. This is going to be the

**[34:41]** other way that the cats are going to accumulate a lot of doom very fast. In combination with

**[34:48]** your moon-controlled Gate and requires attention, the cats have a potential of earning nine

**[34:55]** doom plus three alder signs in a single doom phase. That is not to be messed with. That's

**[35:01]** a minimum of twelve doom. A minimum of twelve doom. Possibly as high as, you know, fifteen

**[35:07]** doom in one turn.

**[35:11]** Hey, EditingGram here. I'm actually going to do the section on openings for Boobastis

**[35:18]** because I listened to what RecordingGram had for this and it just was not that good. RecordingGram

**[35:26]** usually writes an outline, didn't have one here. I'm a lot, not a lot older, but probably

**[35:32]** a little bit smarter than RecordingGram and I've actually played a couple more games of

**[35:36]** Boobastis since the time of the initial recording, so I'll give you my more well-constructed

**[35:42]** thoughts on the openings. When playing the cats, when opening up with the cats, I see

**[35:48]** there's two main things that you can do. One of those would be moving your earth cats.

**[35:56]** The other one is going to be summoning different cat varieties. Of course, there's lots and

**[36:01]** lots of combinations in between those things. RecordingGram's getting caught up in that.

**[36:07]** I'm not going to. I'm going to speak more generally. You're going to have to kind of

**[36:12]** adapt and improvise which of these you want to do over time. First thing you want to know

**[36:18]** as opening up as the cats, as playing the cats, is that all players should know that

**[36:25]** there's a new rule layer on this game, a new thing everyone needs to be aware of. What

**[36:32]** I mean by that is this is very similar to Crawling Chaos and Madness, and that is the

**[36:38]** earth cats just being near all Gates right from the start of the game. The new rule is

**[36:43]** if you want to go move out and build a Gate, you're going to need to move a monster first

**[36:49]** in order to do that safely. If you don't, an earth cat can just pop down and you're

**[36:54]** forced to either flee or build a Gate and get captured. You don't want to do that. Notably,

**[37:01]** the only faction that's immune to this kind of thing is my beloved black goat, and that's

**[37:07]** because they have fertility cult. They could build a Gate and then summon a monster right

**[37:12]** away before the cats get a chance to capture. If nobody is respecting your earth cats, start

**[37:20]** moving down that path of getting your earth cats into enemy start areas and getting all

**[37:26]** of your earth cats off the moon. That's what I would recommend. If you did go the earth

**[37:32]** cat route, you're probably not going to get Bastet until action phase 3, so in action

**[37:37]** phase 2, just focus on getting the rest of your cat varieties out on the board, and that's

**[37:43]** going to set you up for an awakening in action phase 3 and some Power left over to spare

**[37:49]** in order to mess with people, move your cats around, move Bastet into the position to maybe

**[37:55]** start catnapping people and things like that. If however everybody's being safe, everybody

**[38:02]** is

**[38:02]** moving their monsters prior to creating a Gate like they should be. From there

**[38:08]** your earth cats in enemy areas, aside from the start areas, is not going to be

**[38:13]** super effective so at that point you can feel free to maybe try to summon some of

**[38:19]** those other cat varieties. You'll have your 8 starting Power and you could

**[38:25]** summon a Uranus cat for 4 and then a Saturn cat for 3. That would be most of

**[38:30]** your 8 Power and then maybe move an earth cat. You can do, like I said, any

**[38:34]** combination in between. If you summon a couple of cat varieties instead of

**[38:38]** moving earth cats you should have by the next action phase 10 Power. That should

**[38:43]** be enough to summon whichever off-world cat you're missing and Bastet and of

**[38:49]** course you won't be able to do much else. As we know that's fine, a lot of people

**[38:53]** are taking the turn off anyway to awaken their great old ones. You want to know

**[38:59]** the greediest opening that gets you the most amount of spell books quickly. I'd

**[39:03]** say it's kind of the perfect middle ground between these two. Assuming it's a

**[39:07]** four-player game, you'll spend 6 Power moving your earth cats off the moon, 3

**[39:11]** into enemy starting areas. That will gain you some Power back and you'll be

**[39:15]** left with 5. That will be exactly enough to summon a Saturn cat and a Mars cat.

**[39:20]** Next turn you'll have exactly enough for a Uranus cat and Bastet. The greed of

**[39:26]** this one comes from the fact that it relies on nobody touching your cats. I

**[39:30]** think once you've played with this faction and everyone kind of understands

**[39:34]** the right way to police them, you'll be looking for that kind of thing and I

**[39:39]** think generally it will be better to get your spell books a bit more slowly. You

**[39:43]** don't need to move out all those earth cats. You can set yourself up that you

**[39:47]** have plenty of Power to move some of them, get one or two cat varieties, and

**[39:52]** get Bastet sometime in action phase 2 or action phase 3. Like I said, there is

**[39:58]** like a whole spectrum here so I didn't really want to recommend any one

**[40:02]** particular opening. Hopefully this rerecording is not too jarring so I will

**[40:08]** throw it back to Recording Graham who can go over tips and tricks for playing

**[40:15]** the cats. Maybe I'll interject there too. You never know what I might do. I'm much

**[40:19]** more Powerful than Recording Graham is.

**[40:24]** Let's transition into playing the cats tips and tricks. First thing, kind of your

**[40:30]** Achilles heel, if it's not already clear, is your cat count because that is what

**[40:35]** is determining your Power. You only actually have 14 potential Power a turn

**[40:41]** if you're not counting anything you might earn from catnapping. That'd be

**[40:44]** like 2 Power from the moon, 6 Power from earth cats, 6 Powers from having each

**[40:49]** of your other cats in play. Factions that can care about Gates and control Gates

**[40:53]** can easily get close to 20 Power if things are going really well for them.

**[40:57]** You're going to need to summon or recruit your cats and keep them alive,

**[41:02]** capture when you're able to, and use catnapping to get more Power and not get

**[41:08]** starved. Rituals, if you're playing with certain faction mix, rituals are going to

**[41:12]** start to become pretty expensive. You don't want to get into a point where you

**[41:16]** are struggling to pay for a ritual and you don't have a lot of cats. That's a

**[41:21]** good way of getting wiped out is like, I don't know, you pay 8 Power for requires

**[41:25]** attention and you only started the phase with 11 Power, you might be in trouble at

**[41:30]** that point. Try to avoid getting into that position. One thing you can do

**[41:34]** here, I'd say specifically with the earth cats since they can't roll combat, yes

**[41:39]** you need to put them into the enemy start areas for a Spellbook requirement

**[41:44]** but otherwise earth cats really like to fuck off and be left alone in unoccupied

**[41:49]** areas. I think that's a great location for the earth cats. Force players, if they

**[41:53]** want to take your Power, don't make it easy for them. All this is being said

**[41:58]** with like a big caveat of alloraphobia. You do want to have your cats in

**[42:02]** position at the end of the action phase specifically so that you can earn doom

**[42:06]** later. During the action phase, try to make your cats not hang out in vulnerable

**[42:13]** areas where there's a lot of conflict because it's going to be more likely

**[42:16]** that they get killed that way. I said this at the top but cats don't have any

**[42:21]** acolytes. Everything they have is a monster. Everything is adjacent to the

**[42:25]** moon so captures in the early game are very easy if the players are underprepared.

**[42:30]** So take advantage of that. Somebody moves to build a Gate, just move an

**[42:35]** earth cat there. Give them the choice. Move again, really kind of mess up your

**[42:40]** action phase one opening or let the cat capture you. You just don't want to do

**[42:45]** that. Bastet is your best tool for getting that explosive doom from

**[42:51]** requires attention. Again, Bastet's gonna like reduce the kills rolled against

**[42:57]** her by one which is great but try to keep Bastet out of harm's way. You

**[43:02]** really only want to like be tempting fate with Bastet right toward the end of

**[43:06]** the action phase and that's because you want to be putting Bastet into a

**[43:09]** location where you can do requires attention ideally with the extra elder

**[43:15]** signs attached. Like we said earlier, the rituals are going to start becoming

**[43:20]** expensive especially depending on what factions are in the game. If Cho's or

**[43:25]** ancients or something like that are in the game, they're gonna get up there very

**[43:28]** fast. You really don't need to do requires attention too many times. If you

**[43:33]** are able to do this with the Elder Signs attached and get some amount of doom from

**[43:38]** alloraphobia, the game's over just mathematically. If you're able to gain

**[43:43]** like something like 20 doom from doing this twice, you should have no trouble

**[43:47]** like cleaning up the rest of the game. So obviously strive for getting those elder

**[43:52]** sign requirements met for requires attention but even just being in an area

**[43:57]** with a Cultist is gonna earn you you know the four doom and the one doom from

**[44:02]** the moon which is still respectable. And remember we also have alloraphobia so

**[44:07]** even if we aren't able to do requires attention for the full benefits, we still

**[44:11]** can get a respectable amount of doom here. On alloraphobia we want to basically

**[44:17]** the trick with the cats is preserving your cats during the action phase. Of

**[44:24]** course you need to get some killed but after you do, preserve your cats because

**[44:28]** that's going to preserve your Power count. And really what we want to be

**[44:32]** striving for is at the end of the action phase all of our cat varieties are in

**[44:36]** position for maximum alloraphobia and ideally Bastet is in position for

**[44:41]** requires attention. You don't need to work very hard for alloraphobia in order

**[44:46]** to earn two to four passive doom. Take advantage of the moon being adjacent

**[44:51]** everywhere and your ability to move to the moon in order to put your kitties

**[44:55]** into undefended areas. You don't want people to be able to fight you, kill you,

**[45:00]** push you away from the areas that you're interested in. Last thing, you've got to

**[45:06]** pretty strong potential for combat as I've been intimating, particularly if all

**[45:12]** the cat varieties are in battle together. With one of each cat you're going to be

**[45:17]** rolling six dice. If you pay one for savagery that's ten dice. If you use

**[45:22]** zag-zig you're increasing the kills that you can roll and after the battle you

**[45:27]** might be sniping other units elsewhere on the map with predator. And of course

**[45:32]** if Bastet's in the battle you're going to be rolling an additional kill. Although

**[45:37]** the cats don't have a death ball, although they don't really have a way to

**[45:42]** transport their units cheaply like with a submerge or an arctic wind, they are

**[45:48]** pretty formidable in a straight-up fight. So I'm actually not feeling too bad

**[45:53]** about cats getting into a conflict with like any faction that can roll a lot of

**[45:57]** dice. I think they can really hang with even the fightiest factions in the game.

**[46:01]** Let's talk about how to thwart the cats, how to effectively play against the cats.

**[46:10]** First thing, try to avoid getting catnapped if possible. It's hard to

**[46:15]** avoid this honestly if the cat player knows what they're doing, but it is what

**[46:19]** it is. Really you don't want to be caught anywhere near Boobastis with a clump of

**[46:23]** units and not have the Power to declare a battle against them or the odds are

**[46:29]** you're gonna find yourself up on the moon and you're gonna be unhappy about

**[46:32]** it. Try to talk it out with anybody else that's on the moon. Ideally you fight

**[46:37]** each other, you pain yourselves out of the moon so as to not provide the cats

**[46:41]** with any extra Power. Remember that awakening Boobastis requires all the cat

**[46:48]** varieties to be in play, so if you're ever able to prevent that from happening

**[46:53]** that's going to prevent Boobastis from being awakened again. This is going to

**[46:58]** sound counterintuitive because the cats do need to get a cat killed for their

**[47:02]** Spellbook, but once that happens already the first time I recommend targeting the

**[47:07]** Uranus cats because they're the most expensive for the cats to recruit and

**[47:11]** really every Power is precious to them so anything you can do to make their

**[47:15]** life more expensive is worth doing. Pretty obvious tip, but if you have the

**[47:21]** opportunity definitely kill Boobastis. Everybody needs to be on the same page

**[47:26]** when it comes to require attention because we do not want cats to be able

**[47:31]** to score more than 10 doom in one day.

**[47:33]** turn and end the game before everybody else has a chance to even get past 20 doom or in some cases

**[47:39]** even earn all their Spellbooks. That's a bad look. That's just a failure of table politics which

**[47:45]** I'm overdue for writing an episode on that and I want to try to get that one out sooner rather

**[47:50]** than later because I think a lot of games are going to fall apart against these new factions

**[47:54]** if players are not talking to each other and discussing what the best course of action is

**[47:59]** for the group. My suggestion for the cats would be forming what I'm calling a kitty committee

**[48:06]** with the other players and that is just a social contract where everybody commits to

**[48:11]** policing the cats. Everybody's paying attention, everybody's looking for what is the lore phobia

**[48:17]** going to look like in the doom phase, what is requires attention going to look like during the

**[48:21]** doom phase. Everyone's going to be having to pitch in and break up some of these cats,

**[48:27]** push the cat varieties out of your Gates, make a lore phobia less effective, make it so that

**[48:33]** requires attention is less effective. If somebody doesn't want to follow the prisoner's dilemma,

**[48:40]** if they want to break from the kitty committee and they're not cooperating to punch cats anymore,

**[48:46]** they can't be trusted. You shouldn't do anything for them. In fact, you shouldn't throw them under

**[48:50]** the bus as far as I'm concerned. They might be the reason that the game is lost to the cats so

**[48:56]** try to maintain the integrity of the kitty committee at all times if possible.

**[49:01]** On a lore phobia, just try to avoid providing any more than one or two passive doom.

**[49:08]** Anything that you can do to keep the cat varieties out of areas with the non-cat

**[49:12]** players which is going to require cooperation. A good way of thinking about this is just the

**[49:18]** cats being in Gated areas is equivalent to the cats controlling Gates in that it's going to

**[49:22]** provide Boobastis with one doom during the doom phase. Train your eyes so that you can clearly see

**[49:28]** when the cats are infesting the board in an undesirable way. Figure out your best ways to

**[49:34]** roll many dice or ensuring cats get killed or paned out of your way. Some factions don't roll as

**[49:42]** many combat dice as other factions. Yellow sign, great example. They're going to have a more

**[49:46]** difficult time getting rid of the cats with just the raw combat but the good news is that there

**[49:53]** should be some tools that you can use to get out of this. I don't have an exhaustive list but just

**[49:58]** as an example, the earth cats are treated as though they are Cultists. That's important.

**[50:04]** One thing yellow sign can do against the cats though they're not able to really effectively

**[50:09]** combat the cats, Zingaya targets Cultists and therefore you can actually hit the earth cats

**[50:15]** and turn them into undead. That's a really cheap and effective way of yellow sign taking out cats

**[50:21]** therefore reducing the potential Power that the Boobastis player has and forcing them to

**[50:27]** summon those earth cats back on the moon or recruit them elsewhere. One other faction I

**[50:34]** want to shout out that's like very adept at fighting the cats is the sleeper with the

**[50:39]** capture monster ability. Assuming Boobastis is not in the picture and nearby, capture monster,

**[50:46]** if you're able to lethargy out the cats and hang out you can just devastate these cat varieties

**[50:51]** with capture monster. They can't really do anything about it. I think this is probably

**[50:55]** the most effective way to get rid of the cat varieties because you don't even need to fight

**[51:00]** them or put yourself at risk. Everybody wants to know at the end here maybe some closing thoughts.

**[51:07]** Is this faction overPowered? Is it unbalanced? I've not played really tons of games against the

**[51:12]** cats to make that determination but I'm tending toward no although maybe there's some really

**[51:18]** adept cat players that might make me think otherwise. I'm hoping that your understanding

**[51:24]** of the cats has improved a great deal by listening to this guide and that's just going to make your

**[51:28]** first experiences against the cats just a better overall positive experience. If however after

**[51:35]** some games against Boobastis all your friends are mad, everybody's pissed about catnapping,

**[51:40]** everybody's mad about requires attention, everybody's calling for this faction to be banned

**[51:44]** at your table, I've got a little bit of good news for you from the Cthulhu Wars discord. Many people

**[51:51]** did have this problem with this faction. I don't speak for the entire community here but if you do

**[51:57]** think this faction is problematic, here is a little bit of a tweak you can try to the Boobastis

**[52:02]** faction in order to make it a bit more palatable, maybe change up the play style a little bit.

**[52:08]** We've been calling this one Noobastis. This is just going to require a couple of different

**[52:14]** changes here to only two spell books so not a heavy lift. Most of the faction remains intact

**[52:19]** however we are going to drop Alluraphobia and we're going to drop Catabolism. These seemingly

**[52:25]** are the most problematic. Alluraphobia is just a bunch of free doom with not a lot of work to

**[52:31]** earn it. Catabolism kind of just makes your cats everywhere at once. Taking this away kind of makes

**[52:37]** sense, makes it more expensive for the cats to get into position and we're replacing those spell books

**[52:42]** with two new spell books. One of them is Syzygy. During the doom phase, if you've got no units on

**[52:48]** the moon, gain an Elder Sign. Very simple, kind of a toned down equivalent of Alluraphobia that is

**[52:54]** not dependent on your cats being in enemy areas but more dependent on you managing your cats

**[53:01]** in the locations that they are, namely not on the moon. Second spell book, Carnivore. Post-battle

**[53:08]** ability, gain one doom for every unit killed or eliminated in the battle. These changes are both

**[53:15]** pretty simple and essentially what they're doing here, they're making this faction a bit more

**[53:20]** fragile, a bit more interactive than the OG version which tends to kind of be an engine

**[53:26]** faction, tends to kind of like sit around and not do much and just win the game by just chilling.

**[53:34]** OG cats to me reminds me a little bit of, to use an analogy, the facehuggers in Aliens. It seems

**[53:39]** like the cats like to cling on to one player and the other players are like the crew of the

**[53:45]** Nostromo and they're just kind of like, that's really bad for you but we don't have the tools

**[53:51]** to do anything about it. If you're thinking something similar, definitely give the Newbastis

**[53:58]** tweaks a go. You can find this all on Tabletop Simulator. This is the default version of

**[54:04]** Boobastis that folks there play with. The default Boobastis spell books are also going to be

**[54:08]** available there. Just ask before you want to play the game, hey does everyone care if I play Vanilla

**[54:15]** Boobastis? Odds are people are not going to really mind unless you're like a cat specialist. They

**[54:20]** might not let you do that more than once. So I think this wraps up the Boobastis cat guide.

**[54:28]** Thank you so much for listening. At this point I hope you have a more full understanding of the

**[54:34]** cats. I do think this faction is a good addition to the game. I think it's exploring an interesting

**[54:40]** space that has been explored in another game like Root. Maybe it's just because I'm a little

**[54:46]** desensitized to the Vagabond by playing Root so much, but I think once you come to understand

**[54:52]** how much you need to pitch in to keep the cats down, you'll find it's not that unreasonable.

**[54:58]** As long as you're using your table talking, using your politics effectively, I think you're going

**[55:04]** to have an okay time fighting against the Vanilla variant of Boobastis or Noobastis. Pretty much you

**[55:10]** just need to recalibrate yourself when the cats are in the game. I think this is very similar

**[55:15]** honestly to Crawling Chaos being in the game in that the cats tend to warp the game around what

**[55:21]** they're doing. I don't think that's necessarily a problem. If you're able to just know that going in,

**[55:28]** adjust yourself accordingly, you're going to have a fine time. This cat faction is a lot of fun.

**[55:32]** It's beautiful to look at. I'm really, really looking forward to getting this one in person.

**[55:36]** It's going to be all gold and just look really gangster and awesome. That's another opening the

**[55:44]** way in the books. I really appreciate you for listening, so remember to rate, review, and

**[55:51]** subscribe. Join the Cthulhu Wars Discord and play some games with us on Tabletop Simulator. I'd love

**[55:58]** to run into you. I've also set up an email for this podcast finally. That's openingthewaypod

**[56:05]** at gmail.com. Please send me an email if you have questions, comments, ideas for an episode,

**[56:11]** you just want to chat with me. I'd be happy to hear from you and I'll be sure to write you back.

**[56:17]** Until then, take care of yourself. Pet your cats if you have them. I don't own any cats,

**[56:23]** but I guess I'll dedicate this episode to the three cats in my life, Minkus, Mambo, and Moira.

**[56:29]** Hope you three are doing well and eating a lot of smelly cat food. Until then,

**[56:36]** have a nice day, have a nice morning, have a nice evening, wherever it is that you are. Bye!

**[56:53]** you
