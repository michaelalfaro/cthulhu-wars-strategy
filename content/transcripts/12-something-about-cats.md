## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way. My name's Graham, and I'll be your host.

**[00:24]** I'm continuing along with the cat theme here, and in this episode we're going to cover the neutral

**[00:33]** expansion that came with Onslaught 4 called Something About Cats. This expansion is containing

**[00:41]** three different monsters, a new terror, and a new elder god, more cats from various parts of the

**[00:51]** galaxy, different planets. There might be some crossover with the PG game Hyperspace. I've not

**[00:58]** played, I'm not sure, so sorry if I missed one. Please let me know what it is. This episode's going to be

**[01:05]** slightly different than other neutral episodes I've done in that I've not actually played with

**[01:11]** any of these units, so it's going to be a little bit of me reacting to them in real time. I have a

**[01:16]** little bit of organized thoughts here, but I always appreciate all constructive feedback, so thank you

**[01:21]** for that. I got some good feedback on my Masks of Norlathotep expansion with some folks telling me

**[01:27]** I maybe wrote off specifically the Shadow Pharaoh. I heard from two different players saying like,

**[01:33]** hey, you're not giving the Shadow Pharaoh its justice, it's actually not that bad. So going forward,

**[01:40]** what I'm going to try to do in my evaluation of all these is not to roast them, more to just look for

**[01:49]** where are these going to be the most useful, even if it is kind of strange and unusual or maybe less

**[01:56]** common, just looking for where these are the most useful and can be the most effective.

**[02:03]** Without further ado, I'll get started and start going over the first of these. We've got a group of

**[02:08]** three neutral monsters here, so remember the rules for neutral monsters are only able to be purchased in

**[02:15]** the Doom phase. You can only purchase one loyalty card of a neutral monster per Doom phase, and it's going

**[02:22]** to cost you two Doom. Let's go over the first one here. I'm actually happy to say since the recording of

**[02:32]** the Ubastist episode, I've actually received my Onslaught 4 in person, so I'm holding these physically

**[02:40]** in my hand and that's pretty exciting. Let me start with the Cat from Mercury. You have two of them,

**[02:49]** they cost one to summon, and they have a combat of one. When you take the Cats from Mercury's loyalty card,

**[02:57]** you get a cat at your controlled Gate. Cat from Mercury, it actually reminds me a little bit of the Night Gaunt,

**[03:04]** like in the face. It's got the horns of a Night Gaunt, it's got a very craggy looking rock that it's perched on,

**[03:12]** and it's got like a, looks like a tail that's splitting into two, with claws on the end, it's gripping onto this

**[03:20]** rock rather tightly. Pretty spooky looking, kind of skeletal looking cat. Not one I would want to own in my

**[03:29]** home, of course. Their ability is a pre-battle needs affection. If a cat from Mercury is in a battle,

**[03:37]** you can choose one or more of your monsters present at that battle and immediately replace them with

**[03:43]** acolytes from your pool. Pretty odd ability. I'm struggling a little bit to come up with a useful

**[03:52]** way to apply this. One thing I can think of is Demon Sultan might really like this. They like getting

**[04:01]** their acolytes killed because then it lets them use Psychosis again. Let me know how you would use this

**[04:10]** one. This ability seems very tricky to me because mostly it seems like you are taking a bit of a loss,

**[04:17]** like most monsters cost more Power to summon than the one Power it costs to recruit an acolyte.

**[04:27]** Okay, okay, maybe, all right, all right, I figured out, I figured out one. You're in a battle, you're

**[04:31]** playing as Cthulhu now, okay? You have a Deep One and a cat from Mercury at your Gate. Somebody is coming

**[04:38]** over to fight you. You want your Deep Ones in your pool as Cthulhu so that you can use Devolve, so maybe

**[04:45]** you are swapping, you're revolving your Deep One back into an acolyte before the battle and that's

**[04:52]** going to let you use Devolve elsewhere on the map later because you put a Deep One back in your pool.

**[05:00]** Editing Graham here, I have slept on this and I think I have some more ideas on how to use the

**[05:06]** Mercury cat. I'm not sure how I missed this one, but Black Goat, once you have Thousand Young,

**[05:12]** your Ghouls cost zero Power. So if you had a Ghoul in the area with the Mercury cat, you could swap

**[05:22]** that Ghoul out for an acolyte and that would give you maybe a stall or two later to summon that Ghoul

**[05:28]** back for zero Power. And the other one that jumps out at me is Yellow Sign. Once you take Passion,

**[05:35]** I feel like you're probably going to be pretty down to if there's an undead, say, in the battle.

**[05:44]** With the Mercury cat, you swap out your undead for a single acolyte and then that first kill that

**[05:51]** happens in the battle, you apply to your acolyte just like you planned and get a little bit of a

**[05:55]** refund from Passion. That seems like a great use for this ability.

**[05:59]** Let's move on to the next neutral monster, which is Asteroid Cat. You've got two of them. When you

**[06:09]** pay your two doom to take this loyalty card, you get an Asteroid Cat at your controlled Gate.

**[06:14]** They cost one and they have a combat of one. This is by far my favorite sculpt from this neutral

**[06:21]** expansion. It's just very avant-garde. You can see the Asteroid. You've got what looks like three

**[06:29]** different Asteroid cats. They almost look like you took the paw of like a big lion or something and

**[06:34]** then combined it with the head of a house cat. They have like kind of finger teeth things and some

**[06:43]** tentacular arms that they're using to hold on to the asteroid with. It looks like they're moving

**[06:49]** through space quickly on that asteroid that's heading for Earth or wherever it is that you're playing.

**[06:54]** The ability for Asteroid Cats is Abandoned to Lusts. It's a zero-cost action. If an Asteroid Cat shares

**[07:03]** an area with a unit from another faction that has five or fewer Spellbooks, remove the cat from the

**[07:09]** map and place it on one of the enemy's empty Spellbook slots. When that enemy earns that Spellbook,

**[07:16]** return the Asteroid Cat to your controlled Gate. You get to choose immediately which of their

**[07:22]** available Spellbooks, they must take in that slot. This one is very funny. I like this one quite a bit.

**[07:28]** It's a very troll ability here. If you know your factions really well, you can really probably upset

**[07:37]** your friends and family and your playgroup. Just denying somebody a Spellbook that they really,

**[07:43]** really need. Like you somehow deny Yellow Sign the Screaming Dead they were planning on getting or

**[07:48]** Cthulhu, the submerge that they were planning on getting. There's just numerous examples. I can't

**[07:53]** think of what the worst ones are, but I could see this one being very, very annoying to deal with.

**[07:58]** It reminds me of the Moon Beast, which yeah, I will cover at some point. I've talked about it several

**[08:03]** times now. Kind of a hateful monster here. They're very cheap. You only have two of them. You'll only be

**[08:09]** blocking like maybe one or two players from their Spellbook and you know, only for a limited time

**[08:15]** because it doesn't prevent people from getting books the way Moon Beast do, but it just lets you

**[08:20]** choose. So just get creative about which books you want to give people. Maybe you can also use it as a

**[08:26]** bargaining chip like, hey, don't mess with me and I'll give you exactly the Spellbook that you were

**[08:32]** planning on getting. Very cool. I'll add this to the maybe list of the hateful game of Cthulhu Wars we're

**[08:38]** trying to put together with the most annoying neutrals. Moving on to our last monster and that

**[08:45]** is the Cat from Venus. You get two of them. When you pay 2 Doom for your loyalty card, you'll get a

**[08:52]** Cat from Venus at your controlled Gate. They cost one and they have a combat of one. This one is pretty

**[08:59]** nasty looking, kind of snake-like, dragon-like with a cat's face. Also with maybe like a little bit of a

**[09:07]** praying mantis thing going on with their arms. Very unpleasant. I feel like you could wear this

**[09:14]** one around your shoulders like a boa constrictor, but let's be honest, who would really want to do

**[09:19]** that? Sorry, if you own a snake. I don't hate snakes. I actually really like snakes. If you have a pet snake,

**[09:25]** feel free to share with me. I'd like to see it. The ability for Cat from Venus is Honeymoon,

**[09:30]** its ongoing ability. When a Cat from Venus captures a Cultist, gain one Power, and immediately return

**[09:37]** the Cultist to its owner's pool. This is a bit like the Cat from Mercury. I'm a little bit confused

**[09:46]** about how one would use this ability really effectively. Of course, the opponent on the

**[09:52]** receiving end here, they still need to spend the Power to re-recruit their accolades, so you didn't

**[09:57]** do nothing to them. You did cost them a Power still, but I feel like I'd be happy if somebody

**[10:03]** did this to me because I'd generally get to reposition an accolade. Maybe I need it at another

**[10:09]** Gate to kind of, I don't know, maybe I want to protect myself from dreams and I want to double up

**[10:14]** and put the accolade somewhere else later. As long as you're not moving your Cat from Venus around,

**[10:21]** you're actually breaking even on these captures. If you did stumble on a Gate that has, you know,

**[10:26]** two or three Cultists there, there's nothing stopping you from capturing all of them, so I guess

**[10:31]** in that sense it will help you quickly clean out a Gate from somebody that doesn't have any Power

**[10:37]** themselves to defend. You can capture all their accolades, get them out of the way, recruit one of

**[10:42]** yours back. Since you're breaking even on these captures too, you can also consider this like a form

**[10:50]** of stalls. If you do find those accolades to capture, you're essentially taking a zero cost action and

**[10:56]** you're going to be able to stall out the other players with your kitty. And then maybe the other

**[11:02]** side of the coin is you can use this politically to like quote unquote do someone a favor by capturing

**[11:09]** them and letting them reposition their accolades somewhere else, their Cultists somewhere else on the

**[11:15]** map. Very odd, have to see this one in action here. That's our last monster, so we'll move on to the

**[11:23]** Terror from this expansion and that is the Cat from Neptune. Terror's quick refresher, pretty similar to

**[11:30]** monsters. The way that you get the Terror is also in the Doom phase. Same thing, you can't also get a

**[11:36]** monster, you can only take one of these at a time. Pay two Doom and two Power to get this loyalty card

**[11:42]** and you'll get the Cat from Neptune at your controlled Gate. The Neptune Cat has a cost of three and a

**[11:48]** combat of three. Pretty cool looking sculpt on this one. It's like crouching down like it's about to

**[11:54]** strike. It's got like a mane of tentacles and a kind of split mouth. It's giving me like Demogorgon

**[12:03]** from Stranger Things vibes. It's got the extra set of limbs the way that I think the Mars Cat does from

**[12:10]** Lubastus, so it's got some muscles too. It's fucking ripped, like it looks like it will mess you up.

**[12:16]** Yeah, it's got a nice cost to combat ratio, like the same rate as a Starspawn, so it's pretty decent

**[12:23]** combat dice for the cost, honestly. The ability for Cat from Neptune is the final ritual. It's a post-battle.

**[12:32]** If the Cat from Neptune is killed in a battle, you may immediately perform a Ritual of Annihilation.

**[12:38]** If this causes the Ritual Marker to move to instant death, the game ends after this action.

**[12:43]** So this is a pretty spicy ability. I think it's going to take some planning to, you know, engineer

**[12:51]** the situation in which this is good, but I'm imagining like you had a really good turn and

**[12:57]** maybe you're on four Gates and you're like around 20 doom. Maybe you have a great old one or two in

**[13:02]** play. If you can manage to kill this and pay for a ritual, you might just be able to like burst up like

**[13:08]** five or six doom in one go and get a lot closer to winning or outright win the game in the action

**[13:15]** phase, which is always a little bit anticlimactic, but could be very climactic if everybody's aware of

**[13:22]** this ability and knows that they need to maybe like run away from conflicts with the Cat from Neptune.

**[13:28]** Kind of reminds me a little bit of the Fulmination ability from the Chocho, albeit like much less

**[13:34]** effective way of gaining doom. More on that in the Chocho guide. I really like this one. Seems like

**[13:41]** any faction could like this. Obviously don't try to get this killed if you're not on a lot of Gates

**[13:47]** because you want to just maximize that ritual. Could be rough if you're in a game with the wrong

**[13:53]** faction composition and rituals are already really expensive. Like do we really want to kill our cat

**[14:01]** and then pay like eight Power for a ritual? I wouldn't unless that like wins me the game on the

**[14:07]** spot, but I'll leave it up to you. Definitely curious if anybody has any cool Cat from Neptune

**[14:13]** stories, whether you won the game with it or you were on the receiving end of it and you didn't win

**[14:20]** the game. I'd like to know what happened. I think that'd be interesting. So let me know.

**[14:23]** And we'll now move on to the final unit in Something for Cats and this is our Elder God. It's Hagarg

**[14:33]** Rhiones, the cat from Jupiter. So I couldn't resist googling this one. I wanted to know what it was from.

**[14:41]** I've not read this story. Apparently this is in The Wizards of Hyperborea by John Foltz.

**[14:47]** This cat's also known as the liar in wait. Not a liar. Like he's lying down in wait. He's not

**[14:53]** waiting and lying to you while he's waiting. If that makes sense.

**[15:00]** It's got a fat like Jabba the Hutt tail on it. Got a pretty normal looking cat ears and eyes,

**[15:07]** but that's where it stops. It's got a big nasty gaping mouth thing and oof. It kind of reminds me of,

**[15:16]** I don't know if you've ever seen Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. It reminds me of the

**[15:21]** gluttony homunculus that just has a nasty endless hole to nowhere mouth. I showed this one to both my

**[15:29]** cat owning friends who play Cthulhu Wars with me. They were both grossed out,

**[15:34]** so I think they could consider this sculpt a great success.

**[15:39]** Quick refresher on Elder Gods. Basically they're great old ones. They have a different name.

**[15:43]** They don't roll combat dice, so they can't declare a battle, but they have some benefits in combat.

**[15:50]** Let's go over how to awaken Haggar Griones. Cost 4. You're going to need to have a controlled Gate

**[15:56]** in an area with your great old one, and you're going to need to pay 4 Power, and you'll place

**[16:01]** Haggar Griones at the Gate. Haggar cannot declare battle, but for combat, she adds 3 pains to your

**[16:10]** combat total. The ability for Haggar Griones is Subversion. It's the first player phase. It's unusual.

**[16:17]** Choose a player. If that player performs a Ritual of Annihilation in the doom phase,

**[16:22]** you steal one of the Elder Signs they earn, if any. Cool ability. I like this one a lot against

**[16:29]** any faction that likes to ritual. Chose, Ancient, Demon, Sultan, Yellow Sign, any of these ones,

**[16:37]** Windwalker, any of these things, especially factions that have multiple great old ones,

**[16:41]** they tend to want a ritual at least a couple times during a game, and you can get a slice of that

**[16:46]** cake by having Haggar Griones in play. I think that's a great place to be. So this is an Elder God.

**[16:52]** It also has a Spellbook that you can earn like other independent great old ones. The requirement for this

**[16:57]** one is very easy. It's just you have zero Power. That's guaranteed to happen. I think you'll earn this

**[17:04]** even if you choose to stop taking actions. I believe your Power still drops to zero and you would earn this book.

**[17:10]** The Spellbook that works with Haggar Griones is Laziness. It's a zero cost action. Any faction with exactly one Power

**[17:18]** left loses that Power. Alternatively, pay one Power to force Windwalker to also lose one Power. You can only use this action

**[17:27]** if Windwalker uses hibernate and or one or more enemy factions have exactly one Power.

**[17:35]** Editing Grim here again. Recording Grim's reaction was just totally wrong here, so I'm doing another one.

**[17:41]** I totally missed that this was a zero cost action. Make sure you read your abilities. Anytime you see zero cost,

**[17:46]** you should definitely pay attention. In addition to the obvious, if you go in the right order in the turn

**[17:53]** sequence and people have one Power and they're taking their action after you, they have one less

**[17:59]** because you have laziness. You just make them lose it. So just generally this is good. It's great against

**[18:04]** any factions that are trying to wait and do something when they have one or less Power. Maybe like a

**[18:09]** thousand forms when you're on one Power, Demon Sultan trying to stall with psychosis, or use undirected energy.

**[18:17]** Haggar Griones is going to shut all that stuff down. And just generally like lazing around for zero cost,

**[18:23]** you're doing a stall yourself while you are going to deprive the other players of Power.

**[18:28]** Somebody's going to go before you maybe and you won't be able to laziness every single person, but

**[18:33]** just getting to do it once or twice around is probably good enough and anything else on top of that is just gravy.

**[18:39]** I also missed that it's just a sick, sick little kitty that hates on Windwalker. If Windwalker hibernates,

**[18:47]** this cat will just slowly drain the Power from Windwalker and all the while you're just sitting there doing nothing, which sounds amazing.

**[18:55]** 10 out of 10. Love this one. Definitely want to get this one in a game. It seems awesome.

**[19:00]** 10 out of 10. I think that does it for the something for cats neutral expansion. I like this one a lot.

**[19:10]** I think the cats are cool. It seems like this took more inspiration from the Dreamquest Unknown Kadath,

**[19:17]** of which there's cats from many different planets kind of all in a, I don't know what you call it,

**[19:22]** like a cat, cat united nations or something like that. Lots of cats getting together, talking amongst themselves.

**[19:28]** A lot of these abilities are pretty strange. You heard me kind of stumbling to come up with good

**[19:35]** ideas on how to use them, but I was trying to stay objective. I'm not hating on any of these.

**[19:40]** They're a bit odd. I hope to get them on the table myself in real life soon, and maybe I'll have some

**[19:46]** more stories I can pass on. Until I do, I'd love to hear from you, like what's the best way to use any

**[19:52]** of these, especially the abilities. I'd love to know what you would do.

**[19:56]** I think that's all I have for this episode, so thank you so much for listening. I really,

**[20:01]** really appreciate everyone who has been listening to this podcast so far. I think at this point,

**[20:07]** if my metrics on Podbean are to be believed, my most listened to episode has about 170 different

**[20:15]** people have downloaded it, which is amazing. I honestly never thought this podcast would get

**[20:21]** more than like, I don't know, 20 or 30 people listening to one episode, so I'm very humbled and

**[20:27]** flattered that this many people find this useful. So thank you so much. One other thing I'll say,

**[20:35]** by the time this gets to you and you're listening to it, it's probably been around five or six weeks

**[20:40]** since my last episode. I do like releasing them like this, pairing the thematic content together,

**[20:47]** maybe pairing the old content with the new. I like how that's going, I like giving people maybe a full

**[20:55]** length episode and something like this that's more of a mini episode, but it takes time and I'm doing all

**[21:01]** this myself and I'm trying not to get burnt out. I have a tendency to get really excited about doing

**[21:08]** a thing and do it until I'm really burning the candle at both ends. And anyway, after I recorded

**[21:15]** the boobassest episode, I took like three weeks off, I didn't do any recording, I didn't do any editing,

**[21:20]** so that's the reason for the delay. Trust me, I'm super excited about doing this still. I'm just going to

**[21:27]** pace myself because I'm running a marathon and not a sprint, so if I don't release an episode exactly

**[21:33]** monthly or exactly within three to five weeks, it's probably I'm just taking some time for myself.

**[21:40]** My professional life's had some changes, I'm not going to tell you what I do for a living, but I

**[21:44]** had some recent changes for the better in that realm, and so I've been a lot more busy lately and

**[21:51]** I'm also, my wife and I are looking for a house, so yeah, life's been busy. Thanks for your

**[21:57]** patience and thanks again for listening. It's so cool to me that something I'm doing is actually

**[22:04]** getting this many people to listen to it. That's an episode in the books. Remember to rate, review,

**[22:11]** and subscribe. Join the Cthulhu Wars Discord where you can play games with myself and others on Tabletop

**[22:17]** Simulator. Feel free to send me an email if you like at openingthewaypod at gmail.com, I'd love to hear

**[22:25]** from you, or if you just want to chat with me, you can send me a message on Discord at killagram.

**[22:30]** And I think that's it. I might even look into setting up an Instagram to post announcements for

**[22:36]** when my updates are happening, but we'll see if I feel motivated enough to do that.

**[22:41]** Until next time, have a nice day, have a nice evening,

**[22:44]** a nice morning, or wherever it is that you are. Thanks. Bye.
