## Transcript

**[00:00]** Young had written often of certain things he had learned from reading in various antique volumes.

**[00:07]** He wrote of a forgotten cycle of superstitious lore, which would have been better unknown.

**[00:13]** He mentioned strange and alien names, and toward the last of his letters, which had ceased to come

**[00:17]** weeks before, he had hinted of actual worship of trans-spatial beings still practiced in such

**[00:23]** towns as Camside, Burchester, Sevenford, Goatswood, and Temphill. In his very last letter, he had

**[00:31]** written of a temple to Yogg-Satoth, which existed coterminously with an actual church in Temphill,

**[00:37]** where monstrous rituals had been performed. This eldritch temple had been, it was thought,

**[00:43]** the origin of the town's name, a corruption of the original Temple Hill, which had been built around

**[00:49]** the Hillset Church, where Gates, if opened by no long-forgotten alien incantations, would gape to

**[00:56]** let elder demons pass from other spheres. There was a particularly hideous legend, he wrote,

**[01:03]** concerning the errand on which these demons came, but he forbore to recount this,

**[01:07]** at least until he had visited the alien temple's earthly location.

**[01:19]** Hello, and welcome to another episode of Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[01:34]** My name's Graham, and I'll be your host. Hope you're doing well. Happy Halloween, if you're hearing this.

**[01:42]** Hopefully I'm publishing this episode on Halloween. It's my favorite holiday. I love spooky season.

**[01:48]** I'm already getting into spooky season, and it's not even the end of September at time of recording.

**[01:57]** Hopefully I'm spending the end of October not editing podcast episodes, and instead

**[02:02]** watching scary movies and doing other fun things like carving pumpkins. That's one of my all-time

**[02:08]** favorite things to do. And you can multitask a little bit. You can carve pumpkins while you watch scary

**[02:13]** movies. Quick aside on scary movies since we're talking about them.

**[02:17]** What are some of the better cosmic horror movies out there, like Lovecraftian movies out there?

**[02:25]** I made a habit, a mission of watching as many as I could during COVID lockdown when I was really

**[02:31]** doom-spiraling. I was waking up every day and watching a scary movie. Every day, at least.

**[02:37]** So I watched a lot of them. The level of quality varies greatly.

**[02:42]** There's a bunch of movies that are adaptations of Lovecraft stories. If you really like those stories,

**[02:49]** I think you'll like those movies, but those are not the ones I'm going to be talking about.

**[02:53]** One I would say is kind of obvious. Probably the best cosmic horror movie everyone's probably seen

**[02:58]** is John Carpenter's The Thing. I think that's the undisputed champ. I wouldn't put anything

**[03:04]** particularly close to it. One other movie I would shout out would be, if you haven't seen it, that

**[03:12]** Thing movie is part of like an unofficial apocalypse trilogy of movies that John Carpenter made.

**[03:18]** One of the two other ones, In the Mouth of Madness, highly, highly underrated. Very good. Very scary.

**[03:26]** I think it's maybe the perfect cosmic horror. It's like even more cosmic horror than The Thing is.

**[03:33]** Maybe it's just not as good of a movie as The Thing, but I think it really gets the theme across.

**[03:40]** Other good scary movies I could recommend I've seen recently? Attack the Block. Highly recommend that

**[03:45]** one. It's got a pre-Star Wars John Boyega in it as the main character. Just some London youths having

**[03:54]** to contend with some aliens that have landed. Kind of a cheesy plot, but a really, really fun movie.

**[04:01]** It's like a little bit spooky. If you like Stranger Things or if you like the alien franchise with

**[04:08]** Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver, I guarantee you, you will love Attack the Block.

**[04:16]** So enough with the movie talk. I will get into today's main topic.

**[04:19]** Happy to bring you another faction guide on an off month where I don't normally do them,

**[04:25]** this time on Opener of the Way. Read a little bit of the story The Church in the High Street by

**[04:33]** Ramsey Campbell there in the intro, in case you were wondering. This is not my favorite faction per

**[04:40]** se, but Yogg-Sothoth is definitely my favorite great old one, and therefore, even though I am not the

**[04:46]** best opener player in the world, I very much aspire to be, because I think this faction is very, very cool.

**[04:54]** If you don't know that much about Yogg-Sothoth, Yoggster, it's basically the great old one that

**[05:00]** represents kind of like the infinite knowledge. It's supposed to be coterminous with space and time,

**[05:07]** and because of that, this faction has a lot of abilities that sort of reward you for improvising and

**[05:13]** kind of doing the right thing in the right moment. I don't recommend this one for newer players. I feel

**[05:22]** this is one of the more big brain factions in the game, and by that I mean you kind of have like the

**[05:28]** highest highs if you're playing it really well and the lowest lows if you are making mistakes,

**[05:33]** and you will crash and burn really hard with this faction more than once, I promise, in your journey to

**[05:38]** be a great opener player. This faction really rewards you for being creative. It's not the best at doing

**[05:47]** anything, but it can do a lot of different things. This one's also a bit strange, a bit of a jack of all

**[05:53]** trades. I've talked before about how I think there's sort of a spectrum of Cthulhu Wars factions, and some

**[06:00]** fall along the more fighty side of the spectrum, others fall along the more doom-loving side of the

**[06:07]** spectrum. I really think opener has a little bit of representation of both of those ends. I would

**[06:12]** plot it right in the middle honestly, because it can just do so many different things. You are inclined

**[06:17]** to fight for reasons I will explain later related to your million-favored ones Spellbook, but on the

**[06:23]** other hand you also have a crazy potential to score a ton of doom all at once, once per game,

**[06:29]** during the doom phase with your dragon descending Spellbook. Using that properly, you can close out

**[06:36]** the game surprisingly fast. The signature Spellbook of this faction, in my opinion, is million-favored

**[06:44]** ones, which is very very cool. I'll talk a lot more about it. It allows your units to mutate and grow

**[06:50]** and change after the battle. I think this is a really great flavor-win callback to the HP Lovecraft story

**[06:58]** Dunwich Horror, at least I think it is, where Junior Waitley is growing up in the barn along with the

**[07:04]** decayed Waitley branch who lives in Dunwich, and I would always consider my opener acolytes to be

**[07:11]** of that branch of Waitleys. I don't have too much else to say on my opening thoughts, so we can go ahead and

**[07:19]** get into the guide proper. Starting with the setup for opener, this faction has the most variable setup

**[07:27]** of any faction in the game. After all players have setup, you start with 8 Power, 6 acolytes,

**[07:32]** and a controlled Gate in an empty area of your choice. We've covered a few factions now with

**[07:39]** variable setup locations. Usually there's some sort of restriction on it, like ancients only being able

**[07:45]** to do it in certain areas with glyphs. Chocho can only do it where there's a starting glyph. Opener can

**[07:52]** do it literally wherever they want, similar to Demon Sultan. With that in mind, choosing where you can

**[08:00]** start, it can feel a little overwhelming, but my advice would be, as with Demon Sultan, as with some

**[08:06]** of these other factions, consider the faction mix at the table. Are there going to be players that are

**[08:12]** coming for you right away? Are people going to be kind of sitting in the corner doing their own thing?

**[08:17]** Take that into account. Also consider what you're going to be doing early on in Action Phase 1 as you

**[08:24]** consider where you're going to set up. Without getting too much into the opening

**[08:30]** strategies right away, you've got some really aggressive options with this faction. You've also

**[08:35]** got some really passive options. So think about which one of those you're going to go for. Think

**[08:40]** about what some of the other factions at the table are capable of and might be interested in doing

**[08:44]** themselves, and act accordingly. That's kind of the best advice I can give, but again I will repeat

**[08:51]** myself over and over here. Improvising is the best thing that you can be doing with this faction, so

**[08:57]** be flexible so that you can react appropriately and do the right thing in the right moment.

**[09:05]** Moving on to the unique faction ability for Opener that is Beyond 1. It's a 1 cost action. Select one

**[09:13]** of your units with a cost of 3 or more in an area that contains a Gate and no enemy great old ones.

**[09:19]** Move that unit, the Gate, and any controlling unit to any area on the map that does not already have a Gate.

**[09:27]** This is a very cool ability. It's very flexible. You can move anywhere on the map and you get to leave

**[09:33]** the enemy monsters that might be at the Gate that you were at behind and bring only the acolyte with

**[09:39]** you, which you're probably planning on capturing. That's really really nice. Notably this does not

**[09:45]** work if there's a great old one in the area, so be very aware of that when you're choosing which Gates you

**[09:50]** want to go after. As to where you might want to move the Gate, ideally you're going to move it into an

**[09:57]** area where you may already have acolytes or adjacent to some of your other areas. Set up an easy capture

**[10:04]** and move on to the Gate and take it for yourself. The general play pattern for Beyond 1 is rough for

**[10:12]** your opponents. You move to one of their Gates, maybe there's a monster there, maybe there's not. They have a

**[10:17]** choice. They can either battle you if there's a monster there. That might work out for them and

**[10:22]** pain you away. Great. If they don't have a monster, you're probably going to yank their Gate away and

**[10:28]** they can either let you do that or they can summon a monster, which is a mistake because the monster is

**[10:33]** going to get left behind when you're beyond one. So if you're playing against opener, don't recommend

**[10:38]** that you do this. Some other spicier options, you could always move that Gate into an area with other

**[10:47]** enemy units. Make them be the ones to do the capturing. If they do and they don't have a great

**[10:52]** old one there, you can obviously just move the Gate again after they do the capturing for you.

**[10:57]** And they're sad too, they kind of wasted their Power. Another nice thing about Beyond 1, even just

**[11:04]** threatening Beyond 1 is going to get you closer to one of your Spellbook requirements, which is

**[11:10]** having units at two enemy Gates.

**[11:16]** Editing Grim here to shout out a couple of mean things that you can do with Beyond 1 as well.

**[11:21]** There's a number of requirements or Spellbook requirements that have to do with having a Gate

**[11:27]** in a certain area. You can really punish those with Beyond 1. One good example would be

**[11:34]** that South Pacific Gate that's required to awaken Cthulhu. If you beyond 1 that Gate away for some

**[11:40]** reason and there's no Gate in South Pacific, Cthulhu cannot reawaken until another Gate is built.

**[11:47]** Some other examples might be the Chocho Spellbook requirement, remove your starting Gate, or the

**[11:55]** Windwalker requirement to awaken Ithaca of removing that Gate from the pole.

**[11:59]** Both those are kind of rare, but it would be pretty funny if you were able to do either one of those.

**[12:07]** Another thing on Beyond 1, I don't typically write these episodes with any kind of alternate maps in

**[12:14]** mind, but Beyond 1 is extremely potent on a lot of the other maps, and that's because there's a lot of

**[12:19]** other mechanics that have to do with having Gates in certain areas. So some examples, the citadel areas

**[12:26]** in Dreamlands, the tome areas in the library, getting into the laboratory for surgery, or moving Gates to and

**[12:34]** from the green pyramid on Yagoth. You can even rescue Gates that have been glaciers from primeval and

**[12:41]** move them into other areas that haven't been frozen over. All those are really nice.

**[12:47]** If that didn't mean anything to you because you haven't played on these maps, that's fine.

**[12:50]** Listen to some of my other episodes, I am planning to get to all of the maps.

**[12:54]** Last thing on Beyond 1, it can be very tempting to get addicted to using this ability and just use it

**[13:03]** to steal people's Gates all day long. It's really easy to do that with this ability. Just know it kind

**[13:09]** of runs counter to two of your Spellbook requirements, which I'll get into very shortly, around having a

**[13:15]** certain amount of Gates on the map. You do want Gates to be built as this faction. You can steal a bunch

**[13:22]** of Gates with Beyond 1, that's great. Maybe you will build up a nice surplus of Power, but there needs

**[13:28]** to be a certain number of Gates on the map at the end of the game, and if there's not, you will have

**[13:33]** lost because you will not have gotten all of your Spellbooks. That being said, I will transition right

**[13:41]** into the Spellbook requirements, starting with the two that I was just mentioning. First one, 8 Gates exist

**[13:47]** on the map. The second one is 12 Gates exist on the map. In a 2-3 player game, for that Spellbook requirement,

**[13:54]** only 10 Gates need to be on the map. First one, 8 Gates on the map. Depending on the player count,

**[14:01]** this should happen pretty naturally, though not always. In a 4 player game in Action Phase 1, if all

**[14:09]** players have built a second Gate for themselves, which is pretty typical, you end up getting this Spellbook

**[14:16]** basically free. The 8 Gate book is not particularly hard to earn, though it can be challenging in

**[14:24]** 3 player games, or I've not even played a 2 player game with Opener, so I'm not going to comment on 2

**[14:30]** player games. The second of these requirements, 12 Gates exist on the map, is a lot more of a concern.

**[14:38]** I would go as far as to say, like, you need to have this one at top of mind at all times when playing

**[14:43]** Opener. Most Opener games I see where the Opener player doesn't not get all their books, it's this

**[14:48]** one that they haven't earned. I've seen many, many, many games. I've played many games myself where I

**[14:55]** feel like I'm doing really awesome as the Opener, but the end of the game comes around and there's

**[14:59]** only 10 Gates on the map and not 12, and it's a 4 player game, and you're screwed because you need to

**[15:05]** spend your Power doing other stuff later, and you don't have those Gates on the map. 3 player and

**[15:11]** under games you only need to have 10 Gates on the map. That might be difficult too. I'm not an

**[15:15]** expert on 3 player, I've played plenty of 3 player games, but a little bit of a different beast.

**[15:21]** I typically write these guides with 4 plus player games in mind, so I'm going to continue with this

**[15:26]** guide under that assumption. 12 Gates, arguably your most difficult Spellbook to earn depending on the

**[15:33]** player count and the texture of the game. Some games are resource rich, you'll find players building

**[15:39]** Gates without you needing to talk them into it, that's perfect for you. If that's true, you'll

**[15:45]** earn this Spellbook by barely even trying. But you need to be very aware and careful, always keeping

**[15:52]** this one in mind in a game where the resources are more scarce. I've played plenty of games where the

**[15:57]** players are just not inclined to build Gates right from the get-go, and if you're in that game as

**[16:02]** opener, you really need to have that awareness and plan accordingly. In a higher player game, like a 6

**[16:09]** to 8 player game, I'm not sweating either of these Spellbook requirements, it's going to happen

**[16:14]** really naturally. In a 6 player game, that 8 Gates book is going to happen right away, and 12 Gates

**[16:21]** might happen really really shortly afterward. Last thing on the 12 Gates requirement, I think this one's

**[16:29]** become even more difficult with some of the newer factions that have come to the game, cats and demon

**[16:35]** sultan. Cats don't ever build Gates, though the moon itself counts as a Gate, and although demon sultan

**[16:42]** does like to build Gates, it can also destroy them with its animate matter ability, and that can really

**[16:48]** really hurt you as the opener player. So if you're playing in a game with demon sultan, I would try to

**[16:53]** befriend them if at all possible, and at least talk them out of using animate matter on your Gates,

**[17:00]** if not altogether. At least get to your 12 Gates and then let them animate matter all that they want

**[17:05]** after you've earned your Spellbook. Next Spellbook requirement, lose one of your own units in battle.

**[17:14]** I think this one's pretty easy to earn, battles are happening all the time in Cthulhu Wars,

**[17:19]** especially nice if you're not the one who paid the Power to declare the battle.

**[17:24]** Ideally you're losing a cheap unit like a mutant or maybe an acolyte to earn this Spellbook.

**[17:30]** You may even want to declare a battle that's not advantageous for you, just because you have a

**[17:36]** really cool Spellbook, million favored ones, you might just lose a unit and also upgrade a bunch

**[17:41]** of units. I'll talk a lot more about million favored ones shortly. So yeah, this is one of your

**[17:46]** easier Spellbooks to earn. Don't force it, it will happen naturally over the course of the game.

**[17:53]** Next Spellbook you have units at at least two areas containing enemy controlled Gates. I think

**[17:59]** this one can also happen pretty organically, especially depending on the kind of opening

**[18:04]** that you're going for. Like I mentioned at the top of the episode, this faction can have some very

**[18:09]** aggressive openings. Another thing that makes this one a bit easier to earn, you have a Spellbook

**[18:15]** they break through, which I'll talk more about, that allows you to summon monsters at enemy Gates

**[18:19]** without having to move them there. That one's really nice in combination trying to earn the

**[18:23]** Spellbook requirement. If you're going to be using beyond one a lot, you're going to be at an enemy

**[18:29]** Gate at least with one of your units, so take advantage of that. Maybe you can move to a second

**[18:34]** Gate before you beyond one and get the Spellbook requirement out of the way. This is a great Spellbook

**[18:41]** to take early on if you're planning on being aggressive. You can earn a Spellbook right away

**[18:46]** getting into those enemy Gated areas. I usually take million favored ones and start going to work

**[18:51]** growing your army and upgrading your units, which I'll talk a lot more about.

**[18:58]** Next Spellbook your great old one is in the same area with an enemy great old one.

**[19:03]** Another one I think is fairly straightforward. If you're the threat at the table, you're not even going

**[19:09]** to work hard for this one because people are going to come after your great old one.

**[19:13]** I would just be careful when you earn this one. Great if you can earn this as one of your last books

**[19:18]** and get unlimited combat as Yogg-Sothoth is one of your better combat units, but you don't want to get

**[19:24]** killed unnecessarily like all great old ones, but especially yours because it will provide you some

**[19:29]** Power and the longer it stays alive. Last Spellbook requirement, awaken Yogg-Sothoth.

**[19:36]** Obviously you're going to do this in order to win the game, so no comment there.

**[19:41]** The awakening requirements for your great old one, you're going to need to replace your most expensive

**[19:46]** monster, which is spawn of Yogg-Sothoth, in order to awaken. So make sure you have one and don't leave

**[19:53]** your great old one isolated once you've brought it out because it will be more helpful the longer that

**[19:59]** it exists on the map.

**[20:00]** Those are the Spellbook requirements out of the way, so I'll move into the units for open over the way.

**[20:10]** Starting with the acolytes. Unique acolytes are pretty cool looking. It's just a lady with a,

**[20:16]** looks like a, maybe a meat cleaver. Coming in for the chop, get to the chopper. This one looks really cool.

**[20:22]** I've also gotten the final, final Cthulhu Wars rulebook, and I've found in the credits the people

**[20:29]** that have actually made all the sculpts in Cthulhu Wars. So, apologies to all the sculptors that I have

**[20:34]** not acknowledged in previous episodes. I'm going to do that going forward because you deserve credit

**[20:39]** where credit is due. All the sculpts in this game are very, very cool. So, Robert Goldkne created the

**[20:46]** opener acolyte. Very, very cool looking. Not too much to say on the opener acolytes. Again,

**[20:54]** I'm going to just repeat myself a whole bunch of times. Million favored ones, your Spellbook,

**[20:58]** your acolytes can upgrade into monsters via million favored ones. It can be really nice to upgrade your

**[21:06]** acolytes into monsters. Why do I say that? You're taking your acolytes off the board, yes, and you'll need

**[21:12]** to recruit them back later. But honestly, one of the safest places for your acolytes is in your pool.

**[21:17]** Nobody can touch them there. That's really, really nice and also provides you with a nice one-cost action.

**[21:24]** You can also avoid having to move your acolytes this way. Million favored ones is really good. I'll

**[21:29]** talk more about it soon. Next, we have the mutant, which is sculpted by Stephen May. Good job,

**[21:39]** Stephen. This one looks really awesome. It looks exactly like a Cultist that has already started to

**[21:47]** turn and become something that's not so human anymore. It looks like it's got hooves for feet now.

**[21:53]** Something's starting to grow out of the back. I can just see the human features melting away.

**[21:59]** Tentacles coming out of the chest. Looking like one arm's been lost and the other one's still there.

**[22:04]** They look like they're in a little bit of pain as well, but very, very cool. Very creepy. Gives me

**[22:10]** great Dunwich Horror vibes, so excellent job. You've got four of them in the pool. They cost two to summon,

**[22:18]** and they have one combat. As a unit, these are kind of unimpressive. Two cost one combat, but they do

**[22:26]** hold down a Gate. That's their main purpose. And yeah, for million favored ones, they can upgrade.

**[22:32]** It's your cheapest monster that you can summon at enemy Gates, maybe, with they breakthrough, if you want to.

**[22:44]** Next unit we have is the Abomination, sculpted by Joe Brumbly. Great job. This one looks disgusting.

**[22:53]** It looks only vaguely like it could have been human before. All the opener monsters are very disgusting

**[23:02]** and cool. They all just sort of look like they are becoming less and less human over time. I imagine

**[23:08]** like an acolyte is just growing into a nasty thing. This one is just... it's still got those hooved

**[23:16]** feet. There's even more tentacles growing out of the chest area. It's got two arms. It looks like it's

**[23:23]** grown an extra set of arms as well. And the upper arms look like they're like taking off a shirt,

**[23:30]** taking off the skin of the belly and revealing all the tentacles. The human face is still there. It

**[23:36]** looks like it's just in agony, sort of like bubbling around and morphing and mutating. Really creepy looking.

**[23:44]** I love this one. You've got three Abominations in the pool. They cost three to summon and they have two

**[23:51]** combat. So sort of a decent rate. Three cost two combat. These are notably your cheapest units that can

**[23:59]** use beyond one. They're in the middle of the chain for a million favored ones. More on that later.

**[24:05]** And they also work with one of Opener's other Spellbooks, Dread Curse of Azathoth, which is sort

**[24:12]** of like a sky laser targeted strike in one area of the map I'll talk more about that gets more dice added

**[24:19]** to it the more Abominations and spawns of Yongzath you have on the map. Not too much else to say on

**[24:27]** Abominations. They're cheap depending on what kind of opening you're going for. You might be summoning

**[24:33]** one of these Action Phase 1. The next monster for Opener of the Way we've got the spawn of Yongzath.

**[24:44]** Looks like it's sculpted by Tim Prowl. Really cool. Really disgusting. Maybe they outdid the Abomination in

**[24:53]** terms of disgustingness, but maybe all these people had talked to each other to coordinate

**[24:58]** what these would look like, at least vaguely. Because this one just looks like the final form

**[25:03]** of the human that has undergone a mutation. This one just kind of looks more like an insect and alien.

**[25:12]** Only the face remains looking a little bit human and at this point it looks like it's more of a skull.

**[25:18]** Otherwise this just kind of looks like a nasty bug thing. It's got multiple arms that end in hooves.

**[25:26]** It's got some kind of claw looking things around the head. It's just got a nasty

**[25:33]** bulk now and lots of tentacles coming out the front. It's got quad butt technology on the back. I don't

**[25:40]** know what's going on back there. It's pretty gross looking. Oh yeah, wow. Great job on these Opener

**[25:47]** monsters. They are all like some of the most disgusting to look at I think in the entire game.

**[25:53]** Which I think is an achievement. That's a feature, not a bug.

**[25:57]** You've got two of these in your pool. They cost four Power to summon. That's very expensive and they

**[26:03]** have a combat of three. These are the top of the chain for million favored ones. These can downgrade

**[26:12]** using million favored ones into as many as four mutants. Depending on how many you have in the

**[26:17]** pool at the time after a battle with a spawn. There's another monster that counts towards the

**[26:24]** dread curse of Azthoth which we'll talk more about so keep that in mind too. And the last thing on the

**[26:29]** spawns, you need one of them in play to replace in order to awaken your great old one. Just be really

**[26:36]** careful where you have these out. They're very expensive. They're really the most expensive,

**[26:42]** one of the most expensive monsters in the game. So don't get these killed for no reason. Especially

**[26:47]** since they can grow into your great old one. It feels really bad to have a spawn ready to transform

**[26:54]** and then get it killed. It really sets you back as this faction because you want to get your great old

**[26:58]** one out sooner rather than later. Moving on to the last opener unit and your great old one. It is Yogg

**[27:08]** himself, the key and the Gate. Very very cool. Sculpted by one Mark Evans. Love this one. Just the ultimate

**[27:17]** disgusting great old one. Shout out to opener just for having the grossest units in the whole game.

**[27:22]** This one just looks like... I don't even know what it looks like. It doesn't look like anything I can relate

**[27:27]** to as a human. Just a big bulbous mass of... I don't know... bubbles? Tentacles? Are there eyes here?

**[27:35]** It doesn't even seem like there's eyes. It just looks like a big nasty mass and if you look closely

**[27:40]** you will see it's actually sitting on a Gate as well. It is the key in the Gate after all.

**[27:47]** Really disgusting. One of my favorite looking great old ones in the whole game.

**[27:51]** How to awaken Yogg's Toth. You must replace a spawn of Yogg that you have on the map. And secondly you'll

**[28:02]** have to pay 6 Power and you'll have to replace that spawn with Yogg. The combat for this great old one

**[28:09]** is equal to twice the number of enemy controlled faction great old ones in play. So depending on the

**[28:17]** faction composition you might have a really hard hitting Yogg or it might just be okay middle of

**[28:23]** the road not rolling that many dice. Think about a more classical Cthulhu Wars game. Maybe there's

**[28:30]** like Black Goat Cthulhu and Crawling Chaos. This great old one's only rolling six dice tops but

**[28:35]** in a high player count game, in a game with like Demon Sultan, Windwalker, Yellow Sign, this great old one

**[28:41]** could potentially be rolling higher than 10 dice easily. By far your most Powerful unit in terms of

**[28:49]** rolling dice. The ability for this great old one is the key in the Gate. It's ongoing. Yogg's Toth counts

**[28:57]** as a Gate for every purpose except for the beyond one ability. Yogg is not controlled by any Cultist and

**[29:04]** can exist in the same area as another Gate. Really really cool ability. Lots of implications here.

**[29:13]** Your great old one's a Gate so notably this is plus one Gates toward your Spellbook requirements. Really

**[29:19]** really nice. To make a comparison to the Dark Young with the red sign Spellbook, if you can keep this

**[29:27]** unit alive through multiple gather Power and doom phase steps it is definitely paying for itself. You're

**[29:33]** going to be passively earning Power and doom just by this existing. Keep this one alive. Do not throw

**[29:40]** this one under the bus if you can help it. Though I have seen situations come up where you may want to

**[29:47]** suicide your great old one because it's just rolling so many dice. I've rolled as many as 14,

**[29:53]** 16 dice with this before just by itself and that's pretty impressive.

**[29:57]** Moving on to opener Spellbooks. The first Spellbook is channel Power. It's a battle ability, not a pre-battle

**[30:07]** nor a post-battle. During the battle. After you roll battle dice you may pay one Power to re-roll all the

**[30:14]** dice which were not kills or pains. You may do this more than once. This one seems good on paper but

**[30:22]** remember what I said this faction is kind of a jack of all trades master of none. Opener doesn't

**[30:27]** typically roll a lot of combat dice especially outside of yog itself so this ability can be kind

**[30:34]** of suspect from time to time so do not overuse this one. Hopefully you're using it in a battle containing

**[30:40]** yog and hopefully an entourage so that you're adding to the dice total. I'm not really excited to use this

**[30:49]** on any less than like five or six blanks. Remember when you roll any combat die you have a 50% chance

**[30:57]** of rolling a blank so re-rolling three dice for example I don't really think is worth the Power.

**[31:03]** You might not get the results that you're looking for that way. Fire beware, do not overuse this one.

**[31:12]** I think I need to talk about this Spellbook now. A million favored ones. It's a post-battle. After

**[31:17]** pains and kills are resolved, promote any or all surviving acolytes to mutants, mutants to

**[31:23]** abominations, and abominations to spawns of Yogg-Satoth. You can promote a spawn by transforming

**[31:29]** it into as many mutants as are in your pool. So this might be my favorite Spellbook in all of Cthulhu Wars.

**[31:37]** It's really really cool as I said as I was describing the sculpts. They all look like they are

**[31:42]** transforming into each other which I think is so awesome. When you're playing opener, I think using

**[31:50]** this ability effectively is key to your victories. The general advice is I don't recommend using this

**[31:58]** one often in areas where you have only one unit. You're not really saving Power by doing this.

**[32:05]** Let me give you a quick example. You have a mutant in an area and you decide to battle with it and it

**[32:13]** survives the battle and it becomes an abomination. Cool. You spent two Power summoning the mutant and

**[32:19]** you spent one Power battling to promote it. That's three Power. That's exactly what you would have spent

**[32:24]** summoning an abomination, right? So the recommended use for million favored ones is really to have as

**[32:32]** many units as you can in the area including acolytes. Ideally you have sort of a chain of costs in

**[32:39]** there. So like an acolyte and a mutant and an abomination for example. Hard to give an example

**[32:46]** in an audio format of a good million favored ones but I'll do my best. Let's say we've got three

**[32:52]** acolytes, one mutant, and one abomination in an area, right? You battle, then all of your acolytes can become

**[32:58]** mutants. The mutant becomes an abomination and the abomination becomes a spawn. Let's assume we spent

**[33:06]** five Power, two to summon the mutant, and three to summon the abomination, right? So five Power plus one is

**[33:12]** six Power. Now let's imagine how much Power we spent to get that end result. We end up with three mutants,

**[33:21]** an abomination, and a spawn. Spawn costs four, abomination costs three, and the mutants each cost

**[33:29]** two. So six Power from the mutants, three Power from the abomination, that's nine, plus four from the

**[33:35]** spawn, that's thirteen. If we only spent five Power summoning and then battled and then promoted,

**[33:42]** we've only spent really six Power versus like thirteen Power that we would have spent summoning

**[33:48]** the monsters. Of course you're going to have to re-recruit the Cultists, but even if you've done

**[33:55]** that, you still have saved like three or four Power depending on how you count it, right?

**[34:01]** Sorry to give such a complicated example. Just know having more units in the area generally will

**[34:06]** quote-unquote save you Power. That's important.

**[34:11]** Yes, your acolytes, you'll need to re-recruit them once they become mutants, but like I said earlier,

**[34:17]** having acolytes in the pool is actually a safe place for them. And yeah, as I've said in this

**[34:22]** and other episodes, recruiting them is actually nice because you also won't have to move them

**[34:27]** into the right location. It's also a one-cost action to re-recruit and that's really really helpful

**[34:34]** to redeploy acolytes across the map and just take cheap actions over and over and over again.

**[34:41]** If you're ever in a position where you can like battle, promote an acolyte, and then recruit,

**[34:47]** you're just taking one-cost actions over and over again, spending your Power as slowly as possible,

**[34:52]** that's a good thing to be doing. Ideally, you're positioning your units in such a way where you can

**[34:58]** kind of like absorb losses a little bit here and there by upgrading and just hiding your acolytes

**[35:04]** from capture is another nice thing. Like if a great old one moves into my opener Gate and I have like

**[35:10]** a mutant and an acolyte there, I'm probably just going to battle them even if they're killing me.

**[35:15]** Maybe one of my units survives and I get to upgrade it, cool. I've also just kind of stopped them from

**[35:21]** capturing my acolyte, which I don't want them to do. Last thing on this Spellbook, it's possible to

**[35:28]** kind of like hide where you're going to awaken Yogg by doing these upgrades, so not really something I

**[35:35]** would do unless I'm feeling like I'm a really advanced opener player, but just something to mention here.

**[35:41]** If you have multiple spawns, people aren't going to know where you're going to awaken necessarily.

**[35:46]** Hiding that from people can be pretty useful from time to time depending on the faction composition.

**[35:54]** Moving on to another Spellbook, we've got the Dread Curse of Azathoth.

**[35:58]** It's a 2 cost action. Select an area, any area. Roll 1 battle die per abomination and spawn of

**[36:04]** Yogg-Satoth in play. Apply the results as kills and pains to enemy factions in the area. You choose

**[36:11]** which faction receives the results, but they choose which of their units receives each result. No battle

**[36:17]** type abilities apply. You choose to which area each unit is pained, ignoring normal pain rules.

**[36:23]** This ability is really really cool. It's like a drone strike, sky lasers, I like to call it sky lasers.

**[36:32]** If you can catch great old ones slipping by themselves, this is a great way to just assassinate

**[36:36]** them for 2 Power and not put yourself at risk at all. Newer players, if you're not used to playing

**[36:43]** against opener, watch out for this. If you're an experienced player, you should probably know better

**[36:49]** and not put your great old one at risk. But yeah, it feels really good to snipe like

**[36:54]** Narlathotep with this ability when you can catch them out of position.

**[36:59]** You could roll anywhere between 0 and 5 dice with this ability depending on your monster count. I don't

**[37:06]** typically use this for any fewer than 4 dice. Again, the risk of blanking out is too great for me

**[37:13]** on anywhere between 1 and 3 dice. So typically I only use this on 5 dice, maybe on 4 dice if I have a good

**[37:20]** reason to. This is another ability, don't get addicted to using this. It is expensive. 2 Power is not that cheap.

**[37:29]** Paying 6 or 8 Power to use this 3 or 4 times is kind of suspect unless you're actually killing things

**[37:35]** each time you're doing that. Another thing to call out, don't underestimate the pains rolled here.

**[37:42]** You get to choose where the units are pained even if madness is in the game. This is not a battle,

**[37:47]** so you get to choose wherever you want things to go. You can move an enemy great old one into

**[37:53]** like a nearby meat grinder controlled by someone else who's going to go before that player. That's a nice

**[37:58]** way to like effectively kill a great old one without rolling a kill using this Spellbook.

**[38:02]** Typically you use this to snipe great old ones, but sometimes you might need to just brush a few

**[38:08]** units off a Gate to stop someone from winning or to climb a Gate for yourself. This is a really useful

**[38:13]** Spellbook to be able to do that remotely and not spend Power moving units into the area unless absolutely

**[38:19]** necessary. Moving on to another Spellbook, we've got Dragon Ascending. Once only, once during the game,

**[38:28]** at any time you can set your Power to be equal to the current Power of one chosen enemy faction.

**[38:34]** Flip this Spellbook face down after use to indicate you cannot use it again.

**[38:41]** This is a very magical Spellbook for this faction, maybe one of the most magical in all of the game.

**[38:47]** If you use this at the perfect time, you're going to feel like a genius and opener can feel downright broken,

**[38:52]** but using this at the wrong time, cannon will feel awful. Likely you're not going to win and you'll know

**[39:00]** right away that you used this at the wrong time. Watch out for that. It's sort of just an intuition.

**[39:05]** You're going to need to just feel it out and just go for it and experiment in your games to see when's the

**[39:12]** right time to actually use this. One good time to use this might be like spend your Power really aggressively.

**[39:18]** Maybe you ritual and summon a spawn when you started with 10 Power to get as close to zero as possible,

**[39:24]** and then pop this when you know somebody has like 10 or more Power left. That's one option.

**[39:31]** You could wait until someone has like a really good turn. Maybe they end on like five Gates or something.

**[39:36]** They have like 16 or 17 Power and you don't have a lot. You can just like flip it right away and match them.

**[39:43]** That's really nice. Assuming they're going to dominate the action phase, you can kind of hang around and do your

**[39:48]** thing while they're spending Power and the other players are out of Power. That's nice to do.

**[39:54]** Sometimes you might need to use this as an emergency button, pop it for an unimpressive amount of Power,

**[40:00]** like five or six, but you might need to do that at a critical point in the game.

**[40:05]** I've seen this happen in games where like the resources are not flowing and someone's coming for your Gate

**[40:11]** and you just like cannot allow it. I've popped it for sort of an unimpressive amount of Power in that situation,

**[40:18]** but it does something meaningful like taking away multiple Gates or defending your Gates in a really low resource game.

**[40:26]** Yeah, again, I don't have a lot of prescriptive advice on this one.

**[40:29]** You're going to need to feel it out and just sort of build up the intuition of when's the best time to use this in the game.

**[40:39]** Moving on to another Spellbook, we've got Dragon Descending.

**[40:42]** Once only, once during the game when you perform a Ritual of Annihilation,

**[40:47]** you receive twice the normal doom points.

**[40:50]** Flip this Spellbook face down after use to indicate you cannot use it again.

**[40:53]** So another magical challenging puzzle Spellbook. When do you use this exactly?

**[41:02]** Depending on how the game's going, you might only have one shot to do a ritual.

**[41:07]** When you end up on four or five Gates, you may need to just take this even if it doesn't end the game right then and there.

**[41:14]** But the magical number for opener is around 15 or 16 doom.

**[41:20]** If you have that amount of doom and you can manage to close out the action phase with like

**[41:24]** four Gates and a yog and all of your Spellbooks, the game is very likely over.

**[41:29]** And that's because the next doom phase, you'll get your five initial doom that'll put you up to like around 20.

**[41:36]** And then you ritual with a total of five Gates, you'll get 10 doom instead of five,

**[41:41]** plus one Elder Sign. So you should be right around 30 doom, depending on what other Elder Signs you might

**[41:47]** have laying around.

**[41:50]** If you've ever looked at Cthulhu Wars stats, like what we've seen on the Cthulhu Wars discord where you record the

**[41:55]** results of every game, you'll notice a lot of opener wins will typically be right around that like

**[42:01]** 30 to 31 doom for this reason, or maybe around 39 or 40 doom if they weren't able to pull the trigger the round before.

**[42:10]** So again, I don't have prescriptive advice here. You're going to have to just feel out the right time to snap this off.

**[42:16]** It might not actually be the turn that you're going to win, or maybe it will.

**[42:20]** The other thing to just keep in mind, experienced players are going to know about this book and they're going to be

**[42:25]** counting. They're going to know that magic number of 15 or 16 doom, and they might call you out on it.

**[42:31]** So just be prepared for that when it comes up.

**[42:37]** And the last Spellbook we have to discuss is They Breakthrough. It's an ongoing ability.

**[42:42]** You can summon monsters at enemy controlled Gates and abandoned Gates. You do not need to have any other units

**[42:48]** present in the area. This is a cool book. As I mentioned earlier, this one kind of helps you earn

**[42:56]** your two enemy Gates Spellbook requirement without trying too hard, so that's something.

**[43:01]** This is great against factions that have a hard time defending their tertiary Gates like maybe a

**[43:06]** demon sultan or other doom-loving factions. A mutant has a pretty easy time of bullying random acolytes off of

**[43:13]** remote Gates. Maybe it can become an abomination with million favored ones, or maybe you summon an

**[43:19]** abomination right off the bat with the intention of yanking that Gate away from other people.

**[43:25]** I used to be a lot hotter on this Spellbook early on in my journey as a Cthulhu Wars player. I find

**[43:31]** nowadays I use it a little bit more rarely, and that's because I just value million favored ones so much more.

**[43:38]** I would only do that like maybe once ever, otherwise I want to upgrade them if at all possible.

**[43:53]** Don't fall into the trap of like summoning multiple abominations or multiple spawns just so that you can

**[43:58]** get them at enemy Gates. I think that is a trap and you've spent a little bit too much Power doing that.

**[44:03]** You might have to do it in an emergency, you might be doing it for purposes of dread curse and having those units on the map,

**[44:10]** but do not default to doing that. I think you are spending too much Power if you do.

**[44:18]** And I think those are all these Spellbooks taken care of so I will move into opener openings.

**[44:25]** A lot of spice here, a lot of different options, so many permutations I don't think I can cover them all,

**[44:31]** but I will cover some general options here. First one, three Gate opening. You might want to do this

**[44:39]** just so that you can earn your Spellbook requirements, but this is not really like anything special compared

**[44:45]** to any other factions going for this, so you are running the risk of getting captured, like if

**[44:51]** crawling chaos has flight, maybe don't even do this because you're just going to get captured, right?

**[44:56]** But you do need to earn your Spellbook requirements, so building two Gates right off the bat is going to

**[45:01]** definitely get you that eight Gates sooner rather than later.

**[45:05]** My advice if I'm going for three Gates is like maybe talk somebody else into doing it as well.

**[45:11]** Talk crawling chaos into going for three Gates, that's something they're interested in doing themselves

**[45:15]** for their own reasons. That's going to get you a lot closer to that eight and 12 Gate books in no time if someone else goes for three Gates.

**[45:22]** And obviously if you're going to go for three Gates, just don't, you know, don't set up close to anybody if you can help it, right?

**[45:29]** That's just going to make it more difficult for people to get to you. That's what you want.

**[45:33]** You're not going to have the Power to summon monsters and actually protect them properly.

**[45:40]** Next we've got the safe two Gate opening. There's not much to say here.

**[45:44]** You can either summon two mutants or maybe you use an abomination and a beyond one or something with that Power.

**[45:54]** This can set you up for a nice action phase two with 10 Power where other players might be taking the turn off.

**[46:01]** You might have an easier time building more Gates, moving into enemy Gates,

**[46:06]** starting to use battle and million favored ones to gain an advantage.

**[46:10]** All those things are things that you can do in action phase two.

**[46:15]** We've got one Gate and just summoning two spawns right off the bat. That can be kind of cool.

**[46:22]** In action phase two, if you can get an advantageous turn order, you can potentially awaken Yogg spending

**[46:28]** most of your Power. Maybe you immediately take dragon ascending and then flip before somebody else has a

**[46:33]** chance to spend any of their 10 Power. That can feel pretty strong depending on the texture of the game.

**[46:39]** If you steal that 10 Power with dragon ascending, you can use that doing any number of things. Stealing Gates, building more Gates.

**[46:47]** You could easily end on like three to five Gates going into action phase three. So that's a really cool opening as well.

**[46:56]** Last opening to go over really super aggressive aggro million favored ones opening where you choose to set up

**[47:04]** right in the thick of it. Crawling chaos in South Asia, Black Goat in West Africa. You just set up in Arabia.

**[47:10]** You're like right between them. In this opening, you're going to summon a mutant or abomination or spawn.

**[47:17]** Moving into your enemies Gated areas right off the bat and you're earning that two enemy Gates Spellbook requirement.

**[47:23]** You're taking million favored ones right away. And then instead of building Gates,

**[47:27]** you're kind of declaring battles to try to come out ahead in the million favored ones math before you run out of Power.

**[47:35]** If you do this, you can sometimes get a ton of monsters out very early with this opening.

**[47:41]** You're right in the thick of it. You summon a spawn, let's say. You move twice. You should have only two

**[47:47]** Power left, but you can like battle a couple of times. Then that spawn has become four mutants and

**[47:54]** those three of those mutants in a subsequent battle will all become abominations and you'll have three

**[47:59]** abominations and a mutant. That's a really good place to be going into action phase two.

**[48:05]** In action phase two, your goal is to do one or more of the following. Steal a Gate, build a Gate,

**[48:10]** summon yogg since you're probably got a spawn out of using million favored ones shenanigans. You're off to the races.

**[48:16]** I think that's all that I have to say about the openings. I'll move on to playing opener.

**[48:27]** First thing, I've sort of repeated myself several times during the guide, but it bears repeating.

**[48:32]** Map out the game. That 12 Gate Spellbook requirement is your most difficult to earn by far,

**[48:38]** so you really need to plan accordingly if players are not building Gates for you.

**[48:43]** It's possible, but unlikely that you get the opportunity to straight up build two or three

**[48:49]** Gates in an action phase. You don't want to take that risk. You really don't want to get locked into

**[48:54]** building Gates and not doing more interesting or more effective things. People are going to love

**[49:00]** to see you just languishing and building Gates because you have to, to actually be able to win. That feels bad.

**[49:08]** Second piece of advice, you've got a lot of one-cost actions with this faction at your

**[49:12]** disposal, so use those often. You've got battling, you've got beyond one. With million favored ones,

**[49:18]** often you're going to be replacing your acolytes. That can be really helpful to just re-recruit and

**[49:24]** spend your Power really slowly. With million favored ones, if you have a monster and an acolyte at one

**[49:29]** of your Gates and someone shows up trying to capture you, just battle them before they do. Worst case,

**[49:35]** you can get your acolytes safely into your pool and away from capture. Best case, you've upgraded into a

**[49:41]** mutant and maybe an abomination depending on what other monster you had in the area.

**[49:47]** If anyone is foolish enough to just like leave a unit in your area with multiple opener units,

**[49:53]** I'm snapping off that million favored ones like all day long because they just gave you potentially a

**[49:59]** lot of Power that you saved in terms of upgrades.

**[50:01]** Always be looking for those million favored ones opportunities, but don't force it to happen.

**[50:08]** Again, when you don't have a lot of units in the area, you might feel like you're spinning your wheels

**[50:13]** and you're not saving Power. That's true. Just be looking for those advantageous million favored ones

**[50:19]** whenever possible.

**[50:23]** Another thing, look for that perfect dragon ascending opportunity. It may or may not be obvious when exactly

**[50:29]** to do this. You can get it really early to get an edge in Power. You might wait for somebody else to have like an

**[50:35]** insano turn to copy their Power so you can have it too. Otherwise, you might just have a flip that's just

**[50:41]** okay and that's fine too. You're still gaining Power using dragon ascending. Ideally, you're getting as close to zero as

**[50:49]** possible before flipping and that way you have effectively gained as much Power as possible.

**[50:53]** Another thing, do everything that you can to distract from the fact that your doom count is approaching

**[51:02]** that 14 to 16 magical doom number. You do not want everyone knowing that in the next doom phase you can

**[51:10]** easily score like 15 to 17 doom and win. You don't want people to know that or call you out for that

**[51:16]** because they're going to end up working against you the rest of the game.

**[51:18]** Especially, this goes triple if you haven't met your 12 Gates Spellbook requirement.

**[51:25]** You do not want people knowing that you can all of a sudden pop to 30 doom. That's very dangerous.

**[51:33]** I think that's much of what I really have to say on playing opener. I don't think your Spellbook

**[51:38]** requirements aside from the Gates ones are particularly hard to earn. So I don't have a lot of advice on how to earn them.

**[51:44]** They're going to come up a lot of them naturally, so let it happen, don't force it.

**[51:50]** Otherwise, just be hyper focused on getting those Gates built.

**[51:55]** Every action phase I would be shooting for building a Gate if it comes up, if you have the opportunity.

**[52:01]** Build a Gate if you can. Once you get to 12 Gates, your job's done and you can do whatever you want.

**[52:06]** After that, basically, be on the defensive. Maintain your Gate count so that you can try to win,

**[52:13]** maybe with dragon descending in the doom phase. But until that 12 Gates is met,

**[52:17]** you have a very important job, which is building more Gates. Do anything that you can to talk

**[52:22]** people into building Gates for you if possible.

**[52:28]** So I'll move on to thwarting opener. This is a pretty straightforward section here,

**[52:34]** depending on the player count, of course. But in 4 or 5 player games, I would just straight up avoid

**[52:39]** building Gates. This is going to force the opener player to build Gates themselves.

**[52:43]** That sucks for them. If you can lock them into building Gates, they're going to be having a bad

**[52:48]** time and you'll probably be having a good time because you'll have a pretty easy time stealing

**[52:52]** Gates from a faction that just spent like 6 or 8 Power constructing them.

**[52:58]** Next thing, this is not really thwarting opener so much as looking out for yourself, but

**[53:02]** don't get caught by a dread curse. Don't let your great old ones get isolated where they can be sniped.

**[53:07]** Once this starts coming online, make sure your great old one has at least 2 or 3 bodies in the

**[53:12]** area with it. You do not want to have your 10 cost great old one in the area with a random acolyte

**[53:18]** and they roll 5 dice and just roll 2 kills. That sucks for you. You probably lost the game if you get

**[53:24]** sniped like that. Not impossible to come back, but yeah, it's just a huge setback. You just don't want to

**[53:30]** have that happen if you can avoid it. Sometimes it can be worthwhile to even go hunting for spawns

**[53:36]** and abominations just to make dread curse less good. That's going to also limit the amount of

**[53:41]** beyond wanting which can be used against you, so that's something to keep in mind.

**[53:47]** Last thing, dragon descending. Can you count? Do you know how to count? If opener is on 14 to 16 doom,

**[53:54]** you need to make absolutely sure they don't have enough Gates and doom to dragon ritual and win in

**[54:00]** the following doom phase. If you see they're getting to that number, make sure you bring it up, start

**[54:05]** talking to the table about it, get everybody on the same page. Opener cannot be allowed to have

**[54:11]** 4 or 5 Gates and just randomly win. It's an avoidable problem that you can solve through some table talk and

**[54:18]** diplomacy with the other players. I think that about does it for the opener guide, so I'll give you some

**[54:28]** of my closing thoughts. Really cool faction, really creative faction, rewards you for improvising, punishes

**[54:35]** you for having a plan and trying to stick to the plan when the game of Cthulhu Wars is usually constantly changing.

**[54:42]** On the relative Power level of this faction compared to others, I think this is kind of like in the

**[54:51]** middle of the pack, but I will say with the two most recent factions, Bubastus and Demon Sultan,

**[54:57]** openers may be taking a little bit of a hit in terms of Power. With these two factions, cats are

**[55:03]** never building Gates. They might annoy you as the opener player by being at your Gates, although you can

**[55:08]** battle them of course. Demon Sultan likes building Gates, but they can also punish you heavily with

**[55:14]** animate matter, which you don't want. If you're concerned that opener is not winning enough in your group,

**[55:22]** one quick adjustment that you could make to the Spellbook requirements would be

**[55:26]** changing that 12-Gate Spellbook requirement to read only 10 Gates are required on the map, unless it's a 5 or higher

**[55:32]** player count game. That's just going to make it a little bit easier for the opener player

**[55:38]** to earn their Spellbook requirements and not be locked into that really awful play pattern of

**[55:44]** having to build multiple Gates with no other options in order to have any chance of winning the game.

**[55:50]** Just a small note, ignore that if you want.

**[55:55]** I think that's another episode in the book, so thank you very much for listening. Hopefully you

**[55:59]** found this guide useful and you can improve a little bit as an opener player. I'm still learning myself.

**[56:05]** It's one of those ones I think is going to take a lifetime to really become a master.
