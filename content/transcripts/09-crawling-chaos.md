## Transcript

**[00:00]** Narlathotep, The Crawling Chaos.

**[00:03]** I'm the last. I will tell the audience void.

**[00:07]** I do not recall distinctly when it began, but it was months ago.

**[00:11]** The general tension was horrible.

**[00:14]** To a season of political and social upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger.

**[00:21]** A danger widespread and all-embracing.

**[00:24]** Such a danger as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night.

**[00:28]** I recall that the people went about with pale and worried faces and whispered warnings and prophecies which no one dared consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself that he had heard.

**[00:40]** A sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land, and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places.

**[00:50]** There was a demoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasons.

**[00:53]** The autumn heat lingered fearsomely, and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the universe had passed from the control of known gods or forces to that of gods or forces which were unknown.

**[01:05]** It was then that Narlathotep came out of Egypt.

**[01:08]** Who he was, none could tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a pharaoh.

**[01:14]** The felihin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why.

**[01:17]** He said he had risen up out of the blackness of 27 centuries, and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet.

**[01:25]** Into the lands of civilization came Narlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister,

**[01:30]** always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger.

**[01:35]** He spoke much of the sciences, of electricity and psychology,

**[01:39]** and gave exhibitions of Power which sent his spectators away speechless,

**[01:43]** yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude.

**[01:46]** Men advised one another to see Narlathotep and shuddered,

**[01:50]** and where Narlathotep went, rest vanished,

**[01:53]** for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare.

**[01:56]** Never before had the screams of nightmare been such a public problem.

**[02:01]** Now the wise men almost wished they could forbid sleep in the small hours,

**[02:05]** that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the pale,

**[02:09]** pitying moon as it glimmered on green waters,

**[02:12]** gliding under bridges,

**[02:14]** and old steeples crumbling against a sickly sky.

**[02:18]** I remember when Narlathotep came to my city,

**[02:21]** the great, the old, the terrible city of unnumbered crimes.

**[02:25]** My friend had told me of him,

**[02:27]** and of the impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations,

**[02:30]** and I burned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries.

**[02:34]** My friend said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings,

**[02:39]** that what was thrown on the screen in the darkened room

**[02:42]** prophesied things none but Narlathotep dared prophecy,

**[02:46]** and that in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men

**[02:49]** that which had never been taken before,

**[02:52]** yet which showed only in his eyes,

**[02:54]** and I heard it hinted abroad that those who knew Narlathotep

**[02:57]** looked on sights which others saw not.

**[02:59]** It was in that hot autumn that I went through the night

**[03:03]** with the restless crowds to see Narlathotep,

**[03:06]** through the stifling night and up the endless stairs into the choking room,

**[03:10]** and shadowed on a screen,

**[03:11]** I saw hooded forms amidst ruins,

**[03:14]** and yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments.

**[03:18]** And I saw the world battling against blackness,

**[03:21]** against the waves of destruction from ultimate space,

**[03:24]** whirling, churning, struggling around the dimming, cooling sun.

**[03:28]** Then the sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators,

**[03:32]** and hair stood up on end while shadows more grotesque than I can tell

**[03:36]** came out and squatted on the heads.

**[03:38]** And when I, who was colder and more scientific than the rest,

**[03:42]** mumbled a trembling protest about imposture and static electricity,

**[03:46]** Narlathotep drove us all out,

**[03:48]** down the dizzy stairs into the damp, hot, deserted midnight streets.

**[03:52]** I screamed aloud that I was not afraid,

**[03:54]** that I never could be afraid,

**[03:55]** and others screamed for me to solace.

**[03:58]** We swear to one another that the city was exactly the same,

**[04:01]** and still alive,

**[04:02]** and when the electric lights began to fade,

**[04:04]** we cursed the company over and over again,

**[04:07]** and laughed at the queer faces we made.

**[04:09]** I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon,

**[04:12]** for when we began to depend on its light,

**[04:15]** we drifted into curious, involuntary formations,

**[04:17]** and seemed to know our destinations,

**[04:19]** though we dared not think of them.

**[04:20]** Once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks loose and displaced by grass,

**[04:25]** with scarce a line of rusted metal to show where the tramways had run.

**[04:30]** And again we saw the tramcar,

**[04:32]** lone, windowless, dilapidated, and almost on its side.

**[04:36]** When we gazed around the horizon,

**[04:38]** we could not find the third tower by the river,

**[04:40]** and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top.

**[04:44]** Then we split up the narrow columns,

**[04:46]** each of which seemed drawn in a different direction.

**[04:50]** One disappeared in a narrow alley to the left,

**[04:53]** leaving only the echo of a shocking moan.

**[04:56]** Another filed down a weed-choked subway entrance,

**[04:59]** howling with laughter that was mad.

**[05:02]** My own column was sucked toward the open country,

**[05:04]** and presently felt a chill which was not of the hot autumn,

**[05:08]** for as we stalked out on the dark moor,

**[05:11]** we beheld around us the hellish moon glitter of evil snows,

**[05:15]** trackless, inexplicable snows,

**[05:18]** swept asunder in one direction only,

**[05:21]** where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering walls.

**[05:25]** The column seemed very thin indeed,

**[05:27]** as it plodded dreamily into the gulf.

**[05:30]** I lingered behind,

**[05:31]** for the black rift in the green-litten snow was frightful,

**[05:34]** and I thought that I'd heard the reverberations of a disquieting wail

**[05:38]** as my companions vanished,

**[05:40]** but my Power to linger was slight.

**[05:42]** As I beckoned by those who had gone before,

**[05:45]** I half-floated between titanic snowdrifts,

**[05:48]** quivering and afraid into the sightless vortex of the unimaginable.

**[05:52]** Screamingly sentient, dumbly delirious,

**[05:54]** only the gods that were can tell.

**[05:57]** A sickened, sensitive shadow,

**[05:59]** writhing in hands that are not hands,

**[06:01]** and wrought blindly past Ghastly midnights of rotting creation,

**[06:06]** corpses of dead worlds with sores that were cities,

**[06:10]** charnel winds that brush the pallid stars and make them flicker low.

**[06:15]** Beyond the world's vague ghosts of monstrous things,

**[06:18]** half-seen columns of unsanctified temples

**[06:21]** that rest on nameless rocks beneath space

**[06:23]** and reach up to a dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness.

**[06:29]** And through this revolting graveyard of the universe,

**[06:31]** the muffled, maddening beating of drums

**[06:33]** and the thin, monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes

**[06:37]** from inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time.

**[06:41]** The detestable pounding and piping

**[06:43]** where to dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly

**[06:46]** the gigantic, tenebrous ultimate gods,

**[06:49]** the blind, voiceless, mindless gargoyles

**[06:52]** whose soul is Norlathotep.

**[07:09]** Hello, and welcome to Opening the Way.

**[07:13]** My name's Graham.

**[07:14]** I'm your host.

**[07:15]** I'm excited today to bring you another faction guide

**[07:19]** on one of the original four factions, the classic.

**[07:24]** This is the faction guide on Crawling Chaos.

**[07:27]** I want to dedicate this faction guide to my wife.

**[07:32]** This is my wife's favorite faction.

**[07:34]** I'm really, really thankful to have her in my life.

**[07:37]** Somebody who always supports me

**[07:39]** and all the really specific hobbies

**[07:41]** that I tend to get involved in.

**[07:44]** I really appreciate you.

**[07:45]** Always appreciate you.

**[07:48]** You heard in the opening there,

**[07:49]** I just read to you the entirety

**[07:51]** of the Norlathotep story by H.P. Lovecraft.

**[07:54]** It's not very long,

**[07:55]** but I think it does get the point across

**[07:57]** kind of what this faction's about,

**[07:59]** what this great old one's about.

**[08:01]** A lot of the great old ones in this game

**[08:03]** and these stories are sort of mindless entities

**[08:07]** that are just kind of there and doing their own thing.

**[08:11]** Norlathotep is a little bit different.

**[08:12]** He's the only one of them with a conscience.

**[08:15]** I think he's the only one of them

**[08:16]** that is hanging out on Earth,

**[08:18]** doing his own thing,

**[08:19]** and he's kind of rude.

**[08:21]** He's not really trying to help anybody.

**[08:23]** He's sort of just there to make mischief.

**[08:26]** I think mischief is like a kind way to put it.

**[08:29]** He's really there to create mayhem.

**[08:32]** He reminds me a lot of the Joker.

**[08:34]** I think that he is sort of the Lovecraftian representation of Satan,

**[08:39]** like somebody that you would make a deal with

**[08:41]** and he would be telling you later

**[08:43]** about careful what you wish for.

**[08:46]** Kind of reminds me of the shop owner

**[08:48]** from Needful Things

**[08:50]** that can get you anything that you need

**[08:52]** from Stephen King.

**[08:53]** Maybe he reminds me even more

**[08:55]** of the villain from Stephen King

**[08:57]** who's recurring in many different stories.

**[09:00]** Randall Flagg is probably what he's best known as,

**[09:02]** but he's Walter in the Dark Tower.

**[09:06]** Anyway, this is a troublemaker

**[09:08]** and that's putting it lightly.

**[09:11]** So let's talk about the faction a little bit

**[09:13]** with my opening thoughts.

**[09:14]** This is probably the most devious faction

**[09:18]** in the whole game.

**[09:19]** A lot of social engineering aspects to this faction.

**[09:24]** There's specifically this madness Spellbook,

**[09:27]** which I'll talk in great detail about.

**[09:29]** Completely warps the game.

**[09:30]** People are going to have to talk with you

**[09:33]** in order to get you to let them do what they want

**[09:37]** because they're not going to be getting pained

**[09:39]** the way that they thought they would,

**[09:40]** like in other games of Cthulhu Wars.

**[09:43]** You're going to need to figure out

**[09:44]** how to naviGate your way through games

**[09:46]** with and without Crawling Chaos

**[09:48]** because those are two very different things.

**[09:51]** It's almost a meme

**[09:53]** in some of the episodes I've recorded so far,

**[09:55]** and Arlothab is always the bad guy in my examples.

**[09:57]** Maybe you'll understand why

**[09:58]** after listening to this guide.

**[10:01]** This is one of, if not the most

**[10:05]** Great Old One-centric faction.

**[10:08]** Narlathotep is your bread and butter.

**[10:10]** Nearly all of your plans in winning the game

**[10:13]** revolve around having Narlathotep in play,

**[10:16]** so awakening as early as possible

**[10:18]** and keeping him alive for as long as possible

**[10:20]** is key to your success.

**[10:23]** You want to be wheeling and dealing as this faction,

**[10:26]** making deals with people,

**[10:27]** but I will also say just being cruel,

**[10:30]** being mean is going to get you far here.

**[10:33]** I like keeping my word in games of Cthulhu Wars,

**[10:36]** but I have to say it's not binding,

**[10:39]** so backstabbing is a thing.

**[10:42]** This faction in particular,

**[10:43]** backstabbing at the perfect moment

**[10:44]** when you are in alliance with somebody

**[10:46]** can really win you the game,

**[10:48]** you might need to do that,

**[10:50]** you might want to do that,

**[10:52]** either one's okay,

**[10:53]** make sure you forgive each other

**[10:55]** and talk it out afterwards.

**[10:58]** I think it's a testament to

**[10:59]** how well this game is designed,

**[11:01]** that this faction still holds up.

**[11:02]** I still think it's one of the strongest factions

**[11:04]** in the game when played in the right hands.

**[11:07]** It's incredibly dangerous,

**[11:08]** I think it's one of the most dangerous factions,

**[11:11]** if not the most dangerous,

**[11:12]** once they get all of their Spellbooks,

**[11:13]** and we'll talk more about how to do that.

**[11:17]** Starting with the faction overview,

**[11:19]** setup for this faction,

**[11:20]** very simple,

**[11:21]** 8 Power,

**[11:22]** 6 acolytes,

**[11:23]** always in South Asia.

**[11:25]** No brainer,

**[11:26]** if you've played Cthulhu Wars,

**[11:27]** you've probably seen this setup before.

**[11:29]** The unique faction ability

**[11:30]** for Crawling Chaos is Flight.

**[11:33]** All your units can fly,

**[11:35]** even Cultist.

**[11:36]** They can fly over two areas

**[11:38]** containing enemy units.

**[11:39]** This is a movement ability,

**[11:41]** the ability to move multiple spaces,

**[11:42]** most factions have something like this.

**[11:46]** I really think this is one of the best

**[11:48]** movement abilities in the game,

**[11:49]** probably just the best.

**[11:50]** This is going to allow Crawling Chaos

**[11:52]** to take Gates in the remotest areas of the map

**[11:55]** in the early game with ease,

**[11:57]** and in the mid to late game,

**[11:59]** there's nowhere that you can hide from this faction

**[12:01]** because of Flight.

**[12:02]** They're always going to be able to find you.

**[12:04]** At most,

**[12:05]** you're always two moves away

**[12:07]** from Crawling Chaos,

**[12:08]** at best.

**[12:09]** So just always keep that in mind,

**[12:11]** especially when they have unlimited combat.

**[12:15]** Flight is amazing.

**[12:16]** We'll do a Sleeper guide at some point,

**[12:19]** but Sleeper can copy abilities

**[12:21]** with Ancient Sorcery,

**[12:22]** and I think Flight is nearly at the top

**[12:24]** of the list for abilities they want to copy.

**[12:26]** So in terms of ranking the unique faction abilities

**[12:30]** of all factions,

**[12:31]** I think Flight is probably in the top two

**[12:33]** or the top three.

**[12:34]** Let's get into Spellbook requirements

**[12:37]** for Crawling Chaos.

**[12:38]** First one is Capture OcCultist.

**[12:42]** This is a very simple Spellbook requirement.

**[12:45]** I actually think it would be more difficult

**[12:46]** for other factions to get this

**[12:48]** than it is for Crawling Chaos.

**[12:50]** It should be pretty straightforward

**[12:51]** to get this book.

**[12:53]** There's nowhere that is really out of reach

**[12:55]** for this faction.

**[12:56]** Narlathotep himself is going to be

**[12:58]** really your key to capturing other acolytes,

**[13:01]** and you're not really going to have to worry

**[13:04]** too much about him getting killed

**[13:05]** by random monsters,

**[13:07]** and that's because of his Emissary of the Outer Gods Spellbook,

**[13:10]** which we'll discuss a little bit more later.

**[13:13]** The next two Spellbook requirements,

**[13:15]** I'm going to kind of talk about them as a group.

**[13:18]** Those are Pay 4 Power and Pay 6 Power.

**[13:22]** Each of those is an action.

**[13:24]** If you want to,

**[13:25]** you're allowed to spend 10 Power at once

**[13:27]** to earn two Spellbooks at once.

**[13:29]** What I really have to say about these

**[13:31]** is that they are expensive.

**[13:34]** You're going to be spending over 20 Power

**[13:36]** to win the game as this faction.

**[13:38]** Don't delay in getting these Spellbooks.

**[13:41]** If you're getting beat down

**[13:43]** and you're at minimum Power,

**[13:44]** there's nothing worse than

**[13:46]** not being able to get to your unlimited combat

**[13:48]** because you haven't paid for these already.

**[13:51]** It doesn't feel great,

**[13:52]** but eating the cost of these early and often

**[13:55]** is something that you'll be glad you did later on.

**[13:57]** When other factions start getting unlimited combat,

**[14:00]** you really don't want to be locked behind this paywall

**[14:03]** in order to get that for yourself.

**[14:06]** The next two requirements are also kind of similar,

**[14:09]** so I will describe them in a group as well.

**[14:11]** One is have three Gates or 12 Power,

**[14:15]** and the other one is have four Gates or 15 Power.

**[14:18]** You're probably going to be able to get three Gates

**[14:21]** fairly easily in action phase three.

**[14:24]** It's likely you're going to have two Gates.

**[14:26]** You can just build another Gate.

**[14:28]** That's pretty easy to do.

**[14:29]** Again, crawling chaos with flight,

**[14:31]** you're able to get to these remote areas

**[14:33]** that other players may be distant from,

**[14:35]** and that's just going to let you build Gates quite easily.

**[14:38]** Of course, you may also be able to

**[14:40]** get the 12 Power through captures

**[14:42]** or through gaining Power in some other way,

**[14:46]** like through Harbinger or Thousand Forms,

**[14:49]** which we will discuss in a little bit.

**[14:52]** Before Gates and 15 Power is a little trickier,

**[14:55]** but again, like the Capture Cultist Spellbook requirement,

**[14:58]** I do think this will tend to happen naturally

**[15:01]** over the course of the game.

**[15:02]** Players are going to fight over Gates.

**[15:04]** You may find a situation,

**[15:06]** it's not that uncommon for there to be one or more Gates,

**[15:09]** just devoid of units,

**[15:11]** because two players were fighting there

**[15:13]** and everybody got pained out.

**[15:15]** You've got flight, so do your acolytes.

**[15:16]** You're on two Gates, and there's two abandoned Gates.

**[15:20]** You can quickly fly two acolytes into position,

**[15:24]** if only for a moment,

**[15:26]** and you'll gain your three

**[15:28]** and maybe your four Gate Spellbooks from doing that.

**[15:32]** The last Spellbook requirement

**[15:33]** is something you're probably expecting,

**[15:36]** which is awaken Narlathotep.

**[15:38]** Not much to say here.

**[15:39]** Your great old one is expensive.

**[15:41]** It's 10 cost.

**[15:42]** We'll talk more about that in a minute,

**[15:44]** but don't delay in getting this either.

**[15:47]** Narlathotep is essential to your strategy,

**[15:49]** probably more than any other faction.

**[15:51]** 99% you want to do this in action phase 2.

**[15:55]** Definitely no later than action phase 3

**[15:57]** if you can avoid it.

**[15:59]** Okay, now we'll discuss the units for crawling chaos,

**[16:04]** starting with Nightgaunts.

**[16:05]** Out of what crypt they crawl,

**[16:08]** I cannot tell.

**[16:09]** But every night I see the rubbery things,

**[16:12]** black, horned, and slender with membranous wings.

**[16:15]** They come in legions on the north wind's swell,

**[16:18]** with obscene clutch that titillates and stings,

**[16:21]** snatching me off on monstrous voyagings

**[16:24]** to gray worlds hidden deep in nightmares well.

**[16:27]** Over the jagged peaks of thok they sweep,

**[16:30]** heedless of all the cries I try to make,

**[16:33]** and down in the nether pits to that foul lake

**[16:35]** where the puffed Shoggoths splash in doubtful sleep.

**[16:38]** O'ho, if they would only make a sound,

**[16:42]** or wear a face where faces should be found.

**[16:46]** That's a poem from H.P. Lovecraft about the Nightgaunts.

**[16:51]** I'm holding one here in front of me.

**[16:53]** It's just a sweet little guy.

**[16:56]** Looks like a little demon.

**[16:57]** Got big wings, got some horns.

**[17:00]** Definitely no face.

**[17:02]** They seem to hang out in the dreamland.

**[17:04]** They're Narlathotep's minions.

**[17:07]** And let's talk about how they work in Cthulhu Wars.

**[17:11]** Crawling Chaos has three of these.

**[17:13]** They cost one to summon,

**[17:15]** and they have zero combat.

**[17:17]** This is a flimsy unit,

**[17:19]** but an efficiently costed one.

**[17:23]** Notably, these have zero combat,

**[17:25]** so they cannot initiate battles

**[17:26]** because you need to be able to roll at least one die

**[17:29]** in order to do that.

**[17:30]** But Nightgaunts can still be effective

**[17:32]** at capturing units just because of flight

**[17:34]** and how easy it is for any crawling chaos units

**[17:37]** to get into the right location.

**[17:39]** If somebody moves into an area

**[17:42]** in order to build a Gate,

**[17:43]** it's very easy to meet them there with a Nightgaunt

**[17:45]** and leave them with the choice of

**[17:47]** move out of the way or build a Gate

**[17:49]** and get captured before you can summon a monster.

**[17:52]** One cost actions are good.

**[17:54]** You've heard me say that many times.

**[17:56]** With this faction,

**[17:57]** you're going to be summoning Nightgaunts

**[17:58]** and probably getting them killed pretty frequently.

**[18:00]** Just remember that having bodies in the battle

**[18:04]** on your side is a good thing

**[18:05]** when you're trying to soak up hits.

**[18:07]** For you, keeping Narlathotep alive is top priority.

**[18:10]** Any amount of Nightgaunts that you need to throw

**[18:12]** under the bus to do that is probably worth doing.

**[18:16]** The Spellbook that works with Nightgaunts is Abduct,

**[18:20]** which we'll talk about more in a bit.

**[18:22]** That basically lets them sacrifice themselves

**[18:24]** to also take out an enemy unit

**[18:26]** before the combat dice get rolled into battle.

**[18:29]** Not the most useful Spellbook in the world,

**[18:32]** but we'll talk about its applications shortly.

**[18:36]** The next monster we have for the Crawling Chaos faction

**[18:39]** is the Flying Polyps.

**[18:43]** I'm not totally sure how they're flying.

**[18:46]** They don't have any wings.

**[18:48]** They look really like a gross...

**[18:51]** I don't know.

**[18:52]** Almost like a grub.

**[18:53]** They have a mouth.

**[18:54]** They've got many eyes.

**[18:56]** They've got many tentacles.

**[18:57]** It kind of looks like a couple of different things

**[19:01]** got thrown into an oven.

**[19:04]** I'm kind of getting a little bit of a...

**[19:06]** Like the fly where...

**[19:08]** I don't know if you've ever seen that movie with Jeff Goldblum.

**[19:10]** It kind of gets baked together with a fly.

**[19:12]** This kind of reminds me of several different things

**[19:14]** getting baked together,

**[19:16]** and I don't know if it's good for them,

**[19:18]** but the Flying Polyp looks kind of happy though,

**[19:20]** so maybe it's okay.

**[19:22]** The Flying Polyps, you've got three of them.

**[19:24]** They cost two Power to summon,

**[19:26]** and they have one combat.

**[19:28]** This is the cheapest unit that Crawling Chaos can muster

**[19:31]** that can actually roll a die.

**[19:33]** They don't have the best rate in the world,

**[19:35]** costing two, only giving you one combat,

**[19:37]** but they can at least declare a combat,

**[19:40]** and flight lets them get anywhere they need to be.

**[19:43]** They also have a pretty useful Spellbook in Invisibility,

**[19:46]** which we'll talk a lot more about shortly.

**[19:47]** That's going to allow them to turn the tide in a decisive battle

**[19:52]** by making sure that an enemy is not participating,

**[19:55]** or they can even protect themselves with it.

**[19:58]** The Spellbook is good on offense or defense.

**[20:01]** I'll talk in more detail about it shortly.

**[20:04]** The last monster for Crawling Chaos,

**[20:07]** we have the Hunting Horrors.

**[20:09]** These ones are really cool looking.

**[20:11]** They look like a bit like a snake.

**[20:13]** Many eyes.

**[20:15]** Got a couple sets of wings.

**[20:16]** They're coiled.

**[20:17]** They're ready to strike.

**[20:19]** They look very deadly.

**[20:22]** You've got two Hunting Horrors.

**[20:23]** They cost three, and they have two combat.

**[20:26]** These are pretty inefficiently costed,

**[20:29]** but they're still quite effective.

**[20:31]** That's mainly because you won't really be moving them

**[20:34]** into battle much, hopefully,

**[20:36]** because their Spellbook, which is called Seek and Destroy,

**[20:39]** in the pre-battle, lets you fly in

**[20:41]** any amount of Hunting Horrors for free

**[20:43]** before the dice are rolled.

**[20:44]** These units provide more value the longer that they survive,

**[20:51]** so the more battles they can fly into and survive.

**[20:54]** You really want to be avoiding getting these killed

**[20:56]** as much as possible.

**[20:58]** Obviously, if you need Narlathotep to survive,

**[21:01]** by all means kill your Hunting Horrors,

**[21:03]** but every Power matters for this faction.

**[21:06]** Avoid having to spend three Power to resummon these if possible.

**[21:10]** The last unit for the Crawling Chaos faction,

**[21:15]** we have the man himself, Narlathotep.

**[21:18]** This is a crazy-looking sculpt.

**[21:20]** He's like a tripod standing on three large tentacles.

**[21:25]** Got kind of a long tentacle head.

**[21:28]** Doesn't seem to have many eyes.

**[21:30]** Maybe one eye right in the center of the chest.

**[21:32]** One mouth-like thing in the belly area.

**[21:37]** Crazy claws that are kind of being articulated in a way.

**[21:42]** I always feel like this unit is looking like he's flexing on people.

**[21:47]** When you're playing this faction well, you're going to flex.

**[21:50]** Seems very cocky.

**[21:51]** He's very overconfident about being in any battle that he wants to fight in.

**[21:57]** How to awaken Narlathotep.

**[21:59]** You must have a controlled Gate.

**[22:01]** You need to pay 10 Power,

**[22:02]** and Narlathotep appears at the controlled Gate.

**[22:05]** The combat of this great old one is equal to

**[22:08]** the total of your own faction Spellbooks

**[22:10]** plus the faction Spellbooks of your opponent in the battle.

**[22:14]** So that's a maximum of 12 dice if both players have all their books.

**[22:18]** The ability for Narlathotep is very spicy,

**[22:22]** and that is the Harbinger.

**[22:24]** That's post-battle.

**[22:25]** If Narlathotep is in a battle in which

**[22:27]** one or more enemy great old ones are pained or killed,

**[22:31]** you receive Power equal to half the cost to awaken those great old ones.

**[22:35]** Per enemy old one,

**[22:36]** you may choose to receive two Elder Signs instead of Power.

**[22:40]** Harbinger takes effect even if Narlathotep is killed or pained in the battle himself.

**[22:44]** This whole faction revolves around your great old one,

**[22:49]** and this ability is really your win condition.

**[22:51]** If you're playing this faction,

**[22:53]** and you're not trying to score Elder Signs off this ability,

**[22:55]** I think that you're kind of doing it wrong.

**[22:58]** This ability becomes very, very strong

**[23:01]** once you unlock unlimited battle

**[23:03]** because of the train of pain

**[23:04]** that we discussed in our advanced tactics guide.

**[23:07]** If you're playing this faction well,

**[23:09]** you're going to be able to end a lot of games

**[23:11]** in a burst of two or four or six Elder Signs

**[23:15]** by using Harbinger,

**[23:16]** painting great old ones,

**[23:18]** gaining some Elder Signs,

**[23:19]** or some Power.

**[23:21]** Should you gain Power or Elder Signs

**[23:23]** kind of depends on which great old ones you just fought against,

**[23:27]** but I would say a good rule of thumb is

**[23:29]** the cheaper great old ones are better for the Elder Signs,

**[23:32]** so maybe anything like the king

**[23:34]** or Cthulhu is only going to get you

**[23:37]** two Power because of how immortal works.

**[23:41]** I would rather take the Elder Signs,

**[23:42]** so maybe like a Ran Tagoth

**[23:44]** is another juicy target for Elder Signs.

**[23:47]** Any great old ones that are going to cost

**[23:49]** eight or ten Power to awaken,

**[23:51]** those are good targets for a Power.

**[23:54]** If Narlathotep is able to survive,

**[23:56]** and you're able to get four Power out of the deal,

**[23:58]** you may have just paid for the battle,

**[24:00]** and you may have even come out ahead

**[24:01]** and made a little bit of a profit.

**[24:02]** Try to time it so that you can gain

**[24:06]** an explosive amount of Elder Signs

**[24:07]** before what you see as the final phase of the game.

**[24:11]** That's a great way to end the game as this faction.

**[24:14]** Okay, with units out of the way,

**[24:16]** we can get into the Spellbooks.

**[24:19]** I'm going to start with what I consider

**[24:21]** the signature Spellbook of this faction,

**[24:23]** and that is Madness.

**[24:24]** It's a post-battle ability.

**[24:26]** After all pain results are assigned to units,

**[24:28]** but before they're applied,

**[24:30]** you choose where all units are pained to

**[24:32]** rather than their owner.

**[24:33]** You can pain them in any order,

**[24:35]** rather than attacker, then defender as normal,

**[24:38]** but must still follow all other rules due to pains.

**[24:42]** Do this even in battles in which you do not participate.

**[24:45]** Let that sink in for a minute.

**[24:47]** As soon as you earn this Spellbook,

**[24:48]** every battle the rest of the game,

**[24:50]** you're going to get to decide

**[24:51]** where units are pained to.

**[24:53]** I would put this among the strongest Spellbooks in the game,

**[24:57]** and that's because this ability just completely warps

**[25:00]** what people are going to want to do

**[25:01]** or what people are going to be able to do.

**[25:04]** I've mentioned in some other guides,

**[25:06]** like the Cthulhu guide,

**[25:07]** about how Cthulhu really needs to be friends with Crawling Chaos.

**[25:10]** This is kind of why.

**[25:11]** If you're on Crawling Chaos' bad side

**[25:13]** and you're in a battle,

**[25:14]** they're going to make you go to a really bad position,

**[25:18]** either so they can take advantage of it

**[25:20]** or somebody else can take advantage of it.

**[25:23]** This is a really great book to use politically.

**[25:25]** You should be wheeling and dealing as this faction

**[25:27]** and making alliances.

**[25:29]** Ask your allies how they want to be pained

**[25:32]** and do what they say,

**[25:34]** or maybe not if you want to stab them in the back.

**[25:37]** Your enemies, I would generally just scatter them to the winds.

**[25:40]** Maybe not Black Goat

**[25:41]** because you don't want to put them in many areas.

**[25:44]** Good idea against any death ball,

**[25:46]** any huge fight happens,

**[25:47]** just split them apart as much as possible.

**[25:49]** You may even be able to initiate a surround

**[25:52]** with the way that you pain

**[25:54]** and cause another faction to eliminate an extra unit,

**[25:57]** so that's pretty cool too.

**[25:59]** And just a PSA, I'll do it here.

**[26:01]** Always be on top of your madness.

**[26:03]** Make sure that your Crawling Chaos players

**[26:05]** are not drinking too much alcohol

**[26:07]** or anything like that when you're playing Cthulhu Wars.

**[26:09]** There's really nothing worse than

**[26:11]** Crawling Chaos slowing the game down to a halt

**[26:13]** because they're not paying attention

**[26:15]** and they're not on top of every battle.

**[26:16]** You really want Crawling Chaos to be snappy,

**[26:19]** just paying attention to every battle

**[26:21]** so that they can quickly do their madness afterward

**[26:24]** and pain everything out.

**[26:25]** Make sure you tell them what's getting pained

**[26:28]** and get on their case about doing it with the quickness.

**[26:31]** The next Spellbook for Crawling Chaos

**[26:35]** is Emissary of the Outer Gods.

**[26:37]** Post-battle ability.

**[26:39]** Unless an enemy Great Old One is involved in the battle,

**[26:42]** a kill applied to Narlathotep becomes a pain.

**[26:44]** Also, if Narlathotep cannot be pained

**[26:47]** due to being surrounded, he's not eliminated.

**[26:50]** This is another really key Spellbook for this faction.

**[26:53]** Again, your whole strategy revolves around your Great Old One,

**[26:56]** so you really do not want to take any chances.

**[26:59]** You do not want Narlathotep to be killed by random monsters,

**[27:03]** so I would take this book almost every time

**[27:06]** Narlathotep is awakened, if possible,

**[27:09]** because you cannot afford to have your Great Old One getting killed

**[27:11]** when it's not in a fight against other Great Old Ones.

**[27:14]** This is really great protection.

**[27:16]** This is also going to make it trivial for you

**[27:18]** to move into a random Gate

**[27:20]** and get your Spellbook that requires you to capture.

**[27:23]** Nobody's going to be able to kill you.

**[27:24]** The worst they can do is battle you and pain you away,

**[27:26]** which they may even pain you into another area with another Gate,

**[27:30]** and that's going to enable you to take that Spellbook too.

**[27:34]** The next Spellbook we've got here is Thousand Forms.

**[27:37]** It's a zero-cost action.

**[27:39]** If Narlathotep is in play, roll a d6.

**[27:42]** Your foes lose that much Power between them.

**[27:45]** They have one minute to decide how much each loses.

**[27:48]** If they can't agree,

**[27:49]** you get the rolled number as Power added to your total.

**[27:52]** Flip this Spellbook face down to indicate it cannot be used again in this action phase.

**[27:56]** During gather Power, flip it face up again.

**[28:00]** I love this Spellbook.

**[28:01]** I love the name of the Spellbook.

**[28:02]** I don't think I said this at the top of the guide,

**[28:04]** but this is kind of in reference to Narlathotep is a shapeshifter.

**[28:08]** He can take any form.

**[28:10]** He can be anyone or anything.

**[28:12]** This is a really cool social mechanic in this faction here.

**[28:17]** You're going to need to have the other players either cooperate with each other to thwart the Power gain,

**[28:22]** or maybe you've already been sweet-talking some people in the game,

**[28:27]** and they're going to ask you,

**[28:28]** hey, what are you going to do with that Power?

**[28:29]** And you say,

**[28:30]** not going to bother you.

**[28:31]** And they're going to say,

**[28:33]** okay, I don't want to pay for that four or five.

**[28:35]** And they're going to really put the screws to maybe the other players that really do want to pay,

**[28:39]** or maybe they're not even able to play.

**[28:41]** If you are able to gain a decent amount of Power with this book,

**[28:44]** it's going to really help you offset the cost of some of the Spellbook requirements,

**[28:48]** like the pay four Power and pay six Power.

**[28:51]** My advice for making sure that you get the Power from this book is to bargain with your allies.

**[28:57]** Tell them what you'll do with this Power that you won't hurt them,

**[29:00]** or maybe you will hurt them anyway,

**[29:02]** but just tell them that you won't hurt them.

**[29:03]** The variance on this book can lead to some really swingy games.

**[29:09]** So sometimes you have games where you can't stop rolling ones or twos,

**[29:13]** and everyone's kind of snickering and laughing at you.

**[29:15]** And of course, I'm not going to pay.

**[29:17]** You can have a one.

**[29:18]** Sometimes you roll fives and sixes the whole game.

**[29:21]** That can make this faction feel pretty unstoppable.

**[29:23]** I just played a game the other day where I rolled three sixes.

**[29:26]** So sorry to everybody in that game.

**[29:28]** That was a lot.

**[29:30]** When you are rolling the high numbers,

**[29:32]** my advice to your opponents would be always try to pay,

**[29:35]** because six Power is just so much.

**[29:36]** That's enough to move and build a Gate.

**[29:38]** You really don't want to be in a situation where folks are getting down to the wire on their last Power,

**[29:44]** and then Crawling Chaos somehow skyrockets back up to seven Power.

**[29:47]** As to when to use this book,

**[29:50]** you could use this early on in the action phase,

**[29:53]** possibly to reach your Spellbook requirements of,

**[29:56]** you could have three Gates or four Gates,

**[29:58]** but you could also have 12 or 15 Power.

**[30:00]** This might get you from 10 to 12 or 12 to 15,

**[30:04]** things like that.

**[30:05]** Again, that's going to require some cooperation.

**[30:07]** People aren't going to necessarily want to give you a Spellbook for free,

**[30:10]** but maybe you can talk them into it.

**[30:12]** The other option is much later on in the action phase.

**[30:16]** Maybe when you have one Power left is the last possible time you can use this.

**[30:20]** You can wait till later when one or more players don't have the Power to pay for this.

**[30:24]** If you roll four,

**[30:25]** maybe nobody can pay,

**[30:26]** and you're going to get the Power no matter what.

**[30:28]** That's the best case scenario.

**[30:30]** And of course,

**[30:31]** you can do this anywhere in between the start of the action phase and the end of the action phase.

**[30:35]** Look for a good spot when people may be fighting with each other.

**[30:38]** It's going to be a nice way to stall for one turn,

**[30:41]** but also can set people against each other just by their willingness to pay or their refusal to pay.

**[30:47]** Last thing on this book,

**[30:48]** I would take it very early,

**[30:50]** and I would use it every action phase.

**[30:52]** There's no reason not to.

**[30:54]** Unless Narlathotep gets killed,

**[30:55]** you should be using this every action phase.

**[30:57]** In the worst case,

**[30:58]** people are paying for it,

**[30:59]** and you're just subtracting Power from them,

**[31:01]** which is still something that you want to be doing.

**[31:03]** Okay, moving on to our first monster-specific Spellbook.

**[31:10]** That's going to be Invisibility.

**[31:11]** So this is the one that works with Flying Polyps.

**[31:15]** It's a pre-battle ability.

**[31:17]** Select one monster or Cultist from either faction per Flying Polyp present and exempt it from the battle.

**[31:22]** The selected unit does not participate in the rest of the battle.

**[31:25]** I love this book,

**[31:26]** and I love Flying Polyps.

**[31:28]** I feel like they're slightly underutilized.

**[31:30]** I found this one to be very potent in the last couple of games I've played as Crawling Chaos.

**[31:35]** This book is very good on offense or defense.

**[31:39]** Notably, you get to choose the thing being accepted from the battle,

**[31:43]** which is kind of unusual.

**[31:44]** This is especially good against a particular monster that can roll a lot of dice.

**[31:49]** Spawn of Yogg-Sototh,

**[31:51]** Formless Spawn,

**[31:52]** Star Spawn,

**[31:53]** things like that.

**[31:54]** In a decisive battle,

**[31:56]** you may be able to exempt the units aside from Great Old Ones,

**[31:59]** which are rolling the most dice,

**[32:01]** and really swing the battle in your favor.

**[32:03]** I like it for that reason on offense.

**[32:05]** Once you have unlimited battle,

**[32:07]** flying in a couple of polyps alongside Narlothotep can really make it so that there's only a couple of units,

**[32:13]** one of them being the target that you're after,

**[32:15]** actually in the battle.

**[32:16]** That's really handy.

**[32:17]** I also like this as a way to prey on those lightly guarded Gates that maybe only have one monster and one Cultist.

**[32:25]** You can fly in,

**[32:26]** you can exempt the monster rolling the dice,

**[32:29]** and then you've got pretty much a 1 in 3 chance of rolling a pain and or a kill,

**[32:34]** and that's going to affect the acolyte in the area,

**[32:36]** and you can maybe fly something in to recruit or take the Gate.

**[32:39]** This ability is very annoying to deal with.

**[32:43]** Provided the flying polyps stay alive,

**[32:45]** this can be a real headache,

**[32:46]** especially from your opponent's point of view

**[32:48]** when they're trying to assassinate Narlothotep,

**[32:50]** and they're just not going to be able to muster the dice to do that.

**[32:54]** This ability is also very effective defending random Gates that you have,

**[32:58]** maybe with one Cultist.

**[33:00]** It's really going to require the opponent to move in a Great Old One

**[33:03]** or move in multiple monsters.

**[33:06]** A lone monster marching up to your Gate with the flying polyp and acolyte,

**[33:11]** they're just not going to be able to battle you away,

**[33:13]** because every time they declare a battle,

**[33:14]** you can just invisibility their monster,

**[33:17]** and they won't roll any dice,

**[33:18]** and you'll just be sitting there,

**[33:20]** and they will have wasted one Power moving and one Power battling.

**[33:24]** One last thing about invisibility,

**[33:27]** it functionally is going to make your flying polyps indestructible.

**[33:31]** Let's picture an example on defense again.

**[33:33]** There's a big death ball coming to your random Gate

**[33:36]** where you only have an acolyte and a flying polyp.

**[33:39]** You know you're not going to win this battle,

**[33:40]** you know you're going to get pained out at best,

**[33:42]** more likely they're going to just roll a couple of kills on you

**[33:45]** and just kill both your units.

**[33:47]** In that case, just have the flying polyp exempt itself.

**[33:51]** It will never get killed, it will never get pained,

**[33:53]** it will just hang out in that area

**[33:54]** and continue to menace the Gate.

**[33:57]** I find this can be useful with a flying polyp around the map

**[34:01]** on any random Gate.

**[34:02]** Maybe there's some Gate in the game that is being fought over very frequently.

**[34:06]** You can just have a flying polyp there just continually menacing the Gate.

**[34:10]** No one's actually going to be able to come and kill it because of invisibility,

**[34:13]** and you can kind of just, at your leisure,

**[34:16]** when you decide you do want that Gate,

**[34:18]** you've already got a really useful monster and ability in there to help you claim it.

**[34:22]** The next Spellbook we're going to discuss is Abduct.

**[34:28]** This is the one that works with the Night Gaunts.

**[34:30]** Pre-battle ability, eliminate one or more Night Gaunts in the battle.

**[34:34]** For each such Night Gaunt, your enemy must eliminate a monster or Cultist around the battle.

**[34:39]** Interesting ability.

**[34:41]** This is going to put Night Gaunts back into your pool,

**[34:43]** which only cost one,

**[34:45]** and I kind of like that as a way to just kind of continually take one-cost actions

**[34:49]** if you're able to get Night Gaunts into the battle in the first place.

**[34:52]** But remember, your Night Gaunts,

**[34:53]** they don't roll any dice themselves,

**[34:54]** so they're not able to declare battles and eat units.

**[34:58]** This can be, again, a nice way of defending your random Gates

**[35:02]** from random monsters that are moving in.

**[35:04]** If, say, an expensive monster or a star spawn moves in to try to fight your Gate,

**[35:09]** just lose your Night Gaunt before the battle,

**[35:11]** and their monster is gone, and you still have your Gate,

**[35:13]** and they wasted a bunch of Power.

**[35:15]** I like this in the big fights as well.

**[35:17]** It can be valuable when you're trying to trade up and get the kills on great old ones.

**[35:22]** If there's a bunch of bodies in the battle,

**[35:25]** maybe you spent a lot moving units into the area,

**[35:27]** you can just eliminate your Night Gaunts.

**[35:30]** The opponent chooses what they give up in this case,

**[35:32]** but they're going to give up their least expensive unit,

**[35:34]** and that's going to leave the big, juicy targets for you

**[35:36]** that cost a lot of Power for the opponent to awaken.

**[35:39]** Not the most useful Spellbook,

**[35:41]** but it does have its place, and there are some applications.

**[35:46]** The last Spellbook for Crawling Chaos,

**[35:48]** we have Seek and Destroy, which works with the Hunting Horrors.

**[35:52]** It's a pre-battle ability.

**[35:54]** Immediately move any or all Hunting Horrors from any area

**[35:57]** into the battle area.

**[35:58]** I mentioned this earlier when I was talking about the horrors themselves.

**[36:01]** It's a very strong movement ability.

**[36:03]** You're basically never going to be moving your hunting horrors

**[36:06]** because you don't need to.

**[36:07]** As soon as you have Seek and Destroy,

**[36:09]** they can fly in and participate in every battle that you want.

**[36:12]** I really like this as a tactic when you want to assassinate those great old ones,

**[36:16]** and you fly in Crawling Chaos and maybe a couple other bodies.

**[36:20]** If you have Seek and Destroy in both your horrors,

**[36:23]** you're flying in 4 Power worth of dice and extra bodies to soak up hits on your side.

**[36:28]** It's just a great addition to the possible 12 combat of Narlathotep.

**[36:32]** If you fly in both horrors, you're rolling 16 dice.

**[36:35]** Only a big ball of units is going to be able to withstand all the results

**[36:39]** that you have the potential of rolling here.

**[36:41]** Not too much else to say here other than, again, hunting horrors are expensive,

**[36:45]** so it feels very bad to lose them,

**[36:47]** so I would avoid overly relying on this ability.

**[36:51]** You have your accolades and your cheaper monsters to soak up those hits,

**[36:54]** so avoid applying them to your horrors because you want them to stick around

**[36:58]** so they can keep flying into subsequent battles and providing you more value.

**[37:04]** That's Spellbooks out of the way,

**[37:05]** so now we can move on to the opening strategies portion of the guide.

**[37:11]** In Action Phase 1 as Crawling Chaos,

**[37:14]** I feel like you've got several different openings that you can go for.

**[37:18]** First, I'll just talk about very standard opening,

**[37:21]** moving, building a Gate,

**[37:23]** then from there you can either summon some combination of

**[37:26]** a Night Gaunt plus a hunting horror at your Gates,

**[37:29]** or two flying polyps that's going to take up the remainder of your 4 Power.

**[37:33]** Kind of dependent on what Spellbooks you'd like to go for.

**[37:37]** If you go for the polyps, yeah, go for invisibility.

**[37:40]** If you go for the early hunting horror,

**[37:41]** maybe you want to take Seek and Destroy a bit earlier.

**[37:46]** Another opening I'm very fond of is the first action of the entire game,

**[37:51]** summon a Night Gaunt.

**[37:52]** Nobody can really hide from you with flight,

**[37:54]** you're always one or two moves away.

**[37:56]** Very easily with first action Night Gaunt,

**[37:59]** you can pressure people who are trying to build Gates.

**[38:03]** Somebody moves into an area attempting to build a Gate,

**[38:06]** and you fly your Night Gaunt in.

**[38:07]** They're either going to have to move and waste a Power,

**[38:09]** or they're going to build a Gate,

**[38:11]** and you're going to get a capture,

**[38:12]** which is going to get you a book,

**[38:14]** and maybe even get you an extra Gate.

**[38:15]** Good players probably are not going to get caught slipping by this,

**[38:18]** but a less experienced player,

**[38:20]** or a player trying to go for a greedy 3-Gate opening,

**[38:23]** is going to fall victim to this lone Night Gaunt.

**[38:27]** Rolling zero dice,

**[38:28]** but doing something very valuable by capturing an Acolyte early on.

**[38:31]** If you do manage to get away with that capture,

**[38:33]** you're really set up great for action phase 2,

**[38:36]** because you're probably going to have 11 Power,

**[38:38]** and that's enough to awaken your great old one,

**[38:40]** but also enough to probably activate thousand forms.

**[38:44]** In the last opening I want to mention,

**[38:46]** which I cannot fully, fully endorse,

**[38:49]** but dependent on the faction mix at the table,

**[38:51]** the 3-Gate opening is very much in play for this faction.

**[38:54]** With flight, you're going to be able to get to the remotest areas of the map,

**[38:57]** where people are not going to be able to easily move to you.

**[39:01]** Getting 3-Gates is incredibly strong as this faction,

**[39:04]** because it sets you up for awakening in action phase 2,

**[39:07]** plus doing a couple of other things.

**[39:09]** Highly recommend the 3-Gate opening if you can get away with it.

**[39:12]** However, you're going to be pinning a target on yourself early on,

**[39:15]** and hopefully the other players are not going to be united against you from that point on.

**[39:20]** The other players probably should be coming after you if you go for this opening.

**[39:24]** You're going to get your Spellbook requirement for having 3-Gates,

**[39:27]** and you're just going to have more Power than the other players,

**[39:29]** and it accelerates your game plan so much to have the extra Gate at the start of the game.

**[39:35]** In action phase 2, it's pretty rote,

**[39:38]** so unless something bad happened,

**[39:40]** you should be awakening Gnarlathotep like 99% of the time.

**[39:45]** He's so key to your strategy.

**[39:46]** You need this great old one out as soon as possible,

**[39:48]** so that you can start doing things in action phase 3 as soon as possible.

**[39:51]** If something bad did happen, so to give you an example, the classic game with the four base factions,

**[39:58]** Yellow Sign is not far from Crawling Chaos.

**[40:01]** They like to awaken the king in yellow in Arabia.

**[40:04]** It's totally possible for them to awaken the king, move into South Asia, and capture one of your acolytes.

**[40:09]** There's really nothing that you can do about that.

**[40:11]** In the event that you are on 8 or 9 Power in action phase 2,

**[40:16]** just be sure that you are going to build that third Gate and get a Spellbook,

**[40:21]** maybe even build a fourth Gate.

**[40:22]** Just ensure, at all costs in action phase 3,

**[40:26]** that you're going to be able to awaken your great old one.

**[40:29]** If you do anticipate some shenanigans in action phase 1,

**[40:32]** that you might not start action phase 2 on 10 Power,

**[40:35]** I would suggest, as your monsters in action phase 1,

**[40:38]** summoning two flying polyps.

**[40:40]** In action phase 2, if you can't awaken your great old one,

**[40:44]** you can still spend 1 Power to move, 3 Power for a Gate,

**[40:48]** and get that 3 Gate Spellbook.

**[40:50]** And there you can take invisibility.

**[40:52]** Then, as we've discussed, you've got two flying polyps.

**[40:55]** They can pretty much get anywhere they need to on the map

**[40:57]** and start preying on those lightly defended Gates.

**[41:00]** So, even if you forego Narlathotep in action phase 2,

**[41:04]** you might be able to snipe a Gate

**[41:06]** and possibly get that 4 Gates or 15 Power in action phase 2,

**[41:12]** and start the following action phase on 12 or 14 Power

**[41:16]** with plenty to awaken your great old one

**[41:18]** and keep doing other stuff.

**[41:20]** Last thing, as far as openings are concerned,

**[41:23]** thinking about the earliest Spellbooks you're going to want to take.

**[41:27]** Not necessarily in any particular order,

**[41:29]** but I would be taking Emissary of the Outer Gods and Thousand Forms first,

**[41:32]** like 95-99% of the time.

**[41:35]** Again, this is because you can't afford to lose Narlathotep,

**[41:38]** and the Thousand Forms is going to come in very, very handy

**[41:40]** if anybody's taking the turn off and not having a lot of Power.

**[41:44]** This is just possibly free Power for you,

**[41:46]** and you're going to want it because you do need to pay for your Spellbooks,

**[41:49]** which I would start considering doing that as early as action phase 3,

**[41:53]** particularly the 6-cost Spellbook.

**[41:55]** You want to get that out of the way,

**[41:57]** because it's going to just become more and more of a pain

**[41:59]** as the game goes on to pay for that book.

**[42:03]** We'll move on to general tips and tricks for playing Crawling Chaos.

**[42:07]** So, first thing, I've said it many times already,

**[42:10]** but your great old one is key to your strategy, central to your strategy.

**[42:13]** So, protecting Narlathotep at all costs is a great idea.

**[42:17]** This means on offense, do not be afraid to,

**[42:21]** once you get unlimited battle,

**[42:22]** spend 4 or 5 Power moving,

**[42:24]** bring in multiple bodies,

**[42:26]** just so that Narlathotep is definitely not going to get killed.

**[42:29]** This is worth doing every single time.

**[42:31]** If Narlathotep does get killed,

**[42:32]** you're really going to be in a bad spot,

**[42:34]** because none of your monsters are particularly strong.

**[42:37]** Spending that extra Power just to have the extra insurance in the battle

**[42:40]** is worth doing every time.

**[42:41]** You'll be thanking yourself later.

**[42:42]** Let's talk more about Train of Pain and sniping great old ones.

**[42:48]** With your Harbinger ability,

**[42:50]** you should be gunning for people's great old ones.

**[42:52]** If you're able to assassinate a bunch of great old ones,

**[42:55]** you're going to be really able to suppress the other players

**[42:57]** while you're playing the game with this faction,

**[43:00]** and just always be looking for spots where you can fly in and ruin them.

**[43:05]** Once you have unlimited combat, this becomes a lot easier.

**[43:08]** Try to engineer a situation in which you're around 20 doom,

**[43:11]** maybe you're in the low 20s.

**[43:13]** Fly in, fight, survive,

**[43:15]** maybe pain yourself into another area with another great old one,

**[43:19]** fight again with your unlimited combat,

**[43:21]** and be able to earn two or four or six Elder Signs

**[43:24]** and win from a doom count in the low 20s.

**[43:27]** Recall there are several factions,

**[43:29]** Windwalker, Yellow Sign,

**[43:30]** they have multiple great old ones.

**[43:32]** Demon Sultan, they have three great old ones.

**[43:34]** Crawling Chaos loves to fly in and fight with multiple great old ones

**[43:37]** in the same battle.

**[43:39]** You can manage to pain two great old ones,

**[43:40]** that's four Elder Signs at once.

**[43:42]** That's going to be easy five or six doom.

**[43:45]** That can end the game by itself.

**[43:47]** Even if you end up losing Gnarlaithotep,

**[43:48]** it doesn't matter if you've gained six doom

**[43:50]** and you're at 24 and the game's just over.

**[43:53]** Use your madness Spellbook as well.

**[43:55]** People are not going to want to have their great old ones isolated,

**[43:58]** but they're not going to really have any say over that

**[44:00]** if their great old ones get into a battle

**[44:02]** and you pain them where you want with madness.

**[44:04]** It's very easy to construct a situation in which you position their great old ones

**[44:09]** in the right spot for you to fly in and fight several times

**[44:12]** and get a handful of Elder Signs and just win the game,

**[44:16]** if not right on the spot in the action phase,

**[44:18]** but maybe in the following doom phase.

**[44:20]** So I've talked about kind of the best case scenario.

**[44:24]** I've been talking in a vacuum where people are not like working against you.

**[44:29]** What do you do if the other players are all against you?

**[44:32]** You've been the villain the entire game.

**[44:34]** What do you do?

**[44:35]** In that case,

**[44:36]** I would just be positioning Gnarlaithotep into an area

**[44:40]** where you have a bunch of your cheap units,

**[44:41]** like multiple night guns,

**[44:43]** multiple acolytes,

**[44:44]** things that you don't mind losing in a battle

**[44:46]** if somebody comes and fights you.

**[44:48]** They're inexpensive to recruit.

**[44:50]** This is another place where the flying polyps come in very, very handy.

**[44:53]** If everyone's scheming and talking amongst themselves

**[44:56]** on how they're going to kill Gnarlaithotep,

**[44:58]** place Gnarlaithotep into an area that has one or two polyps

**[45:02]** and, you know, a couple acolytes and a couple of night gaunts.

**[45:06]** It's going to take a lot for somebody to move in

**[45:08]** and actually be able to kill you.

**[45:10]** You're going to exempt the monsters rolling the most dice

**[45:12]** and it's going to put them at risk too

**[45:14]** of your harbinger ability.

**[45:17]** Just don't let Gnarlaithotep get caught out in the open

**[45:20]** once the other factions have their unlimited combat

**[45:22]** if they're against you.

**[45:24]** Try to make sure Gnarlaithotep always has an entourage

**[45:27]** of other Crawling Chaos units around him

**[45:29]** and you'll be pretty set up for success.

**[45:33]** One more point on being on the defensive as Crawling Chaos.

**[45:37]** Obviously, you want to protect Gnarlaithotep.

**[45:39]** Your random other Gates,

**[45:41]** one acolyte,

**[45:43]** one night gaunt,

**[45:44]** one flying polyp,

**[45:46]** is actually a pretty well defended Gate.

**[45:48]** As we said earlier,

**[45:50]** no single monster is going to be able to threaten that Gate at all.

**[45:53]** They're going to need to come in with multiple monsters

**[45:56]** and or their great old one

**[45:58]** in order to actually take that Gate from you.

**[46:00]** And that's just kind of playing into your hands

**[46:02]** because you just want to have as many bodies in the battle

**[46:05]** as possible on your side.

**[46:06]** And if you have a couple Gates on the map

**[46:08]** that just have one or two acolytes

**[46:10]** plus a night gaunt

**[46:11]** plus a flying polyp,

**[46:12]** you've already got great spots for Gnarlaithotep to come back to rest.

**[46:17]** If anybody comes to those spots,

**[46:19]** you're going to have the advantage as the attacker or the defender in that battle.

**[46:25]** How to thwart Crawling Chaos.

**[46:28]** In case it's not clear,

**[46:29]** this is a very social faction as I've mentioned multiple times.

**[46:32]** So the best way to do this is just get the other players in your corner.

**[46:35]** Get everybody on the same page.

**[46:37]** Crawling Chaos is the enemy.

**[46:39]** They need to be stopped.

**[46:40]** We need to pay for every thousand forms no matter how much it costs.

**[46:43]** We need to put our differences aside.

**[46:45]** Go after Crawling Chaos Gates.

**[46:47]** Fight Crawling Chaos even if it's at our own expense

**[46:50]** just to isolate Gnarlaithotep so that another player can come in and kill him.

**[46:55]** If you manage to kill Gnarlaithotep,

**[46:57]** Crawling Chaos really falls apart.

**[46:59]** Their units are not strong.

**[47:00]** Some of their monsters can't even declare combat.

**[47:02]** They're not going to be a threat if you can eliminate their great old one.

**[47:06]** In addition, another juicy target would be those hunting horrors.

**[47:09]** If you can ever find them out of position where they're not in the area with Gnarlaithotep,

**[47:14]** they can be worth fighting even if there's no Gate in the area.

**[47:17]** If you're able to kill one or more of the horrors,

**[47:19]** that is a significant expense to Crawling Chaos.

**[47:21]** They're not going to want to have to pay

**[47:23]** 3 or 6 Power to awaken those horrors again

**[47:26]** because every Power counts to this faction.

**[47:29]** Anytime you're going to be able to make them like quote unquote

**[47:31]** waste Power, resummoning their expensive units,

**[47:34]** that is a win for you and your alliance against the Crawling Chaos.

**[47:40]** And all of that said, I think this has been another episode of opening the way in the books.

**[47:46]** I hope you enjoyed.

**[47:48]** I hope I've done justice to one of these classic factions.

**[47:52]** Not my favorite faction, but I do enjoy this one quite a bit.

**[47:55]** I'm not the best Crawling Chaos player in the world, but certainly not the worst.

**[47:59]** So I hope you found this informative and I hope you found this useful.

**[48:03]** A reminder to join the Cthulhu Wars Discord and you can find me on Discord at Kilogram.

**[48:09]** Please send me a message or message me on the Cthulhu Wars Discord itself.

**[48:13]** I'd love to meet up with you and play a game sometime.

**[48:17]** Until then, have a nice day, have a nice evening,

**[48:20]** have a nice morning, wherever it is that you are.

**[48:23]** Thanks. Bye.
