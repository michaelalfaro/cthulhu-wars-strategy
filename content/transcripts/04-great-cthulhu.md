## Transcript

**[00:00]** The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study,

**[00:06]** was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship.

**[00:12]** It represented a monster of a vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose

**[00:17]** face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet,

**[00:24]** and long, narrowing wings behind.

**[00:27]** This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat

**[00:33]** bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with

**[00:38]** undecipherable characters.

**[00:40]** The tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the center

**[00:44]** whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped the front edge

**[00:49]** and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of the pedestal.

**[00:53]** The cephalopod head was bent forward so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the

**[00:58]** backs of huge forepaws which clasped the croucher's elevated knees.

**[01:03]** The aspect of the whole was abnormally lifelike, and the more subtly fearful because its source

**[01:08]** was so totally unknown.

**[01:10]** Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was unmistakable, yet not one link did it show

**[01:16]** with any known type of art belonging to civilization's youth, or indeed to any other time.

**[01:22]** Equally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery, for the soapy, greenish-black

**[01:27]** stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar

**[01:32]** to geology or mineralogy.

**[01:35]** Characters along the base were equally baffling, and no member present, despite a representation

**[01:40]** of half the world's expert learning in this field, could form the least notion of even

**[01:44]** their remotest linguistic kinship.

**[01:46]** They, like the subject and material, belonged to something horribly remote and distinct

**[01:51]** from mankind as we know it, something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of

**[01:56]** life in which our world and our conceptions have no part.

**[02:01]** Hello, welcome to Opening the Way, I'm Graham, I'm your host.

**[02:24]** What you heard there in the intro was an excerpt from The Call of Cthulhu, that's the Lovecraft

**[02:30]** story published in 1928, that's describing an idol, basically is also describing the

**[02:37]** shape of the Great Old One and faction that we are going to cover today, and that is Great

**[02:43]** Cthulhu.

**[02:44]** I'm really excited about this one, Great Cthulhu is the mascot of Cthulhu Wars, I mean, can't

**[02:52]** spell Cthulhu Wars without Cthulhu.

**[02:55]** It's one of the first four factions, one of my favorite factions, one of the first

**[03:00]** factions that I felt like I was actually any good with.

**[03:05]** Let me read a little bit of a thought from someone in the community, Yith, shout out

**[03:11]** to Yith, hope your planet apocalypse is going well.

**[03:15]** Great Cthulhu is a solid faction that works great as an introductory to the game with

**[03:19]** a straightforward playstyle of being the one who beats up the other factions, especially

**[03:24]** the one winning, and doesn't care as much about getting hit back, especially with Cthulhu

**[03:29]** himself.

**[03:30]** Yeah, I totally agree with that.

**[03:32]** Cthulhu is one of the most interactive factions in the game, one of the most policing factions

**[03:38]** of the game.

**[03:39]** It's very good at keeping the other factions in check, particularly the factions that,

**[03:46]** if left alone, like Cho-Cho, will completely run away with the game.

**[03:52]** So yeah, Cthulhu is a brawler.

**[03:55]** He likes to get into direct fights with the other factions, and usually has the tools

**[04:01]** to come out on top.

**[04:03]** There's a couple other combat factions that can rival Cthulhu in terms of the raw dice

**[04:09]** that they can roll, but we can talk about that later.

**[04:13]** We're just right now just basking in the warm glow that is Cthulhu's love.

**[04:19]** So those were kind of my opening thoughts.

**[04:20]** I'm going to go into the faction overview now.

**[04:24]** So for setup, that's pretty straightforward.

**[04:27]** Cthulhu always sets up in the South Pacific Ocean.

**[04:32]** Why South Pacific?

**[04:34]** If you read over these stories, you'll know the South Pacific is roughly where Relier,

**[04:40]** the city that Cthulhu is trying to raise up from the depths, that's where it is.

**[04:44]** Now let's talk about the unique faction ability that's immortal.

**[04:50]** To help you understand immortal, I'm going to read you another little excerpt from The

**[04:54]** Call of Cthulhu.

**[04:55]** The awful squid head with writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy

**[05:00]** yacht but Johansen drove on relentlessly.

**[05:03]** There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish,

**[05:10]** a stench of a thousand open graves, and a sound that the chronicler would not put on

**[05:14]** paper.

**[05:15]** For an instant, the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud.

**[05:20]** Then there was only a venomous seething astern where, God in heaven, the scattered plasticity

**[05:25]** of the nameless skyspawn was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form.

**[05:31]** Yeah, so that's just a little bit of the story.

**[05:35]** No spoilers, but you've had almost a hundred years to read this one.

**[05:39]** What you should know about Cthulhu is he's great at coming back after the first time

**[05:45]** he's summoned.

**[05:47]** The first time you summon Cthulhu, it costs you ten Power, but Immortal says once Cthulhu

**[05:52]** has awakened, he costs only four Power each additional time he's awakened.

**[05:57]** Whenever you awaken any Great Old One, gain one Elder Sign.

**[06:01]** So every time you awaken Cthulhu, including the first time, you're getting an Elder Sign.

**[06:06]** If you happen to be playing with independent Great Old Ones, you're also going to be getting

**[06:11]** an Elder Sign for every time you wake up any Great Old One, which is a really cool

**[06:15]** bonus.

**[06:16]** I'm not sure I've even taken advantage of too many times, but it's there.

**[06:20]** This ability is really, really nice, a really, really nice way to keep your doom tempo going.

**[06:27]** It's a really nice way to be able to potentially close out the game during the action phase.

**[06:34]** After the doom phase, if you're at 27, 28 doom and you've got 12 Power, well, it's not

**[06:40]** too difficult to get into a couple of fights and awaken Cthulhu twice.

**[06:45]** That would cost you around 10, 9, 10, 11 Power, depending on where people are located.

**[06:50]** You can easily get two to four Elder Signs in one doom phase with this ability.

**[06:56]** But buyer beware, Dakuboto from Discord also had this to say on Immortal that I really

**[07:01]** liked.

**[07:02]** I'd say although Immortal's a great ability, I'd avoid purposely getting Cthulhu killed

**[07:06]** and resurrecting him repeatedly for Elder Signs.

**[07:09]** Four Power is a lot for 1.67 doom points, so think of it more as an extra benefit rather

**[07:16]** as your winning strategy.

**[07:18]** Love that.

**[07:19]** Totally agree.

**[07:20]** Cthulhu is a brawler.

**[07:22]** Cthulhu is meant to check whoever is really getting out of control.

**[07:26]** You can't make getting Cthulhu killed on purpose your main plan.

**[07:30]** It's definitely a good plan B or even a plan C, but should not be your main way to score.

**[07:37]** Let's talk about the Spellbook requirements for Cthulhu.

**[07:40]** Yeah, this one's actually very easy.

**[07:44]** You could say Cthulhu only really has three objectives to complete, and that's because

**[07:49]** your first Spellbook in the first doom phase, you receive it for free, you also get an Elder

**[07:54]** Sign for free.

**[07:55]** Amazing.

**[07:56]** You have another Spellbook that says in the doom phase in which you've achieved five other

**[08:02]** Spellbooks on this card, receive this Spellbook, also receive one Elder Sign.

**[08:07]** So you're getting three free Elder Signs.

**[08:11]** Say that five times fast.

**[08:13]** Every game that you play as Great Cthulhu, well, every game that you plan to get six

**[08:16]** books and win anyway, you're getting one for that first one, that's free, your sixth Spellbook

**[08:22]** is also free, and whenever you wake in Cthulhu because of your Immortal ability, you are

**[08:27]** also getting another Elder Sign.

**[08:29]** You're getting, let's see, 1.67 times three, something out of doom.

**[08:34]** You're getting three free Elder Signs.

**[08:37]** I can't really say that any faster than that.

**[08:40]** Only really having three objectives to do is really, really nice, so maybe we should

**[08:44]** discuss the other three.

**[08:46]** Control three Gates in Odin.

**[08:48]** or sea areas, or four Gates exist in ocean or sea areas. You're already

**[08:54]** starting out the game with one on the map that's in the South Pacific.

**[08:57]** Hopefully in the first action phase you're going to be building a second

**[09:01]** Gate in the ocean. We'll talk more about the openings later. But yeah, you're only

**[09:05]** really going to need to build the third Gate in the ocean. It's the only time

**[09:10]** you're really going to go out of your way. If the other players are savvy,

**[09:13]** they're not going to build a Gate in the water for any reason. Maybe you can

**[09:18]** trick somebody who's new or something, but anybody who knows what's going on,

**[09:22]** they're not going to build that third Gate for you. Maybe there's some crazy

**[09:27]** game where Wind Walker weirdly wants to start in the Arctic Ocean and give you a

**[09:32]** Gate for political reasons. Great. But mostly you're gonna have to build that

**[09:39]** third one yourself. So no big deal. Gates only cost three. You've got a good way of

**[09:43]** holding on to Gates. We can talk a little bit about one of Cthulhu's other

**[09:47]** Spellbooks here in a minute. Let's go over the other two book requirements.

**[09:51]** They're very interrelated. One of them is kill or devour an enemy unit in battle,

**[09:57]** and then the second one is kill or devour two enemy units in battle. And

**[10:01]** there's also a little rider here that says you may earn both these Spellbooks

**[10:05]** in a single battle if you kill and or devour three or more units. Okay, so

**[10:11]** Cthulhu is a brawler. Quite literally you cannot win as Cthulhu unless you fight

**[10:15]** at least one time. I'm always usually trying to angle for the three kills in

**[10:21]** one battle because it's the most efficient, saves you the most amount of

**[10:25]** Power, but you know, if you have to do it, you know, two times, it is what it is.

**[10:31]** So realistically, maybe we can talk quickly about when you can get these

**[10:35]** Spellbooks, when you can get online all six Spellbooks as Cthulhu. Pretty fast

**[10:40]** actually. You're not going to get it in action phase two. Possibly by the end of

**[10:44]** action phase three you will have made that third ocean Gate, or you've met the

**[10:49]** four Gate requirement, and you will have fought and killed at least three units.

**[10:54]** If you can do that, you're already starting the fourth action phase with

**[10:58]** all six of your books and unlimited combat, which is a huge game-changer for

**[11:03]** Cthulhu. For the next part of this guide, we're gonna go over the units for Great

**[11:08]** Cthulhu. I'm gonna mention some Spellbooks here, but kind of surface

**[11:12]** level mention them, go into more detail on them in a second. Like any other

**[11:17]** faction, you've got six acolytes that you start with. The Cthulhu unique

**[11:21]** acolytes, they look like little guys with raincoats on, maybe slightly resembling

**[11:28]** Sandy Peterson. Anyway, they look like denizens of Innsmouth. That's not a

**[11:33]** coincidence. You should probably read The Shadow of Innsmouth if you want to know

**[11:38]** more why that is. One book that works with your acolytes is Devolve. It's

**[11:43]** really, really nice. At the end of any player's action, even if it's not your

**[11:46]** turn, you can transform one or more of your acolytes anywhere on the map into

**[11:51]** Deep Ones. So, great segue. We're talking about Deep Ones. That's the first monster

**[11:56]** that Cthulhu has. They cost one Power to summon, and they roll one dice. Deep Ones

**[12:03]** are not that useful, but they are cheap, and they do represent a one-cost action

**[12:10]** that you can take. If you listen to my Intermediate Advanced How to Play

**[12:15]** episode, you'll know taking one-cost actions is kind of what you want to be

**[12:19]** doing. One of the ways that you can spend Power as slowly as possible. So, Cthulhu

**[12:24]** has a way of summoning a monster that's one-cost action. You will also be

**[12:30]** transforming your acolytes back into your pool. That will give you another

**[12:34]** one-cost action. So, nice way to stall. The next monster is a Shoggoth. They cost

**[12:41]** two Power to summon, and they've got two combat. They kind of look a little bit

**[12:47]** like a nasty wave covered in eyes. I really love the way of this sculpt. The

**[12:54]** Spellbook that works with the Shoggoth is Absorb. While Shoggoths present,

**[12:59]** eliminate one or more of your monsters or Cultists from the area. For each unit

**[13:04]** removed, add three dice to the Shoggoth's combat for the battle. That can be pretty

**[13:09]** scary. Talk more about Absorb shortly. The last monster for Cthulhu is the

**[13:15]** Starspawn. They cost three Power to summon, and they have three combat dice.

**[13:21]** And the Spellbook that works with the Starspawn is Regenerate. Apply up to two

**[13:26]** battle results to the same Starspawn when taking losses. If both results are

**[13:31]** kills, the Starspawn dies. On any other combination of kills or pain results, the

**[13:36]** Starspawn retreats. Yeah, so Starspawn, they're kind of like their dad, Cthulhu.

**[13:41]** They're like his kids. They like getting in fights too. They're not afraid of a

**[13:45]** fight at all, and they can usually walk away from most small battles with

**[13:50]** Cthulhu. Let's talk about Cthulhu himself. Cthulhu costs ten Power to awaken,

**[13:57]** asterisk, the first time. Every other time, like we discussed with Immortal, he only

**[14:03]** costs four Power to awaken. You need to have a Gate in the South Pacific in

**[14:08]** order to awaken Cthulhu. You don't need to control it. Yeah, there does need to be a

**[14:13]** Gate there. That is something we can talk a little bit more later when we talk

**[14:16]** about thwarting this faction. So Cthulhu costs usually four Power first time, ten

**[14:22]** Power, six combat dice. He also has an ability which I mentioned several times

**[14:28]** earlier, Devour. It's pre-battle ability. The enemy player eliminates one of their

**[14:34]** monsters or Cultists from the battle of their choice. So this is a great way to

**[14:38]** get those books. You don't even need to roll any kills in the battle. The first

**[14:43]** unit you devour, it's gonna get you a book. In the subsequent battle, if you do

**[14:47]** need to fight multiple battles, you only need to roll a single kill to get your

**[14:51]** other book, so that's really nice. But yeah, like I was saying earlier, we really

**[14:56]** do want to get both those books in a single fight if possible. The spell book

**[15:02]** that works with Great Cthulhu is Submerge. It's a one-cost action. If Cthulhu is in

**[15:08]** an ocean or sea area, you move him from the map and place him on your faction

**[15:12]** card along with any or all of your units in the area. Later, as a zero-cost action,

**[15:17]** you may place Cthulhu plus all accompanying units into any area. So can

**[15:23]** only submerge from an ocean area, you can pop up in any area, including landlocked

**[15:29]** areas. This is a big game. I'll talk more about why that is. Okay, I'm gonna go over

**[15:35]** the spell books for Cthulhu now. Yonathle. Ongoing. During Gather Power, if

**[15:42]** Cthulhu is in play, you gain one Power for each enemy controlled Gate in an

**[15:46]** ocean area. That means even if you don't hold on to your Gates in the ocean for

**[15:52]** whatever reason, you're gonna get one Power back. So the more Gates there are

**[15:55]** in the ocean, the more people are fighting in the ocean. It still benefits

**[16:00]** you, but I think like I said earlier in the episode, if you're playing with

**[16:04]** experienced players, they're gonna go out of their way to not build Gates in the

**[16:09]** ocean if at all possible. Maybe you've got somebody in the game like Opener or

**[16:14]** Sleeper or a Demon Sultan that is doing shenanigans and either moving Gates

**[16:21]** around or building chaos Gates on the cheap in the ocean. That's great for you,

**[16:26]** but know that most people are not gonna do that on purpose unless they're

**[16:32]** trying to like do something political and be your friend in order to not get

**[16:36]** punched. That's a great idea, but the bill will come due someday. Another spell

**[16:42]** book here, we've got Dreams. It's a two-cost action. Choose an area

**[16:47]** containing an enemy acolyte's Cultist. Your enemy must eliminate one of their

**[16:51]** acolyte Cultists from that area and replace it with one from your pool. This

**[16:55]** is a very nice ability, fairly nice way of stealing Gates from people. Assuming

**[17:02]** they only have a single acolyte on the Gate, you can pay two Power to steal a

**[17:07]** Gate from somebody who has run out of Power. Managing this ability is really

**[17:13]** really key. It kind of all works together with Absorb and Devolve. I'll come back

**[17:19]** to that, those in concert together later, but know that if you can keep an acolyte

**[17:24]** in your pool and two Power up, this is a great way of like stealing Gates without

**[17:28]** having to move to them. If you're playing in a game with experienced players,

**[17:32]** they're probably gonna try to play around Dreams and the...

**[17:36]** to do that is by having more than one acolyte on your Gates. Just like most abilities in

**[17:41]** Cthulhu Wars, the person on the receiving end gets to choose. So in the event they have two acolytes,

**[17:47]** one on the Gate, one off the Gate in an area, they'll choose the one that's off the Gate.

**[17:51]** So it would really cost you four Power worth of dreams to take that Gate. You'll also note,

**[17:56]** you know, dreams, it only works if you have acolytes in your pool. Really, really important

**[18:01]** with this faction to manage the amount of acolytes you have on the map versus in your pool. If you

**[18:08]** have all your acolytes out, dreams is not doing anything, but that's a great way to segue back

**[18:13]** into the spell books to talk a little bit in more detail about them. So how about devolve?

**[18:18]** We talked about that earlier. Between people's actions, you can transform any of your acolytes

**[18:24]** into Deep Ones. This is one of the only, if you'll pardon me using a magic expression,

**[18:29]** this is one of the only instant speed abilities in Cthulhu Wars. Most things I would call

**[18:34]** sorcery speed, and I mean to say like you can't really interrupt somebody or do something to

**[18:40]** react to what somebody may be planning to do. With devolve, you can. So basically this ability

**[18:46]** means that Cthulhu is very, very good at guarding their own Gates. So just to give you an example,

**[18:53]** let's say you're going to go fight with Cthulhu somewhere else. You submerge and you bring all

**[18:59]** of your units with you. You could leave back a Shoggoth or a Starspawn or a Deep One and an

**[19:06]** acolyte to, you know, control the Gate and guard the Gate. You don't really need to do that a lot

**[19:11]** of the time. If you just leave a single acolyte there and nothing else, well, if anybody moves

**[19:17]** in to try to capture you, before anybody really gets a chance to do that, you'll have the opportunity

**[19:22]** to devolve. So not only will you devolve into a monster and deny them the capture, if you feel

**[19:27]** like the next time you get to take an action, you can just recruit an acolyte back for one Power on

**[19:33]** that same Gate. Now you have an acolyte there with a monster guarding it and somebody wasted Power

**[19:39]** walking into your area to try to take your Gate, and now they can't. Not without battling you,

**[19:44]** of course. So yeah, devolve is very spicy. Just be careful about the amount of Deep Ones that you end

**[19:51]** up getting out. Similarly to our conundrum with dreams, devolve only works if you have Deep Ones

**[19:59]** in your pool. You've got four of them, so you've got to be really careful about don't get into a

**[20:05]** situation where you have all four Deep Ones on the map and you're going to need to devolve because

**[20:11]** you're not going to be able to do it at the time you need to. So again, Deep Ones and acolytes are

**[20:16]** units that we need to be managing carefully if we're going to be successful. Which ones are on

**[20:21]** the map and how many, and the ones in our pool. How do we make sure that acolytes and Deep Ones

**[20:28]** are returning to our pool so that we can keep using dreams and keep using devolve? That brings

**[20:32]** us back around to absorb. If we've got a Shoggoth in the battle, we can munch up as many of our

**[20:39]** other units as we want, and we get three additional combat dice for the battle. First and foremost,

**[20:45]** absorb is a great way to break a defensive line. If somebody is playing one of the more defensive

**[20:52]** factions, let's say it's a chocho trying to just turtle up and do their thing. That would be one

**[20:59]** example. Maybe an early sleeper player is just stacking all their units in North America. They're

**[21:06]** not going out and doing anything. They're waiting until they can sleep and go do something when

**[21:11]** everyone's out of Power. Absorb will let you actually just like crack through that defensive

**[21:17]** wall in a way that not many other abilities can. So let's do some fun quick math here.

**[21:25]** Say we've got a ball of units. We've got Cthulhu we're going to submerge. We bring one Shoggoth.

**[21:31]** We could bring up to six acolytes with us potentially and four Deep Ones. If we were to

**[21:36]** eat all those things, that's 10 units. That's up to 30 dice that the Deep One can roll. 10 times 3

**[21:43]** plus the dice from Cthulhu. That's 36 dice. You could roll potentially like 38 dice. I mean you're

**[21:49]** not really going to ever do that because you're going to want to have some amount of Gates, but

**[21:53]** I've seen and done pretty regularly if you're doing good absorb play, you can roll

**[22:01]** over 20 dice 24-25 dice like pretty easily while maintaining other Gates on the map. That's kind of

**[22:07]** the sweet spot. You're going to get the job done in most battles doing that. Again you might be

**[22:11]** able to not be able to like wipe everything out from these defensive walls, but you will

**[22:18]** kill a chunk of units probably and you're going to paint out everything else most likely.

**[22:23]** So yeah absorb is a great way to throw the kitchen sink at somebody who's not trying to

**[22:30]** expose themselves in any way to getting attacked. You can kind of ignore that with absorb. The other

**[22:37]** thing about absorb that I've been alluding to is kind of the way that these three Spellbooks work

**[22:42]** in concert with each other. Absorb, dreams, and devolve. I was telling my friend the other day who's

**[22:48]** just learning to play, this is like sort of like the rain cycle. If you can get really good at

**[22:53]** managing this, you can constantly have a flow of eating things to absorb, throwing a lot of dice in

**[22:58]** the battle later, devolving when you need to, or dreamsing Gates that people have been slipping and

**[23:06]** only leave one acolyte to guard that Gate. It can be very very effective if you're doing it right.

**[23:11]** Keep that in mind. The flow of your units is very important. One thing you don't want to do

**[23:17]** is leave your... you don't really want to ever leave your units on land as Cthulhu if you can

**[23:24]** help it. Especially not Deep Ones because they're going to be more trickier to get into battles and

**[23:30]** absorb if they're just on land hanging out. Maybe there's not even a Gate there anymore. That's the

**[23:35]** worst case scenario. You're going to want to get that Deep One back in the water as soon as possible.

**[23:41]** Okay so now at this point we've been through, decently talked in detail about the units, the

**[23:49]** faction overview, all the things the faction is capable of, and all the spell books. Now I think

**[23:55]** we can probably talk a little bit about playing Cthulhu, talk about some of the openings that we

**[24:00]** can go for, and sort of like how to be good with this one and then how to fight against it.

**[24:06]** Let's talk about openings. If you've listened to my episode on how to play and getting good, you're

**[24:13]** going to know that in action phase one, all factions you have the ability to make a Gate

**[24:21]** and guard that Gate, both your starting Gate and the new Gate, with a monster. So that's completely

**[24:26]** true for Cthulhu as well. One Power, move. Three Power, make a Gate. You should probably be building an

**[24:32]** ocean Gate. If somebody doesn't do that, I strongly question it because you're working against your

**[24:40]** spell books. People aren't going to build those Gates in the ocean like I said, unless they're

**[24:44]** trying to do you a favor, they're going to avoid that. So recommend building an ocean Gate and then

**[24:50]** after that you can then do some combination of Deep One at the Gate that you just built, and then

**[24:57]** you have enough to do a star spawn at your starting Gate. You could also do some kind of fancy

**[25:04]** combination of Deep One at the new Gate and then a Deep One and then a Shoggoth at your starting

**[25:10]** Gate. Maybe you want to go for some absorb play. That's a good way to set yourself up to use absorb

**[25:17]** a little later. Of course the other thing you can do if you listen to the episode about how to play

**[25:21]** is the greedy opening, the double Gate opening. Yeah, definitely a thing in Cthulhu. Make sure

**[25:27]** you do it in the ocean so that you get your spell book. If you do that in the first action phase,

**[25:34]** control three Gates in the ocean, probably should take devolve. If you're playing with good players,

**[25:39]** they're not going to let you do this. They're going to come over and try to capture you.

**[25:42]** Rather than let them do that, you might just want to devolve. Depending on the Power they have,

**[25:47]** I don't know, not great. I wouldn't recommend going for this strategy unless you can talk

**[25:54]** somebody into it. Maybe you and Crawling Chaos are playing, and I'll talk about the fraught

**[25:59]** relationship with Crawling Chaos a little bit more later, but suppose you and Crawling Chaos are

**[26:04]** playing, you're the only ones with Power, and you say, hey Crawling Chaos, what if we just both go

**[26:08]** for three Gates? I've had people agree to that before, so not impossible to go for this opening,

**[26:13]** but wouldn't recommend it blindly without trying to butter somebody up to not stop you from doing

**[26:20]** that because it's pretty easy to disrupt. Are there any...

**[26:24]** more interesting action phase one openings with Cthulhu? Not really. If you

**[26:30]** want to be like spicy, cool guy, maybe you can just get, you know, depending on where

**[26:36]** people are positioned, maybe you can get a Deep One as one of your first actions

**[26:42]** and start going trying to harass somebody's Gate. Don't really recommend

**[26:46]** that. I feel like you'd be spending more Power than it would be worth unless your

**[26:50]** Deep Ones are amazing and feisty and rolling a kill in every battle. Not

**[26:55]** really worth going for that. So mainly those are the three openings. I'll maybe

**[27:00]** talk in more detail about this in a High Priest episode, but just quickly, if you

**[27:04]** are playing with High Priest, in my opinion there's only really one

**[27:07]** opening to go for at that point. That would be you got your eight starting

**[27:11]** Power, spend one, move into an ocean area and build a Gate. You'll be on four Power

**[27:16]** after that, but you can then summon a Deep One to guard your ocean Gate, the one

**[27:22]** you just built, and then summon a High Priest in your starting area, or recruit

**[27:26]** a High Priest rather. Doing this is really awesome. Nobody can really punish

**[27:31]** you for this. Even if they come over and capture you in South Pacific because you

**[27:37]** don't have a monster there, you're still gonna start with at least ten Power.

**[27:41]** You'll have that extra High Priest generating one Power for you on gather

**[27:45]** Power, so even if you get captured once, you're still starting on ten Power, so

**[27:50]** you'll have enough for Cthulhu. You also have even enough to pop your High

**[27:56]** Priest in Action Phase 2 and do a couple things. But getting ahead of myself, I'll

**[28:02]** save that really for a High Priest episode. Now we've gone over our

**[28:06]** AP1 openings, let's talk about Action Phase 2. Well, there's really only two

**[28:13]** things to do here, if you ask me. So first thing one would be awaken Cthulhu. You

**[28:18]** probably should be doing this like 80% of the time, unless some shenanigans

**[28:23]** happened in Action Phase 1. You're gonna have two Gates, you're gonna have six

**[28:29]** accolades, that's gonna be ten Power exactly. That's enough to awaken Cthulhu.

**[28:33]** Totally reasonable thing to do. You'll get an Elder Sign there, you'll also get a

**[28:38]** Spellbook. I'm gonna say 99% of the time you should be taking Submerge. Don't try

**[28:43]** to get cute and not take Submerge. I've seen it happen. It can be very

**[28:48]** embarrassing when you think that you're too smart and you don't take Submerge.

**[28:52]** Trust me, just take Submerge. You'll be glad you did. So that's a

**[28:56]** pretty simple opening. You're gonna just spend all your Power doing that, and

**[29:00]** great, you'll be setting yourself up for AP3 where you can go fight a couple

**[29:05]** times, maybe only once, build your Gate, and then you're off to the races. So what

**[29:09]** else can you do if you don't summon Cthulhu? This is if somebody did

**[29:12]** something, somebody disrupted your play in Action Phase 1, or maybe

**[29:17]** Sleeper's in the game and somehow goes before you and Sleeper uses their

**[29:21]** Spellbook. Pay three, everybody loses a Power. Well, dang, now you're only at nine

**[29:26]** Power. You won't be able to summon Cthulhu. If that's the case, if you don't

**[29:30]** have ten Power, I would go for this play instead where you move and make a Gate.

**[29:35]** So let's say we're at nine Power. We move, we're at eight Power, make a Gate,

**[29:40]** we're at five Power. Then we've got some Power left over to play with, and we will

**[29:45]** have gotten our Control 3 Gates book. At this point, I take Dreams, and that's

**[29:51]** because we get a Spellbook in the first Doom Phase, we will probably take Devolve.

**[29:58]** We've got Devolve and Dreams set up. That means the other players at the table, if

**[30:02]** they're not careful, they're gonna have, maybe they awoke their own great old

**[30:07]** ones or something, they don't have a lot of Power left to play with. We've got five

**[30:11]** Power left after making our third Ocean Gate, so we actually have the potential

**[30:15]** to Dreams twice in the second Action Phase if we don't get Great Cthulhu. So

**[30:20]** that is an option. You may only be able to snipe one Gate there, but that's fine.

**[30:24]** You'll still have three Gates and three acolytes hopefully in the following

**[30:28]** Doom Phase, or following Action Phase, you'll start with 12 Power. So great way

**[30:33]** to start the third Action Phase strong if things get disrupted in Action Phase

**[30:38]** 1. I think I mentioned this earlier in the episode, but ideally in Action Phase

**[30:43]** 3, that's when we're gonna want to build our Gate and get into those fights. If

**[30:48]** things are going really well and you're playing this faction by Action Phase 4,

**[30:53]** you're gonna have all of your books after the Doom Phase. If you do, you're

**[30:57]** gonna have unlimited combat, and as I stated earlier, that is a huge game

**[31:02]** changer for Cthulhu. It makes Cthulhu go from like a little bit scary, don't want

**[31:06]** to fight them, to like, oh man, like Cthulhu's just submerged and you don't

**[31:11]** know what's gonna happen. You're like pleading with them not to come after

**[31:14]** your Gates after they submerge. Yeah, unlimited combat is so, so scary with

**[31:19]** Submerge because as soon as Cthulhu pops back up for zero Power, let me

**[31:24]** remind you, the second part of Submerge, they pop up for zero Power and then they

**[31:29]** can immediately declare combat against you. One of your things is getting eaten,

**[31:33]** they might have Absorb, they might be rolling a thousand dice, they might have

**[31:38]** a Death Ball with a couple of Star Spawn in there. If they do, you better be coming

**[31:43]** correct yourself in combat or just have a bunch of units there and hope your

**[31:48]** great old one doesn't get killed because yeah, Cthulhu is a force once they have

**[31:53]** unlimited combat. For the next part of the guide, I'm going to talk a little bit

**[31:56]** about playing Cthulhu, some of the like tactics that you can go for. So you've

**[32:00]** got that unlimited combat, we've talked a little bit about managing your Acolyte

**[32:05]** Count, your Deep One Count, the Rain Cycle. Let's talk about some of the different

**[32:10]** like formations, maybe you could call it. So let's talk about the Star Spawn. The

**[32:16]** Star Spawn, when they have Regenerate, they're very beefy once they have that.

**[32:21]** They soak up a kill before they get killed. So one good formation that you can

**[32:26]** have is just simply Cthulhu and two Star Spawn submerging and then unsubmerging

**[32:33]** and fighting. Pretty decent amount of dice there. You're rolling 12 dice plus a

**[32:37]** Devourer and you're soaking up two kills. So they're going to have to have like

**[32:42]** significant defenses to really be able to like punch you away and make you stay

**[32:46]** away. So this is like a nice small targeted strike force. Maybe a good

**[32:53]** situation to if you want to set yourself up to maybe awaken one time during the

**[32:57]** action phase and get an Elder Sign. This is a small force. If you do get a couple

**[33:02]** kills assigned, you can put one of them on Cthulhu and then a couple on the Star

**[33:05]** Spawn and they themselves won't get killed. Another formation we can go with

**[33:10]** is the Absorb Ball, if you will. That's going to be probably only one Shoggoth.

**[33:17]** Not really useful to have two Shoggoths. Yeah, one Shoggoth and kind of as many

**[33:22]** Deep Ones and Acolytes as you can carry. You don't really want to have multiple

**[33:26]** Acolytes on Gates if you can help it. I mean you can, of course. It makes it

**[33:30]** harder for people to capture you away from your Gates. But if you want to be

**[33:34]** throwing as many dice as possible with this tactic. So you're going to be

**[33:38]** submerging. You're going to pop up. You're going to eat. If you can eat three,

**[33:42]** even three units, that's two from the Shoggoth plus three times three from the

**[33:48]** units you ate. It's 11 dice from the Shoggoth, six from Cthulhu. That's 17

**[33:52]** dice. That's going to kill, you know, any small band of like a few units and a

**[33:58]** great old one. Probably going to die to that. Something's getting devoured.

**[34:01]** Something's going to die. If you really want to throw the Kitchen Sink at

**[34:05]** somebody like I mentioned earlier, it might be worth just submerging and

**[34:10]** unsubmerging in your ocean areas where you control. Picking up all of your units

**[34:15]** slowly. Gathering them together in one spot and then unsubmerging and then

**[34:20]** declaring that Absorb battle. Maybe this time you're eating... we talked about the

**[34:24]** theoretical maximum of Absorb. You can easily be rolling over 20 dice here and

**[34:30]** that's really what is going to wreck somebody who's sitting by themselves

**[34:34]** like a Cho-Cho or maybe a yellow sign that's drawn too much heat that has King

**[34:40]** and Haster and a big ball of units. You can really smash into that without a lot

**[34:45]** of fear as Cthulhu. Yeah, maybe there's a third option that's sort of a hybrid

**[34:50]** between the two. Maybe you only have a single Star Spawn and then a Shoggoth

**[34:54]** and then you're absorbing units. Yeah, you're gonna roll a pretty decent amount

**[34:58]** of dice, 20 dice or so. That's gonna be pretty nice to get the job done. One

**[35:04]** other thing you can really do as Cthulhu which I don't see that many people do

**[35:08]** but I think is extremely effective.

**[35:12]** You've heard me talk a lot about Submerge.

**[35:14]** I think this is like the key ability for this faction.

**[35:16]** If you understand Submerge and how it works really well,

**[35:20]** you can win against inexperienced players.

**[35:22]** You will destroy them.

**[35:24]** Why, what do I mean by that?

**[35:25]** This concept of dragging your feet

**[35:28]** that I talked about in my other episode,

**[35:30]** it's really on display with Submerge.

**[35:32]** So Lulu can actually do a pretty decent

**[35:35]** like sleeper impression.

**[35:38]** Go with me on this.

**[35:39]** So Submerging, it costs you one Power.

**[35:42]** Unsubmerging costs you zero Power.

**[35:45]** So when you are doing the full Spellbook Submerge,

**[35:50]** you're spending one Power.

**[35:52]** So one cost action, like we've talked about, that's nice.

**[35:56]** It doesn't cost a lot.

**[35:58]** It's the slowest thing that you can do.

**[35:59]** You're also taking a zero cost action.

**[36:01]** So if you start Submerging and Unsubmerging multiple times,

**[36:07]** what you're doing is basically spending one Power

**[36:10]** every other turn, spending one Power really slowly.

**[36:13]** So think about this against other factions

**[36:16]** who maybe the best that they can do is a one cost action.

**[36:20]** Think about Yellow Sign.

**[36:21]** The best that they can do to slow things down

**[36:24]** is take one cost actions.

**[36:26]** If you start the round on like 12 Power,

**[36:30]** and let's say everybody else is on 12 Power,

**[36:32]** and you just start Submerging and Unsubmerging

**[36:34]** over and over, you're just gonna be spending your Power

**[36:37]** half as fast as everybody else.

**[36:38]** So that can really set you up into a good spot

**[36:41]** to either fight somebody when they're out of Power

**[36:45]** and can't really react,

**[36:46]** or set up that Dreams play like we talked about.

**[36:49]** If you spend your Power really slowly,

**[36:51]** you may be in a spot where you're on five or six Power,

**[36:53]** and somebody else is out of Power.

**[36:55]** And if they've got two Gates,

**[36:56]** and they're not playing around Dreams,

**[36:59]** it's Dreams o'clock, and you're gonna be starting

**[37:01]** the next round on three or four or five Gates.

**[37:05]** Yeah, I think this stalling tactic

**[37:06]** is really, really effective.

**[37:08]** If nobody calls you out on it,

**[37:11]** hopefully you're playing with savvy players,

**[37:13]** and they aren't just gonna let you do that

**[37:15]** and get away with it.

**[37:16]** They're gonna probably come after your Gates,

**[37:17]** and you're gonna have to be forced to engage them

**[37:20]** and actually fight them and have something happen.

**[37:23]** And the last part of this guide,

**[37:24]** I'm gonna talk about ways to thwart the Great Cthulhu.

**[37:27]** I don't really wanna do that,

**[37:28]** because it's one of my favorite factions here,

**[37:30]** but there are some ways to be effective.

**[37:33]** First one I'll mention is Crawling Chaos is in the game.

**[37:37]** Damn it, Crawling Chaos.

**[37:40]** I talked about this at the top, just mentioned it.

**[37:43]** You really want to, if possible,

**[37:45]** have a friendly relationship with Crawling Chaos

**[37:48]** for as long as possible,

**[37:49]** and that is because of Crawling Chaos' Madness Spellbook.

**[37:53]** If you're on the wrong end of Crawling Chaos,

**[37:57]** they were gonna make your life miserable.

**[37:59]** They control where all the pains are happening,

**[38:01]** so all those awesome battles

**[38:03]** that we've been talking about setting up,

**[38:04]** well, if you get pained out to Crawling Chaos' specifications

**[38:08]** and they scatter you across the land,

**[38:11]** that's pretty much the worst thing that can happen for you,

**[38:13]** because you're gonna have to waste a bunch of Power

**[38:16]** like regrouping in the ocean,

**[38:18]** and you don't wanna be doing that.

**[38:20]** What you want to have happen

**[38:21]** is have Crawling Chaos pain you where you want,

**[38:25]** which is, in case it's not clear,

**[38:27]** every time you get pained out of one of these battles,

**[38:30]** if Crawling Chaos is not in the game,

**[38:31]** you wanna put yourself back in the ocean,

**[38:33]** because, again, with Submerge,

**[38:35]** you can only submerge when you're in an ocean area.

**[38:39]** Yes, be very mindful if Crawling Chaos is in the game.

**[38:42]** It's gonna affect the things

**[38:44]** that you can do pretty significantly

**[38:46]** if they are not in an alliance with you.

**[38:50]** Another way that you can kind of mess

**[38:53]** with Cthulhu significantly would be that South Pacific Gate.

**[38:56]** If you'll note on the Awakening requirements for Cthulhu,

**[39:00]** there needs to be a Gate in the South Pacific.

**[39:02]** Doesn't matter if Cthulhu controls the Gate,

**[39:04]** but there needs to be one Gate.

**[39:05]** If you're Opener, if you're Sleeper,

**[39:08]** you could potentially Curse Slumber that Gate

**[39:10]** or Beyond One that Gate,

**[39:12]** providing Cthulhu is not present because you can't do it

**[39:16]** in the presence of Great Old Ones, Beyond One, that is.

**[39:19]** If your Gate in the South Pacific moves,

**[39:23]** that is annoying.

**[39:24]** You're gonna have to,

**[39:25]** you can't like, you're not like locked out of the game,

**[39:27]** but you cannot afford to lose Cthulhu

**[39:30]** if your Gate in the South Pacific is gone

**[39:33]** because it's just gonna be a pain in the A

**[39:35]** to build it again and then awaken.

**[39:38]** People aren't gonna like chill and let you move in.

**[39:42]** And if they're smart enough to move your Gate

**[39:43]** out of South Pacific,

**[39:44]** they're also smart enough to stop you from building it again

**[39:47]** or make it so expensive and annoying for you to build again

**[39:51]** that their action, their one cost Beyond One

**[39:54]** will have paid for itself like so many times over, right?

**[39:57]** So yeah, keep your South Pacific Gate.

**[40:00]** I don't let anybody come for my starting Gates.

**[40:02]** I get very defensive.

**[40:04]** Any faction I play,

**[40:05]** if someone comes into my starting area and tries to take it,

**[40:08]** I'm gonna try and take it back for, just for my pride.

**[40:12]** One thing I mentioned earlier that I will,

**[40:16]** it bears repeating here.

**[40:17]** If you're playing against Great Cthulhu,

**[40:18]** just don't ever build a Gate in the ocean.

**[40:21]** There's no reason to do it.

**[40:23]** You're making Yawn of Thule better if you do.

**[40:25]** Don't build Gates in the ocean.

**[40:27]** If you're opener and you wanna get cool with Beyond One,

**[40:30]** cool, you can move Gates into the ocean

**[40:32]** to like buy favor from Cthulhu,

**[40:35]** but you really don't wanna be on the wrong side

**[40:37]** of Cthulhu as opener.

**[40:39]** They don't have that much combat dice in the end.

**[40:41]** So yeah, don't, if you wanna buy Cthulhu's favor,

**[40:44]** you wanna be Cthulhu's friend.

**[40:45]** You don't wanna be Cthulhu's enemy.

**[40:47]** One of the last things I could recommend that you do

**[40:50]** is deny those fight spell books.

**[40:52]** So what does that mean?

**[40:54]** If Cthulhu is going to unsubmerge,

**[40:57]** it's probably gonna be with Cthulhu

**[40:59]** when they're trying to get those spell books

**[41:00]** because they get the devour, right?

**[41:02]** If they're doing that and you still have Power,

**[41:03]** totally legit move to,

**[41:06]** let's say they unsubmerge at your Gate

**[41:08]** that has only one acolyte and one monster there.

**[41:11]** They unsubmerge, just move your acolyte out of the area

**[41:16]** so that there's only a single unit there.

**[41:17]** That's gonna force them to not only spend the Power

**[41:22]** to declare a battle against you,

**[41:23]** but then they're still gonna be looking

**[41:24]** for that second battle

**[41:25]** because they couldn't get the kills off that they needed to.

**[41:29]** So if you're ever, especially, I guess this goes double,

**[41:33]** if Cthulhu unsubmerges in their area

**[41:35]** with exactly three units or more,

**[41:39]** get out of there so that there's two or less

**[41:41]** because you're gonna deny them

**[41:43]** that second spell book requirement

**[41:45]** and that's gonna be pretty annoying for them

**[41:47]** to have to deal with.

**[41:48]** And then the other thing I think I've also mentioned

**[41:50]** several times would be playing around dreams.

**[41:54]** Don't get greedy for Gates

**[41:55]** if you're playing against great Cthulhu.

**[41:57]** Generally, if you're playing Cthulhu Wars,

**[41:59]** I maybe have mentioned this in my other episode,

**[42:01]** if you're on three Gates, you're doing pretty good.

**[42:04]** Don't get greedy and try to overextend

**[42:06]** and get four or five Gates.

**[42:08]** If you're playing with a savvy Cthulhu player

**[42:10]** and you don't play around dreams

**[42:12]** and have multiple acolytes at every Gate,

**[42:15]** they are gonna dreams you.

**[42:16]** They're gonna get up to four or five Gates

**[42:18]** and everyone's gonna be telling you

**[42:20]** how you threw the game afterwards

**[42:21]** and you don't wanna be there.

**[42:23]** You should be content with,

**[42:25]** be content with three Gates and two acolytes on each Gate.

**[42:28]** That's still 12 Power,

**[42:29]** regardless of whatever faction stuff you've got going on.

**[42:32]** If you've got all your acolytes,

**[42:34]** 12 Power is very respectable.

**[42:35]** And yeah, make it expensive for Cthulhu

**[42:38]** to take Gates from you.

**[42:39]** That's kind of the key.

**[42:42]** And yeah, I don't know how much else I have to say

**[42:46]** about great Cthulhu.

**[42:48]** Again, really, really fun faction.

**[42:50]** It's like the namesake of the game practically, Cthulhu.

**[42:53]** Great faction to place the other factions,

**[42:56]** great faction for new players,

**[42:58]** great faction for really experienced players.

**[43:01]** If you wanna really, really get good

**[43:03]** at managing your unit count in your pool,

**[43:07]** that's gonna help you play other factions as well.

**[43:09]** So like understanding that rain cycle

**[43:12]** of cycling out your Deep Ones and your acolytes

**[43:16]** to make sure you have fodder for dreams and absorb

**[43:19]** is gonna be really key to your success.

**[43:22]** Hopefully you found this guide useful

**[43:23]** and hopefully some people listen to this

**[43:26]** and I will continue to make these faction guides

**[43:30]** along with other Opening the Way episodes.

**[43:32]** So if you're still here, listener, thanks for listening

**[43:35]** and have a nice day, have a nice evening,
