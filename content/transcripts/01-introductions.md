## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, welcome to Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars. My name's Graham,

**[00:24]** I'll be your host. I'm really happy that you're joining me on the pilot episode of

**[00:29]** an idea that I had and trying to get off the ground. Basically in this episode, I just want to

**[00:35]** cover kind of my motivations for doing this, a little bit about myself, and talk to you a little

**[00:41]** bit about Cthulhu Wars. That's what we're here for. Just geek out about that and in like a long-form way,

**[00:47]** I'm not usually able to do with people in person. Let's start with the game. What is Cthulhu Wars?

**[00:52]** You probably already know that if you're listening to this, but just in case you don't, I would call

**[00:57]** Cthulhu Wars an area control game. It's an asymmetric area control game and it was created

**[01:03]** around 2015 by Peterson Games. In Cthulhu Wars, the players are fighting for control over Earth,

**[01:11]** similar to something that you might find in like a Risk, only this time everybody's playing as a

**[01:17]** different faction that's headed up by a different Great Old One and a couple of their monsters that

**[01:24]** work for them. Again, Great Old One, you may already know what that means if you're listening to this,

**[01:29]** but in case you don't, this is a concept created first by H.P. Lovecraft, the author, probably the

**[01:35]** father of cosmic horror genre, who went on to inspire a lot of other different authors like Stephen King.

**[01:43]** Anyway, he created a whole mythos of Great Old Ones, which are kind of like large, uncaring

**[01:50]** monsters, and just created this idea of cosmic horror, which is sort of different from your typical

**[01:57]** horror where maybe there's a slasher and the horror is done once the slasher is dead. Cosmic horror,

**[02:04]** there's usually some opposing force that's either unknowable or unbeatable by the protagonist,

**[02:11]** and you just kind of have to deal with it and live the best way that you can. One of the big

**[02:16]** differences between Cthulhu Wars and other games like it, shout out Arkham Horror, the card game,

**[02:23]** another one of my favorite games, Cthulhu Wars, you're actually playing as the baddies, as the

**[02:28]** monsters, as opposed to many other games in this cosmic horror genre, you're trying to thwart

**[02:33]** the adverts of the mythos. So that's one thing about Cthulhu Wars that's very different that I

**[02:39]** really, really appreciate about it. Tell them a little bit about how I got acquainted with Cthulhu Wars.

**[02:43]** I've probably known about it since 2017, admired it from afar. I remember once seeing it in my local

**[02:51]** game store with my cousin, and it was a little bit too expensive for us at the time, but we were both

**[02:55]** very kind of mesmerized by it when we did see it. I finally got a hold of the game in 2019 after

**[03:03]** somebody at my work happened to just post a sale of the base game, and then I believe it was

**[03:11]** opener, sleeper, Windwalker, the Azathoth faction, a couple other odds and ends. I just sprung for it,

**[03:20]** and I'm really glad I did. It's some of the best money I've ever spent on board games, and it's

**[03:25]** grown to be one of my favorite games. So yeah, why is Cthulhu Wars so great? I mean, asymmetry for one

**[03:33]** thing. I've played a decent amount of Risk. Well, in Risk, everybody has the exact same pieces. In

**[03:38]** Cthulhu Wars, that's not the case at all. The only units that people really have in common that do the

**[03:44]** same thing are Acolytes. I'm not really going to get into that in this episode. That'll be next

**[03:50]** episode when I talk about how to play. So the asymmetry is really there. All the factions are

**[03:56]** kind of operating on a little bit of a different axis, and learning about each one, playing each one,

**[04:01]** playing against each one, is just a task in itself. So really playing one game against

**[04:06]** Great Cthulhu or the Ancients is not really enough to know everything that they're about,

**[04:12]** everything that they're capable of. Going along with the asymmetry, there's just many, many decision

**[04:18]** points. Part of the thing that you have to do in this game is take control of different Spellbooks,

**[04:24]** and every game you can take them in any order that you like, and you have six of them. So

**[04:28]** many combinations, many permutations, many decision points that you can do at any point in the game.

**[04:35]** And I find that that just really adds to the repealability of this game, and that's really

**[04:40]** what I'm after in terms of any card game or board game that's what keeps me coming back as like a

**[04:45]** fresh experience every time I play. And this game really has that in spades. I probably have,

**[04:50]** between games with humans and games with AI, probably over 100 games under my belt, but

**[04:55]** hasn't gotten stale for me yet, not even close. So as you can see, I'm making a podcast about it,

**[05:01]** so not exactly getting bored of it. What else is great about this? Just physically, the game is

**[05:07]** huge. It's stupidly big. I'm looking at the Great Cthulhu figurine in front of me right now. It's,

**[05:15]** I don't know, 10 inches tall. They could have made this game probably 40% smaller and 40% cheaper,

**[05:22]** but then it wouldn't be quite the game that it is right now. I love that the pieces are very,

**[05:28]** very big. I love that the map is very, very big. That's usually like the first thing that people

**[05:33]** really are surprised and enjoy about the game when they're seeing it for the first time.

**[05:39]** You're telling them about it. It's an area control game. Tell them that it's like Risk,

**[05:43]** and they're thinking, oh, okay, well, there's just going to be some, you know, small pieces here,

**[05:48]** and we're going to do our thing. No, it's giant. There's actually not that many pieces that everybody

**[05:52]** has. They're just really, really big. Yeah, let's see. What else do I want to cover here? I think,

**[05:58]** lastly, why am I making a podcast about Cthulhu Wars in the first place? So in short, nothing like

**[06:05]** this really exists. Definitely not in this medium. What I mean is there's a decent amount of

**[06:11]** instructional videos on YouTube. So shout out Gray Wizard Gaming, who, as I was learning to play this

**[06:19]** game myself, I watched every single video that he made. They're all great. I'd recommend you check

**[06:23]** them out. There's also been, you know, a decent amount of written content about Cthulhu Wars.

**[06:28]** There's plenty of threads on BoardGameGeek, as well as strategy art. There's a strategy article for

**[06:34]** every faction written by Sandy Peterson himself. So I highly recommend those as well. Really kind of

**[06:40]** changed the way that I think about the game. Please check out all those things if you've got time.

**[06:47]** They're all worthwhile to watch and to read. Coming back to the podcast, this doesn't exist yet,

**[06:52]** so I'm just spelling a thing that doesn't exist. Additionally, all of these other contents that

**[06:57]** I've been talking about, they actually have aged a little bit. Most of them, I feel like they've come

**[07:03]** out around 2017, 2018. All of that's in the before time. If you're listening to this now,

**[07:10]** it's currently 2022. We're trying to get out of the coronavirus pandemic, and we're still waiting

**[07:16]** on Onslaught 4 with bated breath. Some people have their pitchforks out. Other people like me just have

**[07:22]** our patience. Patience is a virtue, so you should be virtuous. So there's a lot of resources out there

**[07:30]** for learning the basics of Cthulhu Wars. I feel like that's been covered pretty well by Grey Wizard,

**[07:36]** Sturid Gaming, Sandy, and others. So I could do that. I could make a series on YouTube, but

**[07:42]** I chose this podcast because it's not been done yet, and I think this is a good medium for

**[07:48]** talking about the game, geeking out about it in a long-form way that just doesn't exist.

**[07:54]** That's kind of what I'm after here. What am I planning to cover in this podcast? Trying to cover it all.

**[07:59]** I want to cover all the factions, and I mean all the factions in 2022. Like I said, a lot of things

**[08:07]** have aged a little bit. There's been several balance changes to some factions, for example.

**[08:12]** There's more factions out there that are coming, like Demon, Sultan, and the Cats. I've played with

**[08:17]** them both on the Cthulhu Wars Discord, which I will link to this podcast because that's kind of another

**[08:23]** ulterior motive I have is to get more people there and get more games going. So I want to cover all the

**[08:28]** factions and maybe talk about the metagame, such in 2022. I want to cover all the relevant expansions,

**[08:36]** like all the alternate maps, all the neutral units, other topics throughout the game. I don't have an

**[08:42]** infinite amount of content here, but I do have enough to get, I think, quite a few episodes out

**[08:47]** here. So hopefully people will listen to this, and I will keep putting these out. For sure, I think the

**[08:53]** main meat and potatoes of this podcast series will be deep diving on every faction. I'm happy to do

**[09:00]** that. Love geeking out about the different factions, and I can do that in a way where people don't tell

**[09:05]** me, like, just stop, you've said enough. I'm going to keep going for as long as I want to.

**[09:12]** Let's see. I'm going to cover it all. I also want to, I think I should have mentioned this a little

**[09:16]** earlier as well. The deep lore and story surrounding this game is another thing that's really, really

**[09:24]** interesting and important to me. I think I mentioned from the top, like, H.P. Lovecraft and Cosmic Horror,

**[09:31]** my favorite genre. I feel like I've known about Cosmic Horror my entire life and been a fan of it.

**[09:36]** I didn't really know about Lovecraft or just that label of Cosmic Horror until probably when I was

**[09:43]** getting out of college at question mark date because I don't want to date myself. There's lots of authors

**[09:49]** who've added to this mythology just aside from Lovecraft, and clearly Sandy Peterson and everybody

**[09:56]** else who is working on this game has read most or all of these stories, and one thing I absolutely

**[10:03]** adore about this game is the care that's gone into, like, not only pulling all the deep cuts from

**[10:10]** various Lovecraft stories, various stories written by other authors, contemporaries of Lovecraft,

**[10:16]** putting them into this game for one thing, but also, like, lovingly taking those story beats and kind of

**[10:23]** translating them mechanically into the game in, like, a really elegant way. If you've read some of these

**[10:29]** stories and then you play with some of these great old ones and monsters, you will have, like, an aha

**[10:34]** moment more than once where you say, like, oh, that's this that was mentioned in this story, like, this monster,

**[10:40]** that's from that story. I'm definitely not going to be shy about telling you which story things are from.

**[10:45]** I'm going to be trying to quote stories where I can here and there. Hopefully that just adds to the

**[10:51]** experience of this podcast. Maybe I consider even doing, like, bonus episodes where I even just go read

**[10:59]** a story from top to bottom. Many of these stories are old enough that they're in the public domain, so I've

**[11:04]** got no reservations about doing that. I think that's all I really have for this pilot episode.

**[11:11]** Like I said, I'd be really, really thankful if you stick around and listen to a couple more episodes.

**[11:16]** I'm hoping by the time I upload any of this for others to listen to, I'm going to do at least a few

**[11:22]** episodes at once, including my first faction overview. I'll probably cover Great Cthulhu first, so.

**[11:28]** Thanks for your time. Hope you enjoyed listening, and I hope you have a great day, evening, wherever it is you are. Bye.
