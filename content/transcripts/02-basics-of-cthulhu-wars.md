## Transcript

**[00:00]** Hello, and welcome to Opening the Way, a podcast for fans of Cthulhu Wars.

**[00:23]** My name's Graham.

**[00:24]** I'll be your host.

**[00:25]** For this episode and the following episode, I am going to go into the rules of Cthulhu

**[00:32]** Wars, how to play Cthulhu Wars is going to be mainly this episode, and the following

**[00:37]** episode is going to be the more intermediate, advanced ideas I probably wouldn't tell somebody

**[00:43]** the first time they played, things that you should know if you're going to get good and,

**[00:48]** you know, grind your friends into the dirt and make sure they never win another game.

**[00:52]** Let's start with how to play.

**[00:55]** Basically the setup of the game is pretty straightforward.

**[00:59]** You're going to want to figure out how many players you have, and then whatever map you're

**[01:02]** playing on, if you're playing for the first time, I recommend playing on Earth, of course.

**[01:07]** Every map in this game is going to have a three-player side and a five-player side.

**[01:12]** If you were playing with four players, you're going to choose one three-player half and

**[01:17]** one five-player half.

**[01:19]** Otherwise, if you're playing with three or five players, you're going to use both the

**[01:22]** three-player halves or both the five-player halves.

**[01:26]** Next, everybody is going to pick their factions and set up their factions.

**[01:32]** That can be more or less straightforward depending on what everybody picks.

**[01:36]** Some areas on the map have starting glyphs on them, so only one faction can start there,

**[01:43]** and if they're in the game, they're going to start there every time.

**[01:46]** When I'm talking about that, I'm saying things like the South Pacific, where Cthulhu starts,

**[01:51]** or West Africa, where Black Goat starts, always, or where South Asia, where Crawling

**[01:58]** Chaos starts, Europe, where Yellow Sign starts, etc.

**[02:02]** There's a couple factions where they have a variable start location, such as Opener,

**[02:07]** who can start literally anywhere once most of the other factions have set up.

**[02:12]** Wind Walker has a choice of the North or South Pole.

**[02:15]** You got the Cho-Cho, and the Ancients, whose starting instructions are actually escaping

**[02:20]** me right now.

**[02:22]** That's not important.

**[02:23]** I will come back to it later.

**[02:24]** Read on your faction card.

**[02:25]** It will tell you how to set up with them.

**[02:28]** Now you're set up and you are ready to actually play the game, let's get into how to play.

**[02:35]** Before we get into the phases of the game, let's do a little overview of the faction

**[02:39]** card itself.

**[02:41]** You got your faction name that's up in the top left.

**[02:45]** You've got your portrait, where you're seeing a little bit of a great old one.

**[02:48]** You've got your Power track that goes up to 20, running along the top of the faction

**[02:52]** board there.

**[02:54]** You've got your unique faction ability that's different for every single faction you're

**[02:57]** going to want to pay close attention to that and use it as much as you can.

**[03:02]** Well, utilize it in useful situations, I'll leave it at that.

**[03:06]** You got your setup instructions.

**[03:08]** That's going to tell you where to set up and how to set up.

**[03:12]** You've got your Cultist monster information and great old one information below.

**[03:17]** You've got a cost, they've got a combat, you can all read that pretty clearly there.

**[03:22]** You've got your Spellbook requirements, all the models hopefully, and you should have

**[03:26]** all six Spellbooks that go with your faction.

**[03:29]** If you've got all that, great, you're ready to play.

**[03:33]** Okay, last thing on the setup, your setup, all the factions are set up, you got to figure

**[03:37]** out who the first player is.

**[03:39]** That's always going to be the faction's name alphabetically, unless Great Cthulhu is in

**[03:43]** the game, in which case Great Cthulhu is always going to go first, because it's Cthulhu

**[03:48]** Wars.

**[03:49]** The final last thing you're going to do for setup is going to be set everybody's Power

**[03:54]** to eight, and that's because everybody's going to have a starting Gate that's controlled

**[03:59]** by a Cultist, and they're going to have the rest of their acolytes there.

**[04:02]** So if you want to count this up, it will make more sense when I go over gather Power, but

**[04:08]** you'll have three Power for your controlled Gate, plus five Power for all of your acolytes.

**[04:14]** That adds up to eight Power.

**[04:15]** Everyone's going to start the game at eight Power.

**[04:16]** Getting into playing the game, I think it's useful to usually tell new players, how do

**[04:22]** you win this game?

**[04:23]** What do you have to do to win?

**[04:24]** So there are two objectives that you need to do in order to win a game of Cthulhu Wars.

**[04:30]** First objective, get to 30 or more doom points.

**[04:35]** Doom is going to be something that you accrue over the course of the game in a couple of

**[04:39]** different ways, which I'm going to explain.

**[04:42]** Get 30 or more doom points, have the most doom points at the end of the game is one

**[04:46]** objective.

**[04:47]** Your second objective, you cannot win the game unless you have also gotten all six of

**[04:53]** your Spellbooks on your faction card.

**[04:56]** So if you're looking at your faction card, there's six different Spellbook requirements.

**[05:01]** You're going to have to do all of those over the course of the game in order to win.

**[05:06]** If the game ends and somebody gets to 30 doom, it doesn't matter how much doom you have.

**[05:11]** If you have less than six Spellbooks, you're considered to be in last place.

**[05:14]** So kind of not a good look to not get all of your Spellbooks.

**[05:18]** Sometimes you just have one of those games and it's a train wreck and you can't really

**[05:22]** avoid it, but mainly just for your pride, it's better to get six books and be last place

**[05:28]** than have the most doom, but not have all of your books.

**[05:32]** Like I said, there's a couple of ways these can get derailed.

**[05:35]** Some faction specific ways of getting derailed, which I'll go into in the faction overview,

**[05:41]** but know that getting the six books is very important and it's not just some chore that

**[05:45]** you're going to have to do.

**[05:46]** You're going to want to do these things.

**[05:48]** You're going to want to earn these Spellbooks because they do help you and they give you

**[05:52]** extra abilities.

**[05:54]** One last thing that's helpful for new players about the Spellbook requirements would be,

**[05:59]** you know, if you're ever not sure about what to do in a game, just look at your Spellbooks.

**[06:04]** They're going to tell you some stuff that you need to do.

**[06:07]** So don't get bogged down with decision paralysis if you're playing Black Goat and you need

**[06:12]** to be in eight areas.

**[06:13]** More on that in my faction guide for Black Goat.

**[06:16]** You're going to want to figure out a plan to do that.

**[06:18]** Think about how to achieve that thing.

**[06:20]** Think less about how do I stop the other players from doing their thing, you know, unless they're

**[06:25]** really bugging you right from the beginning of the game.

**[06:28]** Okay, at this point you're completely set up.

**[06:31]** Everyone has their faction cards.

**[06:33]** Everybody's score marker is set to zero on the Doom Track.

**[06:36]** Everybody's Power is set to eight.

**[06:38]** That's your controlled Gate plus your six acolytes, and you're ready to play.

**[06:43]** So the game has three phases.

**[06:45]** The action phase, the gather Power phase, I guess technically four, determining the

**[06:50]** first player, and then the doom phase.

**[06:52]** So I'm going to walk through each of these.

**[06:54]** I'm going to start with the action phase because that's actually where the game begins in the

**[06:59]** first round.

**[07:00]** Everybody has eight Power to work with, and the players are each going to spend one or

**[07:05]** more Power to take an action, and the players are each going to take actions one at a time,

**[07:11]** going clockwise or counterclockwise, that's determined by the first player, until everybody

**[07:16]** has spent their Power and is out of actions to perform.

**[07:21]** Let's go over all the actions that we can do.

**[07:24]** There's a way these are written out on a tip card.

**[07:26]** I'm going to go a different route.

**[07:28]** Moving your units.

**[07:30]** Spend one Power per unit you want to move.

**[07:34]** Cost the same amount to move any unit.

**[07:36]** Units can only move to adjacent areas, unless you're a Crawling Chaos.

**[07:41]** More on that in a Crawling Chaos guide.

**[07:43]** You're only going to be able to move to adjacent areas, and it's going to cost you one Power

**[07:47]** per unit you move.

**[07:49]** You can move more than one unit, you're just going to have to pay for it if you want to

**[07:53]** move them at the same time.

**[07:54]** So for example, I'm playing Great Cthulhu.

**[07:57]** I'm starting in the South Pacific, and I want to move an acolyte over to the South Atlantic,

**[08:03]** which is adjacent to the South Pacific.

**[08:05]** That's going to cost me one Power.

**[08:08]** If I wanted to do something else, like move two units to the South Atlantic, it would

**[08:12]** cost me two Power at once, if I wanted to do it all at the same time.

**[08:16]** If I wanted to do something different, like split them between the South Atlantic or the

**[08:21]** North Pacific, same deal, it would cost two Power if you did it at the same time.

**[08:25]** I keep saying doing it at the same time, that will make more sense later, but generally

**[08:30]** you're going to want to only move a single unit at a time, unless you're feeling under

**[08:36]** pressure and you want to move more than one.

**[08:39]** That's moving.

**[08:40]** You're going to need to move in order to do another action, which is build a Gate.

**[08:45]** That is always going to cost you three Power to build a Gate.

**[08:48]** Only your acolytes can build Gates, and you can only build Gates in an area that's

**[08:54]** does not currently contain a Gate. Gates are important in the game because if you

**[08:59]** hold on to a Gate at the end of the action phase, when the game gets around

**[09:03]** to the doom phase, you're gonna be gaining a doom for every Gate control. So

**[09:07]** the more Gates you control, the better, but building Gates is a little bit

**[09:12]** expensive, so that's another thing to be mindful of. And it's actually cheaper

**[09:17]** generally to steal a Gate from somebody than it is to build a Gate, and I'll

**[09:22]** explain why a little later. Let's talk about how to summon a monster. So you've

**[09:28]** got a Gate, you've got an accolade on the Gate, you've got your faction card which

**[09:33]** tells you what monsters you have available to you and how much Power it

**[09:37]** is to summon each monster. So you can only summon a monster at your controlled

**[09:42]** Gate. You're gonna pay its cost and you're gonna place your monster at the

**[09:46]** Gate. Let's go back to my Cthulhu example. I'm playing Cthulhu. I want to summon a

**[09:51]** Starspawn. It has a cost of 3, and if I pay that 3, I can place it at any Gate I

**[09:58]** control. Got other monsters like the Shoggoths or the Deep Ones, they cost 2

**[10:05]** Power and 1 Power respectively, so pay that cost, place the monster at your

**[10:08]** Gate. You'll also notice from looking at your card, your monsters have a combat,

**[10:14]** and we will come back to what that means very shortly. Let's talk about how to

**[10:20]** awaken your Great Old One. I'm using a little bit of a legalese in the game

**[10:25]** here. Awakening, not the same as summoning, not the same as recruiting, which I'll

**[10:29]** talk about in a second. To awaken your Great Old One, you're gonna want to

**[10:33]** follow the instructions on your faction card. Great Cthulhu himself must be

**[10:39]** awakened at a Gate in the South Pacific. You need not control that Gate, and

**[10:44]** you're gonna pay 10 Power to awaken Cthulhu. Some Great Old Ones have pretty

**[10:50]** straightforward costs to awaken, so Crawling Chaos, for example, Norlathotep.

**[10:55]** Awakening just costs 10 Power. Displace it at any one of your controlled Gates.

**[10:59]** Other Great Old Ones have a little bit more complicated awakening instructions,

**[11:04]** and that's fine. You're just gonna want to pay attention to that on your faction

**[11:07]** card. Just to give you an example, Yellow Sign, Awakening the King in Yellow, can

**[11:12]** only be done in an area that is lacking a Gate, so you're gonna want to read that

**[11:17]** before you go ahead and build a Gate and then try to summon the king, awaken the

**[11:21]** king to protect your Gate. We're summoning monsters, we're awakening Great

**[11:25]** Old Ones, and we want to get people's Gates. We want to build Gates, but we want

**[11:30]** to steal Gates. How exactly does one take Gates from other players? So this is a

**[11:36]** very important and key concept. There's two ways of doing that. The first way

**[11:40]** we're gonna talk about is capturing a Cultist. What does that mean? You're gonna

**[11:45]** need to have a monster at a Gate. Let's set up a couple different scenarios

**[11:52]** where we can capture. Great Cthulhu has a Gate. It's got an acolyte on the Gate. It

**[11:57]** does not have any monsters there protecting the Gate. And let's say

**[12:00]** Crawling Chaos flies in there with a flying polyp. As an action, Crawling Chaos

**[12:05]** can pay one Power to capture the Great Cthulhu acolyte. When they do that, they

**[12:10]** put the acolyte on their faction card. And basically what that does is deprives

**[12:16]** Crawling Chaos of one acolyte for the rest of the action phase. But in addition,

**[12:20]** during the gather Power phase, the acolyte gets sacrificed and the

**[12:27]** person who captured it gains one extra Power. So capturing is great because it

**[12:33]** stops people from having an acolyte available to them. It also gets you an

**[12:37]** extra Power. So you can think of a little bit of it as like banking up Power for

**[12:42]** the next phase. That was a completely uncontested Gate, so it's easy to capture

**[12:47]** there. How about a different example? Let's say Cthulhu has a Deep One and an

**[12:54]** acolyte at the Gate. And Crawling Chaos flies a flying polyp in to try to

**[12:59]** capture. Well, don't even bother because you're not going to be able to as

**[13:04]** long as there is a monster guarding the Gate with the acolyte. The other opposing

**[13:09]** factions cannot capture you with their monsters. So monsters protect against

**[13:15]** other monsters. This is a key concept. Yet another scenario with the Gate where

**[13:20]** we've got Cthulhu with a Deep One and an acolyte there, and this time Crawling

**[13:26]** Chaos really wants to capture. So they fly in Narlathotep himself, who is a

**[13:31]** Great Old One. Great Old Ones supersede monsters, so monsters do not protect

**[13:37]** against capture from Great Old Ones. So if things get back around to Crawling Chaos,

**[13:42]** they can spend one and capture the acolyte in the area that has the Cthulhu

**[13:47]** acolyte, the Deep One, and Narlathotep. There's no Great Old One defending, so

**[13:51]** Crawling Chaos can capture that acolyte. And let's go to the final scenario where

**[13:56]** there is an acolyte, there's a Deep One, there's also a Great Cthulhu himself. If

**[14:02]** Crawling Chaos were to fly in there with Flying Polyp and Narlathotep, because

**[14:07]** there's a Great Old One there, you cannot capture this acolyte. Great Old Ones

**[14:10]** protect from capture against other Great Old Ones. That's a key concept you need

**[14:16]** to know. Monsters protect against monsters. Great Old Ones protect against other

**[14:21]** Great Old Ones. Great Old Ones supersede monsters in terms of capture. Let's

**[14:27]** suppose your Cultist does get captured, it does get sacrificed, and we go back

**[14:31]** around to the action phase again. That brings us to one action that we are not

**[14:36]** going to be able to do in the first action phase most likely, which is

**[14:38]** recruit a Cultist. So you can recruit a Cultist anywhere where you have a unit,

**[14:44]** whether that is a monster, another acolyte, or a Great Old One. You can do it

**[14:50]** anywhere. That makes it a little different from summoning. Summoning

**[14:53]** monsters you can only do at your controlled Gate. We talked about

**[14:57]** capturing as one way to get control of Gates. Another thing we should talk about

**[15:02]** then is battling. I mentioned a little earlier, all of your monsters and your

**[15:07]** Great Old Ones, they all have a combat value, and that is how many combat dice

**[15:12]** they get to roll. Combat dice in Cthulhu Wars, they have three different results.

**[15:16]** There's a kill, that's only one out of six. There's two pains, that's one in

**[15:22]** three, and there's three blanks. So you're most likely to roll blanks, and kills are

**[15:28]** the least likely thing to be rolled. If you are going to battle somebody, you pay

**[15:32]** one Power and you declare a battle with one faction that you have units in the

**[15:37]** area with you. Let's set up a battle example. There's a Gate that Great Cthulhu

**[15:43]** controls, and they have a Deep One there and an Acolyte. Crawling Chaos wants the

**[15:50]** Gate, so they fly in a Hunting Horror that has two combat dice. On their next

**[15:55]** action, Crawling Chaos declares a battle, and so the dice are rolled. The Hunting

**[15:59]** Horror rolls two dice, the Deep One rolls one dice. So we roll our dice and we

**[16:05]** apply the results. If there's any kills rolled, the faction on the receiving end

**[16:10]** chooses a unit to eliminate. That's important. So always, if you're on the

**[16:15]** receiving end, you're going to be the one that assigns the kills and pains. Let's

**[16:20]** say there was a kill rolled. Great Cthulhu might choose to put that kill on

**[16:24]** their Deep One, or they might choose to put that kill on their Acolyte. There's

**[16:28]** arguments for doing either one. I can go into that more maybe in the intermediate

**[16:33]** advanced talk. Let's say there are some pains rolled. So let's just

**[16:37]** hypothetically, the Hunting Horror rolls one kill and one pain against the Deep

**[16:42]** One, who only rolls a pain back. Cthulhu is gonna have to choose a unit to

**[16:47]** eliminate. Let's say they eliminate the Deep One. Then they're gonna have to pain

**[16:51]** their Acolyte. If you get pained, you need to retreat to an adjacent area that does

**[16:57]** not contain any units of the faction that you just fought. So you cannot pain

**[17:03]** into an area that has Crawling Chaos units. Normally you can pain back

**[17:07]** anywhere you want. So let's say this is in the battles in the South Pacific.

**[17:11]** Great Cthulhu gets their Acolyte pained. Most of the time they can just pain it

**[17:15]** safely back into the South Pacific area where they started, where they have their

**[17:19]** other units, and it's no problem. Crawling Chaos in the game, they might have

**[17:22]** madness. I'm not really gonna explain why that's important here. One other thing

**[17:28]** about pains, if you are ever surrounded, can't get pained anywhere safely, that is

**[17:33]** an additional elimination that you have to make on one of your units. So that's

**[17:38]** important to keep in mind. So at this point we've gone over all of the normal

**[17:44]** actions that one can take in the game. Now let's talk a little bit about a

**[17:48]** special action. There's two special actions in the game that we call unlimited actions. Maybe

**[17:53]** there's more if you're playing Black Goat, but I'm not going to talk about that here.

**[17:57]** First unlimited action everybody has access to at the start of the game is stepping on and off a

**[18:03]** Gate. An unlimited action means you can do it any number of times during your turn as long as you

**[18:09]** have the ability to pay for it. This first unlimited action stepping on and off the Gate

**[18:13]** doesn't cost you anything. So basically all this means is like let's go back to that Gate example

**[18:18]** where there's a great Cthulhu Cultist by itself. Crawling Chaos flies in a hunting horror and one

**[18:24]** of their acolytes Cthulhu doesn't have any Power so on their next action Crawling Chaos captures

**[18:29]** the Cthulhu acolyte. Then as an unlimited action they can immediately step onto the Gate. Mostly

**[18:35]** this action is going to be used to step onto Gates and not step off Gates. I don't know if you want

**[18:39]** to get political and step off the Gate for some purpose. To willingly give a Gate to somebody

**[18:46]** you're able to do that. The last unlimited action we should definitely spend some time talking about

**[18:52]** because it is very important. That is unlimited battle. I explained about battles and they cost

**[18:58]** one Power to initiate, but what I didn't mention is once you get all six of your spell books

**[19:03]** you unlock unlimited battle and that means you can do any combination of paying one Power to

**[19:11]** do an unlimited battle and then taking your normal action or vice versa. Let me give you

**[19:18]** a couple examples of how unlimited battle is very useful. Cthulhu, they have a Gate. Crawling

**[19:25]** Chaos wants that Gate. That same Gate that we've been talking about the whole time. It's just

**[19:29]** getting fought over the entire game. Crawling Chaos, if they have units in the area they can

**[19:33]** declare unlimited battle. Let's say they have that same result we talked about. A kill and a pain.

**[19:38]** Maybe Crawling Chaos gets pained out and as does Cthulhu, but that was an unlimited battle that

**[19:43]** was not even Crawling Chaos's normal action. So after they pay that one Power for the battle

**[19:48]** they could then as their normal action pay a couple of Power to then like move in an acolyte

**[19:55]** and a monster to defend it. That's their normal action which they took after their unlimited

**[20:00]** battle action. You could also do the reverse. Maybe that reverse is even more common. Crawling

**[20:05]** Chaos wants that South Atlantic Gate so they decide now that they have unlimited battle they

**[20:10]** just move in Gnarlathotep and then they spend one Power and declare an unlimited battle right away.

**[20:17]** Basically unlimited battle makes it so that you can move in and do your thing, what you want to do

**[20:22]** which is battle, before the other players get a chance to react. Before you have unlimited battle

**[20:27]** people are going to have a turn, assuming they have Power, they're going to have a turn to react

**[20:32]** to you and do something to you. Unlimited battle is a big game changer for specifically the combat

**[20:42]** factions like Cthulhu and Crawling Chaos. Once they have unlimited battle they are very scary.

**[20:47]** You do not want to mess around or get caught slipping with unprotected Great Old Ones or

**[20:52]** unprotected Gates when another fighty faction has unlimited combat. With that being said, I think

**[21:00]** we're through with the action phase and now we can talk about the other three phases of the game

**[21:06]** which are not that complicated. We've done our action phase. Everyone's taken their actions.

**[21:12]** Everybody has spent all their Power. People have probably built a Gate. Maybe somebody got greedy

**[21:17]** and built two Gates. Now we go to gather Power where we figure out how much Power everybody has

**[21:23]** and then subsequently we'll figure out who the first player is. In the gather Power phase you get

**[21:28]** one Power per acolyte you have out. You've got two Power per controlled Gate. I find it much easier to

**[21:34]** just count my controlled Gates as three Power so I'm just going to keep talking like that going

**[21:38]** forward. Three Power per controlled Gate. One Power per acolyte. You've got one Power per Cultist that

**[21:46]** you sacrifice so if you remember from earlier, if we capture any acolytes we're going to get Power

**[21:51]** for them here. We also get one Power for any abandoned Gate on the map. That means any Gate

**[21:56]** that's not currently controlled by somebody once we get to gather Power. That's going to provide

**[22:01]** everybody one Power which is kind of nice. Lastly in gather Power, suppose you really got boardwiped

**[22:07]** and you got sent back to the Stone Age and you have nothing. You're at the half Power rule which

**[22:12]** is going to be you're at half the amount of Power as the player with the highest amount of Power.

**[22:18]** Don't worry if you get completely wiped off the map. You do have a way to come back.

**[22:22]** You will have some Power to spend. That's the half Power rule. After we figured out everybody's Power

**[22:27]** we figure out who the first player is. That's going to be whoever has the most Power now.

**[22:32]** If that's ever a tie or it's in question, the player who was the first player in the last

**[22:38]** action phase will choose. And that's the gather Power phase and the determined first player phase.

**[22:46]** Now we're on to the doom phase, the last phase we want to talk about. This is important for

**[22:50]** winning the game. Like I said you're going to want to get to 30 doom. In the doom phase the

**[22:55]** first thing that happens is everyone is going to get their initial doom. That is going to be

**[22:59]** one doom per controlled Gate that you have. Let's assume we just played a whole action phase, the

**[23:06]** first action phase. Everybody built a Gate and protected their Gates. All the players are going

**[23:11]** to be controlling two Gates at the start of the doom phase, so everybody's initial doom is going

**[23:15]** to be two. You may have other effects in the doom phase, so just for example death from below for

**[23:23]** sleeper. You're going to want to pass the turn from player to player to see if they have doom

**[23:28]** phase effects, but also to see if anybody wants to do a Ritual of Annihilation. That is going to be

**[23:34]** a cost that you pay. It gets more expensive for each time somebody does one. The cost is going to

**[23:40]** vary. There's a track that tracks the cost of a ritual. That's going to change a little bit

**[23:44]** depending on the number of players. It's a cost that you pay. It starts at five every game. If you

**[23:49]** pay for a ritual, you will get an additional doom for every Gate that you control. On top of that,

**[23:56]** if you have a great old one, one or more great old ones, you will earn an Elder Sign for every great

**[24:02]** old one you have. There's other ways to earn Elder Signs in Cthulhu Wars, but basically they're

**[24:08]** hidden doom points. Elder Signs can range between one and three points. There's more ones than there

**[24:15]** are twos than there are threes. So over the course of the game, players are going to be getting elder

**[24:20]** signs from ritualing. Every faction also has another way of obtaining Elder Signs, so when the game is

**[24:26]** going on, you're not really going to know who's in first place unless people reveal their Elder Signs

**[24:32]** to you. One more time, if you ritual, you will get one doom per controlled Gate and you'll get

**[24:39]** one or more Elder Signs depending on your number of great old ones. So let me give you an example.

**[24:44]** Yellow sign had a really good turn. They have three Gates and they have both their great old

**[24:49]** ones, so they're going to get three initial doom. Now they have the option to ritual. They might do

**[24:55]** that. They'll pay five, they'll ritual, they'll get three more doom plus an Elder Sign for each of

**[25:00]** their great old ones. So that is no joke. That is at least five doom. Likely you can count the

**[25:06]** Elder Signs as like 1.67 doom, so at least five doom, probably a little bit more than that.

**[25:12]** Ritualing, the more Gates you have, the better it's going to be. So I don't recommend ritualing

**[25:18]** on one Gate necessarily unless you are really close to winning. If you're on four or five Gates,

**[25:24]** probably strongly consider ritualing unless you're afraid that it's going to draw too much attention

**[25:29]** or heat from the other players at the table. More Gates, more likely to ritual. Less Gates, less likely

**[25:35]** to ritual. And that's the doom phase. At this point we have covered, I think, all of the basics on how

**[25:45]** to play the game. Yeah, I think I will end this episode here. Thanks so much for listening. This

**[25:52]** has been Opening the Way. My name's Graham. I'm figuring out if I want to do any social media

**[25:59]** for this. I don't usually participate in social media. If you do want to ever contact me, you can

**[26:03]** find me on Discord at Killa Graham. That's Killa like Ghostface Killa and Graham like The Cracker.

**[26:10]** Find me on Discord. Please reach out, say hello. Join the Cthulhu Wars Discord server and let's

**[26:17]** play a game sometime. Until then, thanks for listening and have a good day, good evening,
