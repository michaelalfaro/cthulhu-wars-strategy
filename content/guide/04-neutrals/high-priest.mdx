# High Priest

The High Priest expansion gives every faction access to one additional cultist — but this one costs 3 Power to recruit, can be sacrificed at instant speed to refund 2 Power, and changes how the opening turns of Cthulhu Wars play out for almost every faction.

**Episode:** 6 — *Getting High For the First Time*

## What Is a High Priest?

High Priests are cultists with an extra ability. They follow the standard cultist rules in every respect:

- Recruited as an action (requires a friendly unit in the target area)
- Generate 1 Power per round during the Gather Power phase
- Can build and control Gates
- Can be captured by enemy factions

**Every faction gets exactly one High Priest.** If you play Tcho-Tcho, you already have three High Priests baked into your faction — adding this expansion does not give Tcho-Tcho a fourth.

## The Rules

### Unspeakable Oath

> *At the end of any player's action — even if it is not your turn — you may sacrifice your High Priest and return it to your pool to gain 2 Power. This can also be done during the Gather Power phase or the Doom phase.*

This timing is the defining feature. **It works exactly like Devolve** — an interrupt-speed ability that fires between actions, not on your turn. At 0 Power, you can sacrifice your High Priest, gain 2 Power, and take another action immediately. Other players cannot stop this.

### Cultists vs. Acolytes — The Rules Distinction

This is the most rules-lawyery part of High Priest. The expansion manual uses "Cultist" as the broader term and "Acolyte" as the specific term for your standard cultist units. High Priests are Cultists but are **not** Acolytes.

**Spellbooks and abilities that affect only Acolytes — NOT High Priests:**

| Ability | Faction | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Zyngaya | Yellow Sign | Cannot Zyngaya a High Priest |
| Dreams | Great Cthulhu | Can only steal Acolytes, not High Priests |
| Psychosis | Crawling Chaos | Can only place Acolytes |

**Spellbooks that affect all Cultists — including High Priests:**

| Ability | Faction | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Groth | Black Goat | Hits ALL Cultists — be careful if using Groth with your own High Priest on the board |

If you play Black Goat with the High Priest expansion, consider timing Groth to avoid sacrificing your own High Priest when you need it.

## How High Priests Change Opening Turns

The single biggest impact of the High Priest expansion is on **Action Phases 1 through 3**. The script is substantially rewritten for factions with expensive Great Old Ones.

### Crawling Chaos — Example Round 1 Sequence

Without High Priest, Crawling Chaos often spends Round 1 on expansion and has to delay Nyarlathotep. With a High Priest:

1. Move (7 Power remaining)
2. Build Gate in a remote area (4 Power remaining)
3. Summon Night Gaunt at the new Gate (3 Power remaining)
4. Recruit High Priest at starting Gate (0 Power remaining)

**Result:** 2 Gates + 7 Cultists (6 Acolytes + 1 High Priest) = **11 Power** entering Action Phase 2, versus the typical 10.

In Action Phase 2, you can awaken Nyarlathotep and still have enough Power to use Thousand Forms, or sacrifice the High Priest for 2 Power and take additional actions. Popping the High Priest before awakening Nyarlathotep also brings you to 13 Power — which can unlock a Spellbook.

### Great Cthulhu — Example Round 1 Sequence

1. Move toward the ocean (7 Power remaining)
2. Build Gate in an ocean area (4 Power remaining)
3. Summon a Deep One (3 Power remaining)
4. Recruit High Priest at starting Gate (0 Power remaining)

In Action Phase 2, you have enough Power to awaken Cthulhu, immediately Submerge, re-emerge, and potentially fight for a combat Spellbook — all in one action phase.

The general principle applies to **any faction with a costly Great Old One**: recruiting a High Priest in Round 1 lets you enter Action Phase 2 with 11 Power instead of 10, which often means the difference between awakening your GOO on AP2 versus having to wait.

## When to Recruit a High Priest

**1. After a strong previous action phase** — If you have the highest or one of the highest Power levels at the table, spending 3 Power to recruit is low-risk. You can absorb the cost and will benefit from the extra Gather Power.

**2. When you want gate security at low Power** — Even if recruiting the High Priest leaves you with 0 or 1 Power, you have not gone passive. You can sacrifice it at instant speed if someone moves to capture your Gates. The threat of the Unspeakable Oath is itself a deterrent.

**3. As a 7th Acolyte for remote Gates** — If you have conquered or stumbled into a Gate but have no Acolytes nearby, you can recruit a High Priest directly there (as long as you have any unit in the area). It will control that Gate as effectively as any standard Acolyte.

## Advanced Techniques

### The Teleport

Because the Unspeakable Oath returns the High Priest to your pool (not the board), you can use this to effectively move it across the map for free:

1. Your High Priest is sitting safely at a defended Gate
2. You fight your way to a remote abandoned Gate
3. Sacrifice the High Priest for 2 Power → it returns to your pool
4. Recruit it directly at the newly captured Gate (as long as you have a unit there)

You spend 3 Power to re-recruit, but net only –1 Power while placing it anywhere you have a unit, without paying movement costs. This is especially strong late in the game when moving units across a crowded board is expensive.

### The Stall Loop

The least glamorous but occasionally useful trick: if you have nothing productive to do with your Power and want to stay active in the action phase, you can cycle the High Priest indefinitely.

- Recruit for 3 Power
- Sacrifice for 2 Power (net: –1 Power, 1 action consumed)
- Recruit again for 3 Power

Each cycle costs 1 Power and takes 2 actions. This keeps you present and threatening at the end of the action phase without committing to anything specific. Not efficient, but occasionally the right play when you want to deny opponents the "last action" window.

## Should Your Group Add High Priests?

### Pros

- Low rules overhead — if you have played Tcho-Tcho, you already know how they work
- Adds meaningful decisions to every action phase without adding much time
- Makes gate defense more dynamic — the instant-speed pop is a genuine deterrent
- Changes opening strategies in interesting ways for most factions
- Gives all factions access to a 7th potential Power source

### Cons and Caveats

**Slightly weakens Tcho-Tcho.** One of Tcho-Tcho's distinctive features is exclusive access to High Priests. When every faction gets one, that uniqueness is diluted.

**Weakens the Sleeper's Lethargy.** Lethargy's core value is taking the last action while opponents are at 0 Power. With High Priests available, being at 0 Power no longer means being helpless. Opponents can pop for 2 Power and react to whatever Sleeper does with Lethargy.

**Adds a small amount of decision time.** At the end of each action phase, when everyone has run out of Power, there is a potential "do you want to pop?" moment. Running it like an auction — "going once, going twice" — keeps it moving.

**House rule recommended: Crawling Chaos + Thousand Forms.** The host recommends that Crawling Chaos cannot sacrifice their High Priest at 0 Power and then immediately use Thousand Forms. The interaction is legal by the rules, but allows CC to generate a Power swing (potentially 5–7 Power) that no one at 0 Power can respond to. If your group plays with High Priests, consider adding this restriction.

### Verdict

High Priest is one of the lightest expansions to add to Cthulhu Wars. It is best introduced after your group is comfortable with the base game, and it adds the most value when vanilla Earth is starting to feel predictable. The strategic depth it adds — gate security decisions, opening line revisions, the teleport trick — outweighs the minor increase in action phase runtime.
