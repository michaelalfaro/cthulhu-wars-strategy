## Official Resources

### Rulebook

The **Omega Master Rulebook** is the definitive rules reference for Cthulhu Wars, maintained by Petersen Games on their support portal. It supersedes all previous printed rulebooks and resolves long-standing rule disputes from earlier printings.

- [Omega Master Rulebook (single-page layout)](https://petersengames.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48001250498) — PDF, best for on-screen reading and searching
- [Omega Master Rulebook (booklet layout)](https://petersengames.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48001250499) — PDF, best for printing as a booklet
- [Petersen Games website](https://petersengames.com/cthulhu-wars/) — all expansions, maps, and neutral unit packs

> **Note:** The DOCX rulebook previously hosted on BGG is now obsolete. Use the Omega Master Rulebook above for the most current rules.

### Sandy Petersen's Strategy Articles

The game's designer wrote faction strategy articles published on BGG. The Opening the Way podcast host called them resources that "really changed the way I think about the game." Free to read (BGG account may be required).
