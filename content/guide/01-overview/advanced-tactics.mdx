# Intermediate & Advanced Tactics

This guide is aimed at players who have roughly 10 to 20 games under their belt and understand the basics of every faction. If you are still learning the fundamentals, start with the beginner overview and come back here once the core mechanics feel natural. Everything below revisits the same phases and actions covered in the basics, but examines them through a more strategic lens.

---

## 1. Power Management

### The Hidden Resource: Time

Power, units, and Doom are the obvious resources in Cthulhu Wars. The hidden resource that never appears on any card is **time**. Spending your Power slowly across the Action Phase is one of the strongest habits you can develop.

This does not mean taking a long time to think through each decision. If analysis paralysis is a problem at your table, use a timer to keep things moving. What it means is stretching your Power across as many individual actions as possible rather than committing it all at once.

### The 1-Cost Action Philosophy

The backbone of advanced play is the 1-cost action. Moving a single unit, recruiting an Acolyte, using a faction ability that costs 1 Power — these actions keep you participating in the round while your opponents burn through their Power pools. When an opponent spends 3 Power on a Gate or 2 on a monster summon while you spend 1, the gap between your remaining Power and theirs grows every single action.

The practical consequence is that you can manufacture a window of uncontested play at the end of the Action Phase. If you are 4 Power ahead of the table and everyone is taking 1-cost actions, you will have 4 Power left when everyone else passes. Those final actions happen in a vacuum where no one can respond.

### Power Stalling

When you begin an Action Phase with more Power than the other players, your primary goal should be to **maintain that differential** for as long as possible. Take the cheapest actions available until you are forced to do otherwise.

Consider this scenario: you are Black Goat sitting on 12 Power while every other player sits at 8. If everyone takes 1-cost actions in sequence, you will have 4 Power remaining when the table runs out. In that window, you can build a Gate, reposition your Avatar, collect Spellbook requirements — anything you want — with zero ability for opponents to stop you. Meanwhile, if you had built a Gate on your very first action, you broadcast your plan and gave every opponent a chance to adjust before you spent the rest of your Power.

Savvy opponents will recognize you are stalling and stall right back. That is fine. Good players should be doing exactly that. Even a symmetrical stall benefits the player with more Power, because they will still be the last one standing with actions to take.

### Spending Efficiently

Power efficiency is not just about choosing cheap actions. It is about avoiding situations where you spend Power on things that do not move your game plan forward. Every point of Power you spend should either (a) improve your position directly or (b) worsen someone else's position. Power spent on battles with no strategic target, on moving units that did not need to move, or on summoning monsters before you have the Spellbooks to make them useful is Power you will not have at the end of the phase when it matters most.

## 2. Gate Economy

### How Many Gates Is Enough?

Not every game demands five Gates to win. Here is a practical framework:

- **Zero Gates** is catastrophic. Avoid this at nearly any cost. You generate no Power and become irrelevant.
- **One Gate** is survivable but uncomfortable. You are capped at roughly 8 Power per round, which constrains everything you can do and prevents meaningful rituals.
- **Two Gates** is more viable than most players assume. In a tight, contested game where everyone is fighting over the same Gates, 10 Power per round is enough to work with — especially if you are stalling efficiently and picking your battles.
- **Three Gates** is actively strong. At 12 Power with a Great Old One, you can afford most Ritual costs and still have Power left over to act. If you can end a round on three Gates, that is a position to feel good about.
- **Four or Five Gates** puts you in winning range but also paints an enormous target on your back. Push for these numbers only when you are ready to close out the game.

Some factions are dangerous even on two Gates. Windwalker and Yellow Sign generate enough value from their abilities and Spellbooks that two Gates can be sufficient to snowball a win. Do not let those factions sit comfortably at two Gates without pressure.

### The Steal vs. Build Calculus

Building a Gate costs 3 Power and does not pay for itself until the second subsequent Gather Power Phase. You spend 3, collect 2 on the next Gather Power, and only break even after collecting 2 more on the Gather after that — assuming nothing bad happens in between. If the Gate gets taken before you recoup the investment, you lost Power on the deal.

Capturing a Gate from another player costs only 1 Power (just the capture action, after your unit is already in the area), compared to 3 Power to build one from scratch. Beyond the raw cost difference, stealing a Gate denies the opponent 2 Power per round while gaining you 2 Power per round — a 4-Power swing every single Gather Power Phase. Even accounting for the battle cost to clear the area, stealing is almost always more efficient than building.

This is why aggression tends to pay off even if it generates ill will at the table. Being passive and building new Gates while opponents do the same is a slower path than taking the Gates they have already built.

### Reading the Resource Level of the Game

Pay attention early to whether your particular game is trending high-resource or low-resource.

In a **high-resource game**, players build multiple Gates aggressively, Power totals climb quickly, and Great Old Ones hit the board early. Your strategy should include building Gates and ramping your own engine.

In a **low-resource game**, players fight constantly over a small number of Gates, Power stays low across the board, and nobody has the luxury of building freely. In this environment, the Opener faction may never complete its sixth Spellbook because no one is building the Gates it needs. Adjust your Spellbook targets and Gate ambitions to match what is actually happening at the table, and be prepared for the game type to shift mid-game as player fortunes change.

### Defending Your Gates

There is more than one way to defend a Gate, and you do not always need an expensive monster or Great Old One sitting on every one of them.

Consider the cost your opponent must pay to take a Gate from you. If you have a lone Acolyte, an opponent can move a monster in (1 Power) and capture (1 Power) for a total of 2 Power. That is uncomfortable but doable.

Now consider stacking two Acolytes on a Gate. The opponent still needs to enter and battle before capturing. Clearing two Acolytes plus the capture now approaches 3 Power total — nearly what it costs to build an entirely new Gate. Three Acolytes on a Gate costs around 4 Power to take. Most opponents will look for an easier target.

Stacking Acolytes also provides an incidental benefit: it defeats Cthulhu's Dreams. Dreams subverts a single Cultist; multiple Acolytes on a Gate mean Dreams cannot steal it outright in one action. That is a deterrent worth having, especially in games where Cthulhu is at the table.

The key question when defending any Gate is: does my opponent actually have the Power to reach me and take it? If they are nearly out of Power, a single Acolyte is often all the defense you need. Overloading a Gate with expensive units when the opponent cannot threaten it is wasteful deployment.

## 3. Combat Deep Dive

### Fight for a Reason

Power is too valuable to waste on pointless battles. Before declaring any battle, ask yourself what the concrete objective is. If two random monsters are sitting in an area with no Gate and no Great Old One, there is almost no reason to fight there. Reserve your battles for areas with meaningful targets: Gates you want to capture, Great Old Ones you want to eliminate, or board positions you need to deny.

A battle with no Gate or high-value unit at stake is just burning Power and dice on both sides for no structural gain. Factions that fight pointlessly in the early Action Phase often find themselves Power-starved when the battles that actually matter come up.

### Dice Math and Safe Battles

The Cthulhu Wars battle die has three blank faces, two Pain faces, and one Kill face. That means a 1-in-6 chance of a Kill and a 1-in-3 chance of a Pain per die.

You are never guaranteed kills. Rolling 10 dice gives you a statistically reasonable chance of landing a couple of Kills, but dice have a way of punishing assumptions. If you need to eliminate one high-value target like an enemy Great Old One, bring enough dice to make success likely rather than merely possible. Eight to ten dice is a starting point for going after a single target; more is better.

A useful rule of thumb for protecting your own expensive units: for every five dice in the battle, bring one extra body as a Pain soak. Cheap Acolytes absorbing Pain results means your Great Old One survives to fight again rather than being Pained into a bad position.

### Pain as Free Movement

This is one of the most important intermediate-level concepts in the game, and it has a significant caveat: **this only applies when Crawling Chaos's Madness is not in play**. Madness redirects Pained units to areas the Crawling Chaos player controls, which converts your free movement into your opponent's gain. If Crawling Chaos is at the table and has Madness available, adjust accordingly.

Assuming no Madness: a Pain result is not punishment. It is **free movement**. When your unit takes a Pain, you choose which adjacent area it retreats to. You can engineer battles specifically so that your key units get Pained toward your next objective, saving you the Power that a normal move would cost.

Practical example: your Great Old One enters a battle alongside two Acolytes as ablative protection. The Acolytes absorb Kill results. Your Great Old One takes a Pain and retreats into an adjacent area where a different opponent has an undefended Gate. You just moved your Great Old One for free, positioning it for a capture next action without spending movement Power.

This transforms how you think about combat. Battles are not just exchanges of force — they are also repositioning tools.

### The Train of Pain Trick

Once a faction unlocks unlimited battle (available to several factions through their Spellbooks), Pain chains become devastating. The sequence works like this:

1. Declare battle in Area A against one opponent.
2. Take a Pain result and choose to retreat into Area B, where a second opponent has units or a Gate.
3. Immediately declare battle in Area B because your battles are unlimited.
4. Take another Pain into Area C and declare battle there.

A Windwalker death ball or a Cthulhu army can fight two or three different opponents in a single Action Phase turn using this chain. The attacking player spends only the initial move and battle Power; every subsequent engagement costs nothing beyond the original play because Pain movement is free.

The strategic implications are severe. A single combat can cascade into a map-wide rampage that wipes Gates, kills Great Old Ones, and repositions the attacker's forces simultaneously. If you know an opponent has unlimited battle, be very conscious of which areas you are adjacent to when you allow a battle — you might be setting up their next free move into your territory.

If you are using the Train of Pain yourself, plan your Pain retreats before you declare the first battle. Know where you want to land after each exchange, and make sure the areas you are chaining into have enough of your own units or enough opponent vulnerability to make each fight worthwhile.

## 4. Tempo and Initiative

### First Player Advantages

The first player position in Cthulhu Wars is not just about acting first in the Action Phase. It is about controlling the direction of play during the Doom Phase and, critically, setting up who acts before or after vulnerable players.

The directional choice (clockwise or counterclockwise play order) can be used to create specific sequencing advantages:

- If a player is in a vulnerable position and you are not their ally, setting play order so the player most capable of punishing them acts immediately before them gives them no opportunity to shore up defenses in response.
- Late in a game when multiple players are chaining Rituals of Annihilation, the right turn order can literally deny someone a Ritual. If a player gets attacked before their turn, loses Gates, and suddenly cannot afford the Ritual cost they were planning on, you have effectively stolen Doom from them without spending any of your own Power.

These are small edges, but in a close game they accumulate.

### When to Pass

Knowing when to stop acting is as important as knowing what to do. If you have clearly accomplished your objectives for the phase and still have Power remaining, consider whether any additional actions serve your plan or just burn resources and signal information to opponents.

Passing with Power remaining is sometimes the right call. If you have accomplished everything meaningful and all remaining options are minor or risky, saving your Power for the next phase's Gather or ending with units well positioned may be better than chasing marginal gains.

### Forcing Opponents to Act First

When you have a Power advantage and stall with 1-cost actions, you force opponents into a dilemma every time their turn comes around. They can:

1. **Stall with you** — which maintains the gap, because you have more Power and will outlast them anyway.
2. **Make expensive plays** — which spends their Power faster and increases the gap.

Either choice benefits you. The player with superior Power and a commitment to stalling sits in a dominant position throughout the Action Phase. The goal is to reach the end of the phase with opponents having made their decisions first, leaving you to act with full information and no opposition.

### The Value of Reactive Play

Reactive play — waiting to see what opponents do before committing your own Power — is consistently undervalued by intermediate players. When you commit Power early, you give opponents the ability to react to your plans. When you wait, they have to commit to their plans without knowing yours.

This is especially valuable for expensive plays. If you are planning to build a Gate, awaken your Great Old One, or summon a powerful monster, doing it as late in the Action Phase as possible means opponents cannot spend their remaining Power to counter you. They have already committed.

## 5. Spellbook Prioritization

### Match Books to Your Board State

When you unlock a Spellbook, choose one that corresponds to what is already happening on the board. A Spellbook that enhances a monster you have not summoned and do not plan to summon is a wasted unlock.

A specific example from the episode: if you are playing Cthulhu and have no Shoggoths on the board, do not take Absorb. Absorb does nothing without Shoggoths. Wait to pick it up as your last book, and by then you will likely have the board state to make it relevant. Taking it early just means one of your six slots is occupied by a book that sits unused.

The general principle: your Spellbook unlocks should trace a coherent progression of your faction's capabilities. Each book you take should either be immediately useful or unlock something you are actively building toward.

### Early Books vs. Late Books

Think of your Spellbook sequence as a roadmap. Early books should do one of two things: either enable a core part of your engine that pays dividends over the whole game, or satisfy the unlock condition requirements that gate your most powerful late-game books.

Late books can be more situational. Once your core engine is running, you have the flexibility to pick up books that enhance specific situations — the powerful ability that only matters in certain matchups, the upgrade to an expensive monster you can finally afford to summon, or the book that is uniquely useful in this particular game's configuration.

Avoid taking late-game books early just because the opportunity to unlock one presents itself. If the unlock condition fires but the book itself adds nothing to your current position, wait and take a more immediately impactful book instead.

### Unlock Conditions as a Roadmap

Many Spellbook unlock conditions are not just arbitrary hurdles — they reflect the natural progression of your faction's strategy. If a book unlocks when you control three Gates, that signals the book is designed for a board state where you have established territory. If a book unlocks when you have two Great Old Ones in play, it is a late-game power amplifier.

Reading your unlock conditions tells you the game plan your faction's designer intended. Following that roadmap, with situational deviations when the game demands it, is a solid foundation for Spellbook sequencing.

### Awakening Your Great Old One: Early vs. Delayed

Most factions awaken their Great Old One in Action Phase 2. Roughly 85 percent of the time, this is the correct play. The Great Old One provides combat power, Spellbook unlock conditions, and often enables key faction abilities.

That leaves a 10 to 15 percent window where deliberately delaying your Great Old One can be profitable. If you skip awakening on turn 2, you have that Power to spend on expansion: building or stealing Gates, recruiting, advancing Spellbook conditions. The following turn, you awaken your Great Old One with more Gates, more Power, and a stronger board position than if you had awakened on turn 2.

Yellow Sign is a good illustration. Awakening Hastur on turn 2 is strong. But sometimes building one or two extra Gates first and awakening Hastur on turn 3 with 4 Power still in reserve puts you in a better overall position — more Doom from Gates, more Power to spend, and Hastur still comes online.

## 6. Doom Phase Strategy

### When to Ritual

The Ritual of Annihilation is how you convert a board advantage into a winning Doom score, but timing it poorly can hand the game to someone else. The conditions where Ritual makes clear sense:

- **You have all six Spellbooks.** This is non-negotiable. Ending the game without your full complement of Spellbooks is the single worst outcome in Cthulhu Wars. Get your books first, then accelerate the Doom clock.
- **You are on three or more Gates with at least one Great Old One.** At three Gates, a Ritual generates at least 3 Doom from Gates plus the Ritual result itself plus a likely Elder Sign, totalling a 6 to 8 Doom swing in a single turn. That is substantial.
- **You are at or above 20 Doom and within striking distance of 30.** Once you can see the finish line clearly, Ritual becomes your priority.

### When Not to Ritual

It can be tempting to Ritual when sitting on four Gates and 14 Power, but consider what you are giving up. Ritual costs Power. That Power could instead be spent on actions that compound your advantage further.

If you have more Power than all opponents, spending that Power to outlast them in the Action Phase may produce more value than the Doom from a Ritual. Specifically:

- Opponents who run out of Power before you cannot defend their Gates. You can expand your own Gate count for free at the end of the phase.
- You can snipe opposing Great Old Ones so they enter the next Action Phase with weakened forces and reduced combat capability.
- You avoid putting a target on your back that would cause every opponent to cooperate against you.

A Ritual signals that you are ahead and making a move toward winning. Sometimes staying below the radar and consolidating power quietly sets up a later turn where you Ritual from an unassailable position. The Doom gained from one early Ritual is rarely worth the political attention it attracts if your position is already dominant.

### The Elder Sign Gamble

The Elder Sign provides a large bonus when you Ritual, but it is a gamble. Rolling well on the Elder Sign check when you have multiple Great Old Ones and Gates is excellent. Rolling poorly when you needed that Doom to close out the game is painful.

The practical advice: when you are well ahead in Doom and can afford some variance, the Elder Sign gamble is low-risk because even a bad result leaves you ahead. When you are in a close race and need a specific Doom outcome to win, be more conservative and consider whether the Power spent on Ritual is better deployed extending your board advantage.

### Reading the Doom Track

Monitor not just your own Doom but everyone else's trajectory. The Doom track tells you who is approaching the winning threshold and how many turns remain. If an opponent is at 22 Doom with all six Spellbooks and three Gates, they are one or two turns from winning. That changes every decision on the table.

When someone gets within striking distance of 30, the entire dynamic of the game shifts. Every player needs to evaluate whether they can win before that player closes it out, or whether cooperative pressure on the leader is necessary to extend the game.

## 7. The Half-Power Safety Net

### How It Works

When a player is reduced to zero units on the board — completely wiped out — they receive enough Power at the start of the next Gather Power Phase to maintain a functional position: specifically, they receive Power equal to half the normal starting amount (rounded as specified in the rules), which is enough to begin rebuilding. This prevents a single devastating board wipe from permanently eliminating a player from competition.

The mechanic exists to keep the game fair and engaging even after catastrophic turns. A player who loses everything is not permanently crippled — they can rebuild from the safety net.

### When It Triggers

The safety net triggers after a complete board wipe. This typically happens when an opponent (or coalition of opponents) uses a combination of combat, captures, and abilities to eliminate every single unit a player has on the board.

This is rare but not impossible. Factions with strong combat capability and unlimited battle — Windwalker, Cthulhu — are best positioned to engineer a board wipe. The Train of Pain trick, chaining battles across multiple areas, can sweep an entire player's presence off the board in a single Action Phase.

### Exploiting It Against Devastated Players

Understanding the half-power safety net changes how you approach board-wiping an opponent. If you devastate a player enough that they trigger the net, they will rebuild — but slowly. In the turns immediately after a board wipe, a recovering player has limited Power, no or minimal Gates, and no Great Old One on the board.

This window of vulnerability is where you press the advantage. Do not let a recovering player rebuild unchallenged. Use your Power advantage to steal any Gates they re-establish before they become self-sustaining again. A player who just rebuilt to two Acolytes and one Gate is not a threat yet; a player who rebuilds to three Gates and their Great Old One is dangerous again.

Conversely, if you are the player who has been devastated, understand that the safety net buys you time but not security. Your immediate priority is Gate establishment and Great Old One awakening, in that order. Without Gates, you cannot generate meaningful Power. Without your Great Old One, you cannot project force or defend what you build.

---

## 8. Pool Management

### The Value of Units in Pool

Most players instinctively try to keep every unit on the board at all times. Experienced players recognize that **having one or two Acolytes in your pool is actively useful**.

An Acolyte in your pool can be recruited to any area where you already have a unit present. This means if your Great Old One fights its way to a remote part of the map, you can recruit an Acolyte directly at that location for 1 Power rather than spending multiple Power to walk one across several areas. A unit that is already where you need it, even if it costs 1 Power to recruit, is better than a unit that needs two or three moves to get there.

Pool recycling can also be intentional. If an Acolyte is going to get captured anyway, having it captured somewhere inconvenient for you and then recruiting it adjacent to where you actually want it next turn is a net efficiency gain. It arrived for free (via capture) and deploys for 1 Power (via recruit) instead of costing you movement Power for each area traversed.

### Factions with Natural Pool Cycling

Some factions have built-in mechanisms that move units in and out of the pool:

- **Black Goat** uses Blood Sacrifice to convert Acolytes into Power, deliberately placing them in the pool.
- **Cthulhu** uses Absorb to devour Acolytes and Devolve to return units to the pool.

For these factions, pool management is a core part of the engine, not an afterthought. Understanding the flow of units through the pool — when they go in, when they come out, and where they should be recruited — is essential to playing these factions well.

### Keeping Reserve vs. Deploying Everything

There is a tension between keeping units in reserve (in the pool, available for flexible deployment) and deploying everything to maximize Gather Power Phase income. This is not a tension with a single right answer; it depends on the game state.

In general:
- Deploy everything at the end of each Action Phase if you can, to maximize Power generation. Every Acolyte on a Gate generates 1 Power; an Acolyte in the pool generates nothing.
- During the Action Phase, however, maintaining one or two Acolytes in the pool gives you flexibility to respond to board developments with recruitment rather than movement.

The key is that pool management during the Action Phase is a tool. End-of-phase deployment is a discipline. Maintain the former, enforce the latter.

---

## 9. Threat Assessment

### Evaluating the Leader

The most dangerous player at the table is not always the one with the most Gates or the highest Doom. It is the player closest to a self-sustaining position with a clear path to completing their Spellbooks. Learn to evaluate threats based on **trajectory**, not just current standing.

A player on two Gates with five Spellbooks, a Great Old One in play, and a clear unlock condition for their sixth book is more dangerous than a player on four Gates with three Spellbooks and enemies closing in from all sides. The second player's position looks stronger on paper but is less sustainable.

### Identifying the Runaway Leader

A runaway victory occurs when one player builds an advantage so quickly that no one else can catch up before they hit 30 Doom. The warning signs:

- Three or more Gates with no credible opposition to threaten any of them.
- All six Spellbooks completed while others are still on four or five.
- A Great Old One with unlimited battle and a strong board position heading into an Action Phase.
- Doom scores diverging significantly from the rest of the table with several rounds remaining.

When one player shows multiple simultaneous warning signs, collective action is usually required. The cost of cooperation against a leader is accepting a suboptimal turn for yourself; the cost of ignoring the leader is losing to them.

### Preventing Snowballs

Cthulhu Wars rewards building on success. A player who wins a key battle gains board position, which enables them to generate more Power, which enables more battles. Preventing this snowball requires identifying inflection points — moments where one player's advantage is about to compound — and intervening before it becomes unassailable.

The best time to attack the leader is before they are fully established, not after. An opponent on three Gates is much easier to contest than an opponent on five Gates with their full faction engine running.

---

## 10. Intermediate Mistakes

### Spending Power Too Fast

The single most common intermediate mistake is dumping Power into expensive actions early in the Action Phase. Building a Gate on your first action, summoning your most expensive monster before anyone else has spent significant Power, or awakening your Great Old One the moment the phase starts — all of these announce your plans and give every opponent maximum time to react.

Stall first, commit later. Do cheap actions until you are forced to do otherwise, or until doing so costs you more than it saves.

### Over-Defending Gates

Parking a Great Old One, a monster, and multiple Acolytes on every Gate sounds safe but immobilizes your forces and prevents you from generating value elsewhere on the board. Evaluate what your opponents can actually threaten given their current Power. If they lack the Power to reach you this phase, a lone Acolyte on the Gate is sufficient. Redeploy your combat units where they can generate board impact.

### Ignoring the Doom Track

Some players become so absorbed in the tactical game of fighting over Gates and winning battles that they forget the game is won on Doom points. Gates and combat are means to an end. If you are winning every battle but never performing Rituals, you are not winning the game. Track everyone's Doom total actively throughout each round.

### Ritualing Without Spellbooks

Performing Rituals aggressively before you have all six Spellbooks accelerates the game clock toward an end state where you will be underperforming your potential. Every Ritual means the game is one turn closer to ending. If the game ends and you are missing even one Spellbook, you have left Doom on the table. Get your Spellbooks first, then turn on the Doom engine.

### Taking Irrelevant Spellbooks

Choosing a Spellbook that has no immediate application on the board wastes an unlock. If the book enhances a monster you have not summoned and do not plan to summon this game, pick something else. You can always take the situational book last, when you may finally have the board state to use it. Taking it early means one of your six slots is occupied by dead weight.

The specific example from the podcast: do not take Absorb as Cthulhu if you have no Shoggoths in play. Wait until your last book unlock. If you get there and still have no Shoggoths, at least you have five other books that were actually contributing.

### Fighting Pointless Battles

Declaring battle in areas with no strategic value burns Power and dice for nothing. Every battle should have a concrete objective: capture a Gate, eliminate a Great Old One, set up a Pain chain into a valuable position, or deny an opponent a key area. Battles fought just to trade units in an irrelevant area are a waste that will cost you when the meaningful fights arrive.

### Misreading Pain Results

New and intermediate players often treat Pain results as a near-miss or partial success. Experienced players treat them as free movement opportunities. The difference in how you construct your battles — what units you bring, which adjacent areas you want to land in — is substantial once you internalize that Pain is relocation, not failure.

Remember the caveat: this only applies cleanly when Crawling Chaos's Madness is absent. If Madness is in play, Pained units do not go where you choose. Account for this when Crawling Chaos is at the table.
