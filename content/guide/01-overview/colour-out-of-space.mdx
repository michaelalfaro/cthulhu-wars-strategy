# The Colour Out of Space

## Overview

The Colour Out of Space is an official variant designed by Sandy Petersen himself, originally released as a rules supplement for the colored gates sent to backers of the Onslaught Two Kickstarter campaign. Rather than leaving the faction-colored gates as purely cosmetic components, Petersen wrote a set of rules that turn them into a gameplay expansion -- one that introduces unpredictable Doom Phase effects tied to which Colour Gates players control.

The variant does not overhaul the core game. Movement, combat, Spellbooks, and action economy all remain unchanged. What it does is layer a new risk-reward decision onto every gate you build: do you place a standard gate for predictable returns, or gamble on a Colour Gate that could grant you bonus Elder Signs, extra Power, or Doom -- but might also deny you a Ritual, kill your own units, or hand an advantage to an opponent? The result is a game that feels familiar in structure but plays differently in practice, because the Doom Phase is no longer a routine scoring step. It becomes a moment of tension where a single die roll can reshape the round's outcome.

## Components

To play, you need the Colour Gates -- plastic gates in each faction's color. These were originally part of the Onslaught Two rewards and later packaged together with the Plastic Gates pack as the **Eldritch Gate Pack**. The set includes gates in eight faction colors (Great Cthulhu, Black Goat, Crawling Chaos, Yellow Sign, Opener of the Way, Sleeper, Windwalker, and Tcho-Tcho), plus an Ancients-colored gate (added with Onslaught Three) and a glow-in-the-dark gate. You also need one standard six-sided die for the Doom Phase roll.

## Rules Changes

### Creating Colour Gates

Whenever any player takes the Create Gate action (costing the usual 3 Power), they may choose to place either a **normal gate** or any **available Colour Gate** from the pool. The critical detail: you are not restricted to your own faction's color. Crawling Chaos can build a red gate, Yellow Sign can build a blue gate, and so on. The choice of which Colour Gate to place is a strategic decision, because each color produces different effects depending on the die roll.

The **glow-in-the-dark gate** has one additional restriction: you can only create the Glow Gate if you already control another Colour Gate. It serves as a reward for players who commit to the variant's mechanics rather than playing conservatively with normal gates.

### The Doom Phase Die Roll

At the start of each Doom Phase -- before anyone scores Doom or performs Rituals -- one player rolls a single d6. The result determines which effect column is active for that Doom Phase. Every Colour Gate on the board then resolves its effect based on its color and the rolled result. The six outcomes are:

| Roll | Result | General Effect |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | **Meteorite** | Forced Colour Gate distribution |
| 2 | **Fertility** | Mixed benefits -- Elder Signs, kills, or Doom loss |
| 3 | **Feasting** | Power shifts and Ritual bonuses |
| 4 | **Madness** | Power shifts, Ritual blocks, and unit kills |
| 5 | **Blight** | Overwhelmingly negative -- Power loss, Ritual blocks, unit elimination |
| 6 | **Departure** | Colour Gate removal by the losing player |

### Effect Details by Result

**Meteorite (1):** Beginning with the Starting Player and continuing in turn order, the first player who does not control a Colour Gate must select one from the pool (if available) and replace one of their normal gates with it. This is the variant's distribution mechanic -- it ensures Colour Gates spread across the table rather than concentrating with one player. If you have been avoiding Colour Gates, Meteorite forces you into the system.

**Fertility (2):** Effects vary by gate color. Some grant an extra Elder Sign if the controller performs a Ritual of Annihilation. Others kill the lowest-cost enemy Monster or Cultist at the gate. Some colors impose a Doom penalty of -1. This is a mixed result where some colors benefit significantly and others suffer.

**Feasting (3):** A spread of Power adjustments and Ritual bonuses. Some colors grant +1 Power, others impose -1 Power. Certain colors award an extra Elder Sign on Ritual, while others penalize Doom by -1. This result rewards players who chose their gate colors wisely.

**Madness (4):** A volatile result. Effects include Power gains and losses, Ritual blocks (preventing you from performing a Ritual of Annihilation at all this Doom Phase), Doom gains or losses, and forced kills on your own units at the gate. Madness is where the variant shows its teeth -- a Ritual block on a round when you planned a big scoring push can be devastating.

**Blight (5):** The most punishing result overall. Multiple colors suffer Power loss, Ritual blocks, Doom loss, or forced elimination of one of your own units at the gate. Blight is the nightmare scenario for Colour Gate holders, and it is the main reason why the variant introduces genuine risk alongside its rewards.

**Departure (6):** The player with the lowest Doom total may select any one Colour Gate on the map and replace it with a normal gate. This is a catch-up mechanic that gives trailing players the ability to strip a Colour Gate from a leader who has been benefiting from it. It also provides an escape hatch -- if you are stuck with a Colour Gate that keeps hurting you, Departure lets you or another low-Doom player remove it.

### Gate Replacement Rule

In addition to the Meteorite result, there is a standing replacement rule: beginning with the Starting Player and continuing in turn order, the first player who does not control a Colour Gate must select one from the pool and replace a normal gate with it. This ensures that Colour Gates cycle through the game and no player can entirely opt out of the variant once it is in play.

## Strategy Implications

The Colour Out of Space transforms gate-building from a purely economic calculation into a gamble with faction-specific upside. In the base game, every gate is identical -- 3 Power to build, 2 Power income, 1 Doom per round, doubled on Ritual. The variant breaks that symmetry. A Colour Gate might be worth more than a normal gate on a good roll or significantly worse on a bad one.

### Risk Assessment

The fundamental strategic question is: **how much variance can you afford?** A player sitting comfortably at 3 gates with a strong board position might welcome the high ceiling of Colour Gate effects -- an extra Elder Sign here, a bonus Power there. A player clinging to 2 gates and fighting for survival cannot afford a Blight roll that kills their units or blocks their Ritual. The variant punishes fragile positions more than it rewards strong ones, because the downside effects (Ritual blocks, unit kills, Doom loss) can cascade into lost tempo.

### Gate Color Selection

Since you can build any available Colour Gate regardless of your faction, choosing which color to place is a meaningful decision. Each color has a different distribution of positive and negative effects across the six die results. Before building, consider:

- **How many results benefit this color vs. how many punish it?** Some colors skew positive (more Elder Signs, more Power) while others carry higher risk.
- **What does this color do on Blight (5)?** Blight is the most consistently punishing result. If a color imposes a Ritual block on Blight, that is a one-in-six chance of losing your entire Ritual scoring for the round.
- **Can you absorb unit elimination?** Colors that force kills on your own units at the gate are more dangerous for factions running lean garrisons and less threatening for factions that flood areas with cheap units.

### Tempo Disruption

Power adjustments from Colour Gates happen at the start of the Doom Phase, which means they modify how much Power you have left for Rituals. A +1 Power on a turn where you are exactly 1 short of a Ritual is enormous. A -1 Power when you had planned to Ritual is a full round's scoring gone. This makes Power management tighter and more uncertain -- you cannot plan Ritual timing with the same confidence as in the base game.

### Ritual Denial

Several color-result combinations outright block Rituals of Annihilation. This is the variant's sharpest edge. In the base game, Rituals are a strategic choice; in Colour Out of Space, they can be denied by a die roll. This means that players who depend heavily on Ritual scoring (especially those racing to 30 Doom) face an additional layer of risk when controlling Colour Gates. Conversely, players who score primarily through gate control and capture economy are less affected by Ritual blocks.

## Faction-by-Faction Impact

### Great Cthulhu

Cthulhu benefits from the variant's chaos. With cheap Deep Ones and Shoggoths to garrison gates, Cthulhu can absorb unit elimination effects better than most factions. Submerge also provides flexibility -- if a gate becomes a liability, Cthulhu can reposition quickly. The risk is that Cthulhu often depends on large Rituals (multiple gates, high Doom) to close out games, and Ritual blocks hit hard when you are trying to score 6+ Doom in a single Doom Phase.

### Black Goat

Black Goat is well-positioned. The faction's ability to flood the board with Fungi means unit elimination effects are less threatening -- losing a 1-cost Fungi at a gate is a minor annoyance, not a disaster. Black Goat's economy is also more resilient to Power fluctuations because of Fertility and the sheer number of Cultists generating income. The main risk is Ritual denial, since Black Goat frequently aims for large Ritual turns when controlling 4+ gates.

### Crawling Chaos

Crawling Chaos has a mixed relationship with the variant. Nyarlathotep's mobility means the faction can react to gate effects quickly, and the faction's strength in combat means it can retake gates disrupted by Colour effects. However, Crawling Chaos tends to run leaner on units than Black Goat, making forced kills more painful. Flight also does not help against Doom Phase effects that trigger automatically. On the positive side, Crawling Chaos benefits from any variant that introduces chaos and asymmetry, since the faction excels at exploiting opponents' misfortune.

### Yellow Sign

Yellow Sign is the faction most threatened by this variant. The King in Yellow's strategy depends on careful Doom accumulation and well-timed Rituals, and Ritual blocks are devastating to a faction that converts Desecration into Doom through precise timing. Yellow Sign also runs fewer expendable units than Black Goat, making elimination effects more costly. The upside is that Yellow Sign's Doom acceleration can sometimes outpace the variant's penalties -- if you are already at 28 Doom, a single bad roll matters less than it does at 15.

### Opener of the Way

Opener benefits from the variant's gate distribution mechanics. The faction wants to control many gates, and Colour Gates do not cost more than normal ones. Yog-Sothoth's ability to place gates in unusual locations means Opener can be selective about which Colour Gates to build and where. The Dragon Ascending and Dragon Descending Spellbooks also provide flexibility to recover from bad Doom Phase rolls. Opener's main vulnerability is the same as always: overextension. Adding Colour Gate risk on top of a wide gate network amplifies the consequences of a bad round.

### Sleeper

Sleeper's defensive posture and Tsathoggua's Power-draining abilities make the faction somewhat resistant to the variant's Power fluctuations. Losing 1 Power from a gate effect matters less when you are already running a tight economy and taxing opponents. The main concern is that Sleeper often builds gates slowly and cannot afford to lose Ritual opportunities -- a Ritual block when you finally have 3 gates and enough Power to Ritual can set you back an entire round.

### Windwalker

Windwalker thrives on disruption and plays well with the variant's chaos. Ithaqua's ability to Hibernate (storing Power between rounds) means Power fluctuations from gate effects are more manageable. The faction also benefits from opponents being destabilized by bad rolls. Windwalker's lean unit composition is a vulnerability against elimination effects, but Gnoph-Keh's combat prowess means the faction can retake lost positions quickly.

### Tcho-Tcho

Tcho-Tcho's swarm of cheap Tcho-Tcho Warriors makes unit elimination effects trivial. Losing a 1-cost unit is barely noticeable. The faction's aggressive playstyle also means Tcho-Tcho care less about Ritual denial in the early game, since they are focused on capturing enemy resources rather than Ritualing. In the late game, Ritual blocks become more dangerous as Tcho-Tcho push for 30 Doom, but by then the faction often has enough momentum to absorb a bad round.

### Ancients

The Ancients have strong synergy with the variant. Their emphasis on map control and area presence means they can garrison gates well, and Cathedrals give them scoring avenues that do not depend entirely on Rituals. The Ancients-colored gate was added in Onslaught Three specifically for this expansion. With their spread-out playstyle, the Ancients can distribute Colour Gate risk across multiple positions rather than concentrating it.

## When to Use This Variant

**Best for experienced groups.** The Colour Out of Space adds complexity and variance. New players are still learning base game tempo and Ritual timing; layering randomized gate effects on top of that can be overwhelming. Wait until everyone at the table is comfortable with the core game before introducing this variant.

**Excellent for adding replayability.** If your group has played enough base games that the Doom Phase feels routine, this variant injects uncertainty and new decision points into a phase that otherwise plays on autopilot.

**Good for 4-5 player games.** With more players, the Colour Gates distribute more widely and the die roll affects more positions simultaneously. In 2-player games, the variant can feel swingy because a single bad roll affects a larger proportion of the total gates in play.

**Consider skipping in tournament or high-stakes games.** The randomness of the die roll can override skill-based play. A well-executed 3-Ritual strategy can be undone by an unlucky Blight or Madness roll. If your group prefers deterministic outcomes, this variant may frustrate more than it entertains.

**Pairs well with expansion factions.** The variant's chaos is easier to manage for factions with flexible economies and cheap units. If you are playing with Black Goat, Tcho-Tcho, or Ancients, the downside risk is more manageable. If the table is all base factions with tight unit pools, expect the variance to hit harder.
