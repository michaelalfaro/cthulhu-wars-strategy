# Threat Assessment & Politics

Episode 13 of Opening the Way covers what host Graham calls the most abstract but possibly most important topic in the entire podcast: threat assessment and table politics. These are the skills that separate good players from great ones, and they operate entirely outside the rulebook.

## Why Politics Matter

Cthulhu Wars runs on three axes of competition: skill, luck, and politics. Chess is pure skill. Mario Kart mixes skill with luck. Cthulhu Wars has all three, and the third axis -- table politics -- has an enormous effect on every single game.

Graham makes this point with a blunt observation: even if you have played hundreds of games and know every faction inside and out, if the other players decide to coordinate against you, there is almost nothing you can do. "If everybody agrees that Black Goat needs to be taken down, there's probably not a lot you can do about it in the end, other than maybe talk about it with the table." The only recourse, notably, is more politics.

In a four-player game, raw probability gives every player a 25% chance to win before a single piece is placed. Every edge you gain beyond that baseline matters. Mechanics and faction knowledge can give you an edge. Smart politics can give you a bigger one. And critically, political skill compounds with mechanical skill -- the best players in the world are those who play well mechanically *and* are savvy table talkers.

The two key failure modes Graham identifies in lopsided games -- even among experienced players -- are:

1. One or more players failed to identify who was actually in the dominant position and did not target them aggressively enough.
2. Players fought each other for arbitrary or territorial reasons without addressing the real threat.

Both failures are political failures. Understanding why helps you avoid them.

## Reading the Doom Track

The Doom track is the most visible measure of where the game stands, but reading it correctly requires more than glancing at raw numbers. Graham breaks down what to actually watch.

**Raw Doom count** is the obvious starting point. If one player is sitting at 15 Doom while everyone else is at 8 or 9, that player is the leader. The immediate question becomes: can they end the round on three, four, or five Gates? If so, the gap becomes nearly impossible to close. The leader's Doom total compounds with each Gate they control at the Ritual of Annihilation.

**Elder Signs are hidden Doom points.** On average, each Elder Sign is worth 1.67 Doom. A player sitting on five to ten Elder Signs -- Yellow Sign in particular can accumulate these quickly -- may be far ahead of what the visible Doom track suggests. Watch the behavior of players holding many Elder Signs. If a player with two or three Elder Signs and one Great Old One rituals on a couple of Gates and lands in the low 20s, you can reasonably infer their Elder Signs are scoring twos and threes. That is a dangerous position.

**Think ahead to end-of-round totals.** As the action phase winds down, run the math: initial Doom plus Ritual Doom plus expected Elder Sign value. If that sum pushes a player to 30 or close to it, you need to act now. Removing their Gates or Great Old Ones before scoring is the mechanism; the politics is coordinating that removal with the other players.

**Ask how many action phases remain.** One? Two? The answer changes the urgency of everything. If a player will reach the high 20s this round but not actually win, you have one more phase to deal with them -- but you need to spend that phase making your case to the table, not just executing your own plans.

## Threat Assessment Framework

Identifying the leader is not always obvious. Graham offers a practical checklist of indicators, each of which should raise your alarm level.

**High raw Doom count.** The simplest signal. A player clearly ahead on the track needs to be treated as the problem, regardless of how they got there.

**Large Elder Sign count.** Particularly relevant for Yellow Sign, who can stockpile Elder Signs in large numbers. When you suspect a player's Elder Signs are scoring high, treat their visible Doom total as an undercount.

**Power differential.** A player who skipped a Ritual and entered the new round with five or six more Power than everyone else is dangerous even if they are not yet leading on Doom. That Power surplus translates directly into extra actions after other players are spent out. Certain factions make this especially frightening -- a Black Goat with a massive Power surplus might simply Ghroth every turn until the board collapses.

**Spellbook progress, specifically unlimited combat.** The first player to complete six Spellbooks and unlock unlimited combat has a significant edge. This is especially true for Cthulhu, who can use unlimited combat to chain battle actions across multiple areas and suppress opponents before they can respond. If someone is one Spellbook away from this, treat them as if they already have it.

**Gate count.** Controlling the most Gates generates the most Doom at the Ritual and signals board dominance. However, being spread across many Gates also means being spread thin -- a player on five Gates is physically closer to more opponents and harder to protect at any given point.

**Does the player have a path to win in the action phase?** If someone is sitting at 27 Doom entering the round, check whether they have any mechanism to reach 30 before the Ritual. Spellbooks, Great Old One special abilities, and faction-specific scoring can all push a player over the line without a single Ritual. Know what those mechanisms are for every faction at the table.

Use all of these indicators together rather than relying on any one. A player at 12 Doom with six Spellbooks, four Gates, and a Power surplus may be a greater threat than a player at 14 Doom who is spread thin and has no combat unlock.

## The Art of Alliance

Cthulhu Wars does not have formal alliance rules. Everything that happens at the political level is informal, unenforceable, and entirely dependent on trust and mutual interest. Graham calls this, borrowing from his mentor Cheshire on Discord, "the Power of Friendship."

The core value proposition of an informal alliance is asymmetric: if you can get another player to do your dirty work for you without spending any of your own Power, that is worth at least 7 to 10 Power in Graham's estimation -- as much as a mid-to-high-cost Ritual. When Great Cthulhu dismantles the Windwalker's position because you talked them into it, you preserved your own units, your own Power, and your own board position. You gained all the benefit of neutralizing a threat at zero cost.

Good times to pursue alliances and favors:

**Early in the game.** Ask whether you can do anyone a favor right away. Yellow Sign can give three Doom to any player as part of a Spellbook requirement -- offering that gift to a specific player and reminding them of it later is a concrete, early-game political investment. Spending a small resource to buy goodwill is almost always worth it.

**When you need to enter someone's territory peacefully.** Yellow Sign needs to Desecrate in specific map areas, which may require moving through someone else's controlled space. Rather than triggering an expensive fight, tell that player explicitly what you are doing and why: you are coming in to Desecrate and then leaving, not to take their Gate. This kind of transparency converts a potential conflict into a non-event and costs nothing.

**When you need your position to remain stable.** If you need an action phase without interference -- to complete a Spellbook requirement, build toward a Ritual, or consolidate a position -- propose a specific, limited non-aggression arrangement. The key word is specific. Do not say "let's both go for a three-Gate opening." That leaves everything else undefined. Crawling Chaos could agree to that and still awaken their Great Old One and come after your Gates in the same phase -- you did not say they could not. Say exactly what you are agreeing to and what you expect in return. Name the phase, name the prohibited actions.

**After a power vacuum opens.** When the two leaders collide and destroy each other's units, every other player should be talking immediately. Who takes the suddenly-empty Gates? How do you coordinate to prevent one of those damaged leaders from recovering? A power vacuum is the best buying opportunity in the game, and the players who talk fastest and coordinate most effectively are the ones who profit from it.

## When to Break an Alliance

Informal alliances in Cthulhu Wars are means to an end, not ends in themselves. Cooperation is optimal until it stops being optimal, and recognizing that inflection point is the final political skill.

Graham is direct about this: there is no permanent safety in an alliance. The goal is always your own win condition. Cooperation buys you time, Power efficiency, and board stability. It does not change the fact that only one player wins.

The practical guidance here is to be as specific as possible when making agreements so both sides know exactly what they committed to -- and when that commitment ends. A deal that says "I won't attack you this action phase" expires naturally. A deal that says "I won't attack you all game" is not a real deal; no experienced player should accept it or offer it.

The endgame is where alliances fracture most cleanly. If you are in second place and the leader is pulling away, your path to victory requires either catching up through Doom scoring or knocking the leader back down. Your former ally in third place has the same calculation. Coordinate with them to suppress the leader, then recognize that once the leader is removed as a threat, the alliance between second and third place has served its purpose.

The meta-political concern is reputation. Graham notes that he plays regularly with the same group of players and consistently keeps his word. Being known as reliable makes other players willing to ally with you, take your warnings seriously, and not preemptively target you. That reputation is a long-term political asset. Breaking a deal to win one game may cost you the political credibility to make deals in future games -- and future games are where the return on reputation is paid out.

## Talking at the Table

Graham's concrete advice on table talk centers on two related behaviors: calling out threats loudly and publicly, and being precise with your own proposals.

**If you see something, say something.** Did someone steal multiple Gates at the start of the game? Say it out loud to the whole table. Is a player sitting on a large Doom lead after a Ritual? Announce it before the next action phase begins: "Everyone needs to know that the Cats just ritualed and now have five or six more Doom than the rest of us. We need to deal with the Cats." Even if the other players can see the Doom track themselves, hearing it stated plainly focuses attention and primes collective action.

**Math it out.** If you can see how a player reaches 30 Doom, walk through the calculation for the table. Doom from the track plus Ritual income plus Elder Signs equals 30. When you present the arithmetic, it becomes hard to dismiss. Players respond to concrete numbers. Even if they ignore you in the moment, you earn credibility for the next warning -- and after the game ends with the player you warned about winning, you take a drink from the glass of "I told you so."

**Claim the moral high ground.** If you are about to attack the leader and you know this will cost you Power and units, announce it. "I want everyone to take note: I'm going after the leader. Don't do anything to me right now because I'm handling the problem." With experienced players, this works. You are taking an action that serves the table. Making that visible invites others to protect you or at least not pile on while you are exposed.

**Be specific in your proposals.** Vague agreements create exploitable ambiguities. Every detail of a proposed arrangement should be named: which action phase it covers, which territories are off-limits, what actions are prohibited. "Let's leave each other alone" is not an agreement. "I will not move into your area this action phase and I will not attack any of your units or Gates" is an agreement.

**Build credible threats, not empty ones.** If you threaten to attack a player unless they do something, make sure it is a threat you could actually carry out and would benefit from. Empty threats are detected quickly and damage your credibility. Credible ones -- backed by your actual board position -- carry real political weight and sometimes accomplish their goal without a single die being rolled.

## Pile-On Dynamics

One of the recurring situations where politics becomes decisive is the coordinated effort to take down the leader. Graham treats this as the essential function of table politics: multiple players directing resources at the same target to prevent a runaway victory.

The mechanics favor pile-ons more than players often realize. A player controlling many Gates is spread thin by definition. Their units are distributed across the board, closer to more opponents. This means coordinating an attack from multiple directions is easier than it looks. Two players hitting a leader from different areas divides the leader's attention, their Power expenditure, and their ability to respond.

The challenge is coordination itself. Players hesitate because attacking the leader costs them Power and units, even if it is the correct move. Someone has to go first. This is where vocal leadership at the table matters: if you can convince the other players that the math demands action, and you announce that you are going first, others are more likely to follow.

The critical failure mode is when players wait for someone else to deal with the leader while each individually pursues their own agenda. The leader continues scoring, the action phase ends, and the Doom gap widens another several points. Everyone at the table made individually understandable decisions and collectively failed.

After a successful pile-on that removes the leader from the dominant position, pay attention to who is now in second place. The threat assessment conversation starts over immediately.

## Being the Threat

When you are winning, the dynamics flip. You become the target of exactly the kind of political coordination described above. Managing this is its own skill.

**Shedding heat** means reducing the attention and hostility directed at you, ideally by redirecting it at someone else. Graham borrows the concept of gaining and shedding heat from the Woodland War Machine podcast about Root, and the mechanics transfer cleanly to Cthulhu Wars.

Specific heat-shedding techniques:

**Stepping off Gates strategically.** You can voluntarily step off a Gate you control as an unlimited action. If you are on four Gates and dropping to three would make your Gate count match another player's, do it. People notice the player with the most Gates. If you are tied with others for that number, you are less conspicuous. You can even offer to step off a Gate for a specific player as a political gesture -- "I'll voluntarily give up this Gate to you if you leave me alone next phase" -- converting a board concession into a deal.

**Reveal Elder Signs when they are bad.** If players are pointing to your Elder Sign count as evidence that you are winning, and your Elder Signs are actually low-value, show them. Reveal the ones. This does not work if you are holding five Elder Signs and revealing two ones -- the math still says you have at least three more that are at minimum value two, and six Doom is still a lot. The technique only works when your Elder Signs genuinely are poor, so keep that in mind before using it.

**Balance your Gate count with the table.** Controlling more Gates than anyone else is the most visible sign of dominance. If you can consolidate your position -- fewer Gates, better defended -- while keeping your Doom income similar, you become less of an obvious target.

**Do the right thing loudly.** When you attack the current leader (even if that leader is not the biggest long-term threat), announce it and frame it as a service to the table. "I'm going after the threat. Remember this when it's time to decide who to pile on next." You convert an offensive action into a political gesture that earns you goodwill even as you spend Power.

The hardest part of being the threat is that good play got you there, and the correct response from everyone else is to attack you. The political tools above buy time and reduce the coordination against you. They do not eliminate the targeting. If you built a lead large enough to survive a round of being everyone's target, you were playing correctly. The politics is about making the coordinated response as expensive and late as possible.

---

## Faction-Specific Politics

Not all factions have the same political profile. Some create inherently political situations by design.

**Yellow Sign (Daemon Sultan)** is the most politically dependent faction in the game. Yellow Sign needs to Desecrate in specific areas, often through other players' territory. Their Spellbook requirement to give away three Doom directly involves another player as a recipient. Their accumulation of Elder Signs makes them a target for suspicion throughout the game. Playing Yellow Sign well means maintaining active diplomatic relationships from turn one. You need transit agreements to reach Desecrate zones. You need credibility so other players believe you when you say you are passing through rather than seizing territory. And you need to manage the paranoia that comes with holding a growing pile of face-down Elder Signs.

**Cthulhu** has a different political footprint: extremely dangerous in combat, especially after unlocking unlimited combat, but also a natural enforcer. Cthulhu can credibly threaten anyone on the board and is often courted as a coalition partner. The political value is in choosing who to enforce against. If you can get another player to direct Cthulhu's combat power at the leader, that is the "Power of Friendship" play in its most explicit form. Cthulhu with unlimited combat hammering the board leader while you accumulate Gates elsewhere is one of the cleanest outcomes you can engineer through table talk.

**Black Goat** tends to generate heat quickly through rapid Gate expansion and the Ghroth ability. A Black Goat with excess Power is genuinely alarming to experienced players. The political challenge is managing early heat before you have the board position to defend it. Being targeted early is the most common way Black Goat games go wrong.

**Windwalker** is geographically isolated in Antarctica early and often plays a loner game by default. The cold geography creates natural distance from political entanglements, but also makes it harder to intervene when you need to help take down a leader elsewhere on the board.

The general pattern: factions that need to move through other players' territory need diplomacy most urgently. Factions with powerful combat tools are natural coalition magnets. Factions that accumulate hidden scoring invite paranoia. Know your faction's political profile before the first action phase begins, and plan your table talk strategy accordingly.

## Common Political Mistakes

**Attacking the wrong player.** Territorial instinct often drives players to fight whoever is nearest, whoever stole a Gate last round, or whoever they have a personal history with. None of these are necessarily the real threat. Before initiating combat, ask: does this attack help address the actual leader, or does it just satisfy a local grievance while the actual problem gets worse?

**Missing the real threat.** A player quietly accumulating Elder Signs while looking mid-table on Doom, or a player who skipped the Ritual and is sitting on a huge Power surplus, may be far ahead of what the Doom track shows. Run the full calculation -- visible Doom plus Ritual income plus Elder Sign estimates -- before deciding who the leader is. Raw Doom alone will mislead you.

**Punishing the player who knocked the leader down.** If the second-place player attacks the leader and knocks them back, that player did something correct and expensive. Attacking them immediately afterward as the "new threat" is a common error that discourages exactly the behavior the table needs. If you are in third place, recognize the correct move and redirect your attention to whoever is now in second.

**Making vague agreements.** An unspecified non-aggression promise is an invitation to be surprised. Every agreement should name the scope, duration, and specific prohibited actions. Disagreements about what was agreed to are almost always the result of insufficient specificity in the original deal.

**Burning bridges unnecessarily.** Cthulhu Wars players tend to play with the same groups repeatedly. Betraying an ally to win one game costs you political credibility in every future game. Graham is explicit that keeping his word, even when he could gain a short-term advantage by breaking it, has paid off over time because other players take him seriously. Long-term reputation is a compounding asset.

**Not talking enough.** The most common mistake is simply not engaging. Sitting quietly and playing your faction in isolation while the leader builds an insurmountable position is a passive form of losing. The table talk is always available. Use it constantly -- at the start, in the middle, and especially at the end when the math is becoming clear.

**Ignoring the meta-game of player tendencies.** Who at the table holds grudges? Who keeps their word? Who will ignore correct advice because they have a territorial rivalry going? Knowing your players shapes which political tactics will actually work. Trying to reason with someone who is playing out a personal vendetta from last week's game is a waste of time. Leveraging that vendetta -- pointing the grudge-holder at the leader -- is the right move. If someone betrayed you in the previous game, you are not obligated to help them. Tell them explicitly: "I'm not doing you any favors until you earn back my trust." That is a legitimate and effective political stance.

---

## Debriefing After Games

Graham closes the episode with a practice he credits partly to his mentor Cheshire on Discord: always debrief after the game. Even if you are frustrated or salty about the outcome, sit with the other players afterward and reconstruct what happened. Where did the threat assessment go wrong? Who should have been targeted earlier? Which political agreement failed, and why?

This practice is the fastest way to improve at both threat assessment and table politics. "Did we assess the threat incorrectly?" is one of the most useful questions you can ask after any Cthulhu Wars game. The emotional reaction to losing is normal and valid. The analytical conversation afterward is what turns that loss into a better game next time.

Both threat assessment and table politics are arts, not sciences. They resist being fully systematized. But they can be practiced, sharpened, and refined with every game. At the highest level of play -- where mechanical skill is roughly equal across the table -- they matter more than almost anything else. Words and table talk, done correctly, are the most powerful tools in Cthulhu Wars.
