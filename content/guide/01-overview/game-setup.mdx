## Common Setup Mistakes

Even experienced players occasionally make these errors:

- **Wrong Cultist count.** Each faction starts with exactly 6 Cultists total — 1 on the starting Gate, and 5 more freely placed in (or near) the starting region. Don't put all 6 on the Gate.
- **Forgetting the first-round exception.** There is no Power Phase on Round 1. Every player simply starts with 8 Power and goes straight to the Action Phase.
- **Opener of the Way sets up last.** If Opener is in the game, they choose their starting territory *after* everyone else has placed, not simultaneously.
- **Windwalker forgets to choose a pole.** Ithaqua starts at either the North or South Pole — the player chooses each game.
- **Ritual cost marker starts at 5, not 0.** It's easy to forget to place this token, or to place it at the wrong value.
- **Doom track markers at 0.** All players start at 0 Doom. Any player who accidentally starts above 0 has a significant advantage.
- **Not separating expansion units.** If you have multiple expansions, sort units by expansion before setup to avoid mixing components.
- **Great Old Ones left on the board.** All GOOs start in their owner's pool (off the board). They must be awakened through play.

## Starting Power Quick Reference

| Setup | Power Source | Amount |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 Starting Gate | 2 Power | 2 |
| 6 Starting Cultists | 1 Power each | 6 |
| **Round 1 Total** | | **8** |

Every faction starts equal at 8 Power. Round 2+ power will vary based on Gates controlled and Cultists on the board.
