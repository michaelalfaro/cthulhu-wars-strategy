## Common Setup Mistakes

Even experienced players occasionally make these errors:

- **Wrong Cultist count.** Each faction starts with exactly 6 Cultists total — 1 on the starting Gate, and 5 more freely placed in (or near) the starting region. Don't put all 6 on the Gate.
- **Forgetting the first-round exception.** There is no Power Phase on Round 1. Every player simply starts with 8 Power and goes straight to the Action Phase.
- **Opener of the Way sets up last.** If Opener is in the game, they choose their starting territory *after* everyone else has placed, not simultaneously.
- **Windwalker forgets to choose a pole.** Ithaqua starts at either the North or South Pole — the player chooses each game.
- **Ritual cost marker starts at 5, not 0.** It's easy to forget to place this token, or to place it at the wrong value.
- **Doom track markers at 0.** All players start at 0 Doom. Any player who accidentally starts above 0 has a significant advantage.
- **Not separating expansion units.** If you have multiple expansions, sort units by expansion before setup to avoid mixing components.
- **Great Old Ones left on the board.** All GOOs start in their owner's pool (off the board). They must be awakened through play.

## Starting Power Quick Reference

| Setup | Power Source | Amount |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 Starting Gate | 2 Power | 2 |
| 6 Starting Cultists | 1 Power each | 6 |
| **Round 1 Total** | | **8** |

Every faction starts equal at 8 Power. Round 2+ power will vary based on Gates controlled and Cultists on the board.

## Choosing Neutral Units

When setting up a game with neutral expansions, your choice of which to include significantly affects faction balance and game dynamics. Not all neutral packs are equal in complexity, and some combinations work better than others depending on player count and experience level.

### For New Players

Start with just the base game (no neutrals) for your first 2-3 games. The four core factions already create rich strategic interactions, and adding neutrals before everyone understands their faction's spellbooks and economy will slow the game down and muddy the learning process.

Once your group is comfortable, add **one** neutral expansion. Recommended first additions:

- **High Priest** -- adds a single unit per faction with minimal rules overhead. If anyone has played Tcho-Tcho, they already know how High Priests work. The Unspeakable Oath (sacrifice for 2 Power at instant speed) teaches the loyalty card mechanic and creates interesting end-of-round decisions without overwhelming anyone.
- **Azathoth** -- introduces neutral spellbooks (which any faction can claim instead of a faction spellbook), a handful of neutral monsters, and the Azathoth GOO as a shared catastrophic threat. The neutral spellbooks create memorable "do I take my faction spellbook or gamble on a powerful neutral one?" moments, and Azathoth's arrival is dramatic enough to be a teaching moment about the Doom Phase.

Avoid starting with Cosmic Terrors or the Ramsey Campbell packs -- these add units with complex triggered abilities (permanent unit removal, death triggers, capture mechanics) that are better appreciated once your group has internalized the base combat system.

### Recommended Combinations by Player Count

**3 players:** Keep the neutral count low. With only three factions on the board, each neutral unit has an outsized impact on area control and combat balance. **High Priest** alone is the safest addition -- it gives everyone a 7th Power source and adds gate security decisions without cluttering the map. If you want monsters on the board, add one small pack like **Beyond Time and Space** (Wamps and Ghouls) for a couple of affordable neutral monsters that do not dominate the map.

**4 players (standard):** This is the sweet spot for neutral variety. Run **High Priest** plus 1-2 monster or terror packs. Strong combinations:
- High Priest + **Dunwich Horror** -- the Dunwich Horror itself is a dramatic neutral GOO that creates a shared threat, and the accompanying monsters add depth to the Doom Phase economy.
- High Priest + **Masks of Nyarlathotep** -- Dark Demons (neutral cultists), the Shadow Pharaoh terror, and two independent GOOs (the Bloated Woman and the Haunter of the Dark). Particularly interesting when Crawling Chaos is in the game, since several units have asymmetric rules for that faction.
- High Priest + **Cosmic Terrors** -- the Great Race of Yith, Dhole, and Quachil Uttaus are all powerful enough to reshape the game, but at 4 players there is enough board presence to contest them.

**5+ players:** More neutrals help prevent runaway leaders and give trailing players options for catching up through the Doom Phase. With a full or near-full table, the board is crowded and combat is frequent -- neutral monsters and terrors give factions additional tools to compete without relying solely on their faction units. Consider running **3-4 neutral packs** at 5+ players. The Doom Phase competition for loyalty cards becomes a meaningful sub-game when multiple desirable neutrals are available.

### Faction Considerations

Some neutrals particularly benefit or challenge certain factions:

- **Great Cthulhu** benefits heavily from **Cosmic Terrors**, especially Quachil Uttaus -- Submerge into a full stack alongside Quachil Uttaus and the opponent faces kills that trigger permanent unit removal or Elder Sign generation. The Dhole's 5 combat dice also pair well with Cthulhu's aggressive Submerge-and-fight playstyle.
- **Crawling Chaos** has a special relationship with **Masks of Nyarlathotep** -- several units in the pack have asymmetric rules when controlled by Crawling Chaos, reflecting Nyarlathotep's many forms. This pack is most interesting when CC is in the game.
- **Black Goat** should be cautious with **High Priest** -- Groth affects all Cultists (including High Priests), so a poorly timed Groth can sacrifice your own High Priest. Plan your Groth timing around your High Priest's position.
- **Tcho-Tcho** is slightly weakened when **High Priest** is added, since exclusive access to High Priests is one of their distinctive advantages. When every faction gets one, that edge is diluted.
- **The Sleeper** is weakened by **High Priest** -- Lethargy's core value is taking the last action while opponents are at 0 Power. When everyone has a High Priest they can sacrifice for 2 Power at instant speed, being at 0 Power no longer means being helpless.
- **Trailing factions** in general benefit from the **Great Race of Yith** -- its Possession ability captures enemy Cultists during Gather Power regardless of GOO presence, which is a powerful catch-up mechanism that strips Gates from leaders while generating Power for the captor.

### Combinations to Be Careful With

- **Cosmic Terrors + Ramsey Campbell 1 + Ramsey Campbell 2 in a 3-player game** -- too many high-impact neutrals competing for too few Doom Phase purchases. Games can stall as players agonize over which loyalty card to buy, and the sheer number of powerful neutral units can overshadow faction identity.
- **All neutral packs at once with new players** -- the neutral spellbooks, multiple monster types, terror immunity rules, and independent GOO awakening conditions create significant cognitive load. Add packs incrementally across sessions rather than dumping everything in at once.
- **Azathoth + many other neutral packs** -- Azathoth's neutral spellbooks already create the tension of "do I take a faction spellbook or a neutral one?" Adding too many other neutral options on top can make the Doom Phase decision space overwhelming, particularly for players still learning their faction's spellbook tree.
- **Multiple terror packs without experienced players** -- Terrors are immune to spellbook abilities that target monsters (no Devour, no Flying Polyps, no Invisibility), and each has a unique triggered ability. Running the Cosmic Terrors alongside the Shadow Pharaoh from Masks of Nyarlathotep and the additional terror from Something About Cats means four or more Terrors with different rules on the table. Make sure every player understands the Terror immunity distinction before adding more than one terror pack.
