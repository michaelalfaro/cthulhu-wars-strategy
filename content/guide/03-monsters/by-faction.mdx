# Neutral Monsters

## Overview

Neutral monsters are purchased during the **Doom Phase** (not the Action Phase) using Power.
Any player can buy them at any time during the Doom Phase — there is no requirement to have your
own Great Old One in play. To acquire a neutral monster set, you first spend **2 Doom** to obtain
the loyalty card (which places one monster on the map immediately), then spend Power during
subsequent Doom Phases to summon additional monsters of that type from the pool. You may only
purchase one neutral monster per Doom Phase. Unlike Cosmic Terrors (which cost 2 Doom + 2 Power),
neutral monsters cost only Power after the initial loyalty card acquisition.

This page covers neutral monsters from multiple official expansions: the six Dreamlands monsters,
four Opener of the Way pack neutrals, Ramsey Campbell Horrors creatures, Beyond Time and Space
monsters, CATaclysm and Something About Cats units, and the Yuggoth map-specific Slime Mold.

## Dreamlands Surface Monsters

*Covered in Episode 17: "A Surface Level Discussion"*

### Gnorri
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 3 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 3
**Combat:** 2
**Grottos:** Ongoing. During the Doom Phase, if you have 2 Gnorri in play, you earn 1 extra Doom
point. If you have 3 Gnorri in play, you earn 2 extra Doom points.

The Gnorri's value is entirely tied to keeping them alive long enough to generate returns. With 2
Gnorri in play you recoup 1 Doom per phase, meaning they pay off the initial 2-Doom loyalty cost
after two Doom Phases. With all 3 Gnorri in play you earn 2 extra Doom per phase — netting 2 Doom
ahead of your initial investment as early as the second Doom Phase you hold all three. The host's
core advice is simple: **summon your Gnorri and keep them safe**. Park them in a defended area with
your main force, do not send them adventuring, and let them generate passive income. Almost every
faction can make use of this — ritual-heavy engine factions benefit most from the steady Doom
income, while combat-capable factions have an easier time defending them inside a death ball.
Unlike many neutral monsters that offer situational value, the Gnorri have a straightforward payoff
timeline that makes them consistently worth purchasing when available.

### Moonbeasts
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 4
**Combat:** 0
**Blasphemous Obeisance:** Ongoing. When a Moonbeast is summoned, place it on an enemy faction's
Spellbook. While the Moonbeast is there, that player cannot use that Spellbook (it still counts
for purposes such as Unlimited Battle and winning the game). The Moonbeast is returned to one of
your controlled Gates at the start of the owning player's Doom Phase turn. The victim may
prematurely remove the Moonbeast at any time (not as an action) by paying 1 Doom. Multiple
Moonbeasts may be placed on the same Spellbook.

Moonbeasts have 0 combat — their entire value is their ability to lock down enemy Spellbooks.
When first obtained, the loyalty card places a Moonbeast on an enemy Spellbook immediately; the
remaining three in the pool each cost 2 Power to summon and can be directed at the same Spellbook
or spread across different factions. The key tension for the victim is that paying 1 Doom to
remove a Moonbeast is costly but removing it is the only way to recover the ability before the
Doom Phase. Most players will wait until the Doom Phase to get the Moonbeast returned for free,
which means your Moonbeast is shutting down a Spellbook for the entire Action Phase — an
enormous advantage if the locked book is a signature ability. Stacking multiple Moonbeasts on
the same Spellbook is particularly punishing: the victim must pay 1 Doom per Moonbeast to clear
them all, or wait through multiple Doom Phases. High-priority targets include Crawling Chaos
(Madness, Thousand Forms, Emissary of the Outer Gods), Great Cthulhu (Submerge), Yellow Sign
(Screaming Dead, Third Eye), and the Tcho-Tcho Hierophants book. Because Moonbeasts return to
your controlled Gates when removed, they also serve a secondary purpose as Gate defenders —
opponents thinking about attacking your Gates may hesitate knowing that killing a Moonbeast returns it to your pool for future re-deployment.

### Shantaks
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 2
**Combat:** 2
**Horror Steed:** Ongoing. When moving a Shantak, it can reach any area on the map. In addition,
the Shantak may carry one of your Cultists with it for free.

Shantaks are among the strongest neutral monsters available and rank as a top-one or top-two pick
whenever they appear in the neutral pool. Their Horror Steed ability provides true unlimited
movement — not adjacency-based like most movement, but genuinely any area on the map — for the
standard cost of 1 Power to move. Carrying a Cultist for free on that same move compounds the
value significantly, since you are effectively moving two units for the price of one. The
strategic application that makes Shantaks exceptional is gate stealing: over the course of any
game there will be areas where both sides have fought each other out completely, leaving a Gate
sitting uncontrolled and remote. A Shantak with a Cultist rider can swoop in from anywhere on the
map for a single Power, arriving with 2 combat and an Acolyte ready to take control. This is
especially effective late in the Action Phase when opponents are low on Power and cannot respond.
The host rates Shantaks as one of the best gate-stealing tools in the game. Every faction can
benefit from this kind of opportunistic reach, though more mobile factions that can stall out
Power spending and act late in the Action Phase will extract the most value. Buy these whenever
they are available.

## Dreamlands Underworld Monsters

*Covered in Episode 18: "The Land Down Under"*

### Ghasts
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card — places all 4 Ghasts on the map immediately) + 2 Power to re-trigger Hordling (Doom Phase)
**Count:** 4
**Combat:** 0
**Hordling:** Ongoing. When you spend 2 Power during the Doom Phase, all Ghasts currently in your
pool are immediately placed on the map at any Gates you control. You may distribute them across
multiple Gates if you wish. Note: the loyalty card itself places all 4 Ghasts immediately upon
purchase; Hordling is used on subsequent Doom Phases to redeploy Ghasts that have died and
returned to the pool.

Ghasts have 0 combat, which is unusual, but the Hordling ability explains the design: for a flat
2 Power cost you can dump every Ghast in your pool onto the map at once. This makes them
exceptionally cheap mass-body generators. Zero combat still prevents enemy monsters from
capturing your Cultists (a monster must be present to block capture), so a Gate stacked with
Ghasts is meaningfully defended against enemy monster forces even if it will fold to any committed
Great Old One. For most factions, Ghasts function as cheap meat shields — surround your Great Old
One with Ghasts to absorb Kills and force opponents to chew through a pile of bodies. The faction
that benefits most dramatically from Ghasts is **Great Cthulhu**. Great Cthulhu's Absorb ability
lets a Shoggoth eat any number of allied units before battle, rolling 3 extra dice for each unit
absorbed. Absorbing a full squad of Ghasts before a fight adds up to 12 extra dice (4 Ghasts x 3
dice each) for only 2 Power to reload the entire Ghast pool afterward. This cycle — absorb all
Ghasts for a massive dice surge, then resummon all of them for 2 Power at your controlled Gates
— is extraordinarily efficient. If you are Great Cthulhu and Ghasts are available, the host
considers purchasing them your top priority. Conversely, if you are playing against Great Cthulhu
and Ghasts are in the pool, it is worth buying them just to deny that faction the combo.

### Gugs
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 1 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 2
**Combat:** 3
**Clumsy:** Ongoing. A Gug cannot capture a Cultist.

Gugs offer the most raw combat per Power cost of any unit in this neutral set — 3 combat for
1 Power is a steep discount compared to most monsters. Their downside is that they cannot capture
Cultists, which limits their offensive utility in a game where threatening to capture enemy units
is often a key form of area denial. The host's assessment is blunt: they are big cheap combat
contributors and nothing more. Defensive factions that struggle to roll large numbers of combat
dice can use Gugs to add 3 or 6 dice to a critical area at minimal cost. Offensive death-ball
factions moving a large stack around the map also appreciate the extra dice on the cheap. They are
not a top-priority neutral purchase — unlike Ghasts (which have a specific synergy) or Leng
Spiders (which convert dice results into extra Kills), Gugs simply roll dice and that is it. They
are a reasonable pickup if other neutrals are unavailable or if you have Power to spare and want
reinforcements in a contested area.

### Leng Spiders
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 3
**Combat:** 1
**Bloodthirst:** Ongoing. If a Leng Spider is involved in a battle, you may exchange 2 Pain
results for 1 Kill before results are assigned. You may do this once for each Leng Spider in the
battle. Each use may be applied to your results or your opponent's results.

Leng Spiders are the best of the three underworld monsters and rank among the most desirable
neutrals overall. Bloodthirst converts Pain results — which are normally resolved as unit movement
rather than elimination — into outright Kills, effectively changing the probability distribution
of a combat roll in your favor. On any roll of roughly 6 dice, you expect approximately 2 Pain
results (Pain shows up roughly one-in-three dice), which a single Leng Spider converts into 1
free Kill before results are even applied. With 2 or 3 Leng Spiders in the same battle and 10 or
more dice on the table, you can realistically convert 2 or 3 extra Kills per fight — a
devastating swing. Critically, Bloodthirst can also be applied to your opponent's Pain results,
turning their luck against them by converting their pains into kills on their own units. The
factions that benefit most are combat-heavy factions rolling large dice pools: Great Cthulhu
(Submerge + mass combat), Windwalker (mobile death ball), and any faction that can concentrate
forces and move cheaply. The host calls Leng Spiders the cream of the crop for this expansion and
considers them worth the 2 Doom entry cost whenever combat is a meaningful part of your strategy.

## Opener of the Way Expansion Neutrals

These monsters ship with the Azathoth (Opener of the Way) faction box but are neutral monsters
any player can purchase.

### Dimensional Shambler
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 3
**Combat:** 2
**Walk Between Worlds:** Ongoing. When summoned, place on your Faction Card. After any Action
(by any player), place one or more from your Faction Card in any Area.

Dimensional Shamblers are instant-deployment ambush units that bypass normal summoning
restrictions. Instead of appearing at a Gate when summoned, they sit on your Faction Card and
can be placed in any area on the map after any player's action — yours or an opponent's. This
means you can react to enemy movement, reinforce a battle already in progress, block a capture
attempt, or project force into an area where the opponent thought they were safe. The tactical
flexibility is enormous: an opponent who moves their Great Old One into a seemingly undefended
area may suddenly face two or three Dimensional Shamblers that materialized out of nowhere. At
2 combat each, a full squad of three adds 6 dice to any fight they crash. Aggressive factions
that want to project force reactively — responding to threats rather than committing units in
advance — get the most out of Dimensional Shamblers. They pair particularly well with factions
that already have strong combat presence and want supplemental units that can appear anywhere
without spending movement actions.

### Elder Thing
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 3
**Combat:** 2
**Mind Control:** If an Elder Thing shares an Area with an enemy Great Old One, that GOO may
not use its Special Ability.

Elder Things are targeted GOO shutdown units. Placing an Elder Thing in the same area as an
enemy Great Old One disables that GOO's Special Ability entirely — not its combat dice, but
its text ability. This is devastating against GOOs whose power comes from their ability rather
than their raw combat stats. Use Elder Things against Cthulhu (shuts down Devour), Hastur
(shuts down ability), or any GOO whose text says "Action" or "Ongoing" as the ability type.
At 2 combat and 2 Power, an Elder Thing is a competent combat unit even without the shutdown
effect, but the real value is forcing opponents to either clear the Elder Thing before using
their GOO or accept that their most powerful unit is reduced to a dice-rolling body with no
special text. Three Elder Things can suppress up to three different enemy GOOs simultaneously
in a multiplayer game, making this one of the most efficient counters available in the neutral
monster pool.

### Star Vampire
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 3
**Combat:** 1
**Vampirism:** Battle. Roll Star Vampire's combat dice separately. Each Pain drains 1 Power
from enemy. Each Kill drains 1 Doom from enemy.

Star Vampires are economic warfare units. Even at only 1 combat die, the Star Vampire's hits
are devastating — a Kill drains 1 Doom from the enemy (not just a unit loss, but actual Doom
reduction), and a Pain drains 1 Power from the enemy. In a large battle with multiple Star
Vampires, the resource drain compounds rapidly. Three Star Vampires rolling separately means
three chances to strip Power or Doom from the opponent on top of whatever damage your other
units inflict. The Doom drain on Kills is particularly punishing in the late game when every
point of Doom matters for ritual timing. Star Vampires are best in combat-heavy factions that
fight frequently — factions that avoid combat will rarely trigger Vampirism, but factions that
seek out battles (Windwalker, Great Cthulhu, Sleeper) can drain significant resources over
the course of a game. Roll the Star Vampire dice separately as the card requires, and track
the resource drain carefully.

### Servitor of the Outer Gods
**Cost:** 2 Doom (to give the loyalty card to an opponent) + 1 Power per Servitor (summoned during Doom Phase by the recipient)
**Count:** 3
**Combat:** -1
**Adulation:** Ongoing. The owner of this Loyalty Card may not Summon any Monsters except
Servitors if any Servitors are still in their pool.

Servitors of the Outer Gods are unique among neutral monsters because the loyalty card is
given to another player, not kept by you. You pay 2 Doom to hand the loyalty card (and its
3 Servitors) to an opponent. That opponent now owns 3 Servitors with -1 combat — meaning
each Servitor actually subtracts from their combat total — and the Adulation ability prevents
them from summoning any other monsters until all Servitors are out of their pool. This is
pure sabotage. The target player must waste actions and Power summoning useless negative-combat
units just to clear the blockage before they can resume summoning their actual faction monsters.
This is one of the most disruptive neutral monsters in the game. Best used against
monster-heavy factions that rely on a steady stream of summoning to function — Black Goat
(which needs Dark Young and Fungi on the table), Crawling Chaos (which needs Nightgaunts and
Flying Polyps), or any faction whose game plan depends on getting specific monsters into play
quickly. The 2 Doom cost is steep, but crippling an opponent's monster pipeline for multiple
turns can be worth far more than 2 Doom in competitive value.

## Ramsey Campbell Horrors 1 Neutrals

From the Ramsey Campbell Horrors 1 expansion.

### Insects from Shaggai
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 3
**Combat:** 0
**Mind Parasite:** Ongoing. Grants player control over enemy Acolyte Cultists sharing an area
with Insects for movement and combat purposes.

Insects from Shaggai are Cultist-hijacking units. Any enemy Acolyte Cultists in the same area
as your Insects come under your control for movement and combat — you can march them away from
their Gates, use them as meat shields in your battles, or simply deny the opponent their own
pieces. At 0 combat the Insects themselves are fragile and contribute nothing to dice rolls,
but they do not need to fight — they steal the enemy's units instead. The Mind Parasite effect
is ongoing, meaning it applies constantly as long as the Insects share an area with enemy
Cultists, not just during battle. Moving an Insect into a heavily Cultist-populated area can
swing control of that area dramatically. Particularly effective against Cultist-heavy factions
like Black Goat or Yellow Sign where many Acolytes cluster together around Gates. The
opponent must either move their Cultists away from the Insects (abandoning Gates) or commit
combat units to eliminate the 0-combat Insects — either way, the disruption costs them actions
and positioning.

## Ramsey Campbell Horrors 2 Neutrals

From the Ramsey Campbell Horrors 2 expansion.

### Satyr
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 3
**Combat:** 1
**Fecund:** Ongoing. Each time you Summon a Satyr, also place an Acolyte Cultist from your
Pool in the same Area.

Satyrs provide free Cultist generation. Every time you summon a Satyr during the Doom Phase,
you also get a free Acolyte Cultist placed in the same area — effectively turning a single
summoning action into two deployments. For factions that burn through Cultists quickly (Great
Cthulhu losing them to combat attrition, any faction using Cultists as battle fodder, or
factions that need to spread Cultists to multiple Gates), Satyrs provide a repeatable Cultist
refill mechanism. Three Satyrs summoned across three Doom Phases means three bonus Cultists at
no additional cost. The Satyr itself contributes 1 combat die, which is modest, but the real
value is the Cultist economy — each Satyr summon saves you the 1 Power you would otherwise
spend to recruit a Cultist separately, plus saves you the action. In the mid-to-late game when
Cultist attrition is high and Gate control is contested, having a built-in Cultist generator
attached to your monster summons is a significant advantage.

## Beyond Time and Space Neutrals

From the Beyond Time and Space expansion.

### Voonith
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 3 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 2
**Combat:** 1
**Vicious:** Post-Battle. For each Kill scored fewer than the number of Vooniths involved in
the Battle, add 1 Kill.

Vooniths guarantee kills regardless of dice results. Two Vooniths in a single battle guarantee
at least 2 kills no matter what the dice show — if you roll 0 kills, you add 2; if you roll
1 kill, you add 1. This makes Vooniths among the most reliable combat units in the game. At 3
Power per summon they are expensive for neutral monsters, but the kill guarantee means they
never waste a battle. Unlike every other combat unit where a bad roll can mean zero impact,
Vooniths ensure a minimum kill floor that only goes up with lucky dice. Pair with any faction
that values consistent lethality over raw dice volume. For factions with unreliable dice or low
combat stats, Vooniths provide certainty in a game built on randomness. The recommendation:
bring both Vooniths into the same fight whenever possible to maximize the guaranteed-kill floor.
Two Vooniths in one battle with other units means at least 2 kills plus whatever your other
units contribute — a devastating minimum that most opponents cannot afford to absorb repeatedly.

### Wamp
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 1 Power per monster
**Count:** 4
**Combat:** 0
**Loyalty card mechanic:** When you purchase the loyalty card (2 Doom), choose an enemy — that
enemy must place all 4 Wamps in any Area or Areas without a Gate.

Wamps are offensive placement sabotage units. Unlike every other neutral monster, Wamps are
placed in your opponent's territory, not yours. When you buy the loyalty card, you choose an
enemy and that enemy must place all 4 Wamps in areas without a Gate. The 4 Wamps flood enemy
areas with 0-combat bodies that cannot fight but do occupy space and interfere with movement
and positioning. The opponent must spend actions dealing with them — fighting them, moving
around them, or simply tolerating the clutter. This is a harassment tool, not a combat unit.
The Wamps themselves do nothing useful for their owner — they are dead weight that costs
actions to clear. Most effective against opponents who are tight on actions and cannot afford
to waste turns clearing out 0-combat speedbumps. The psychological impact is also significant:
an opponent suddenly saddled with 4 unwanted units scattered across their territory has to
rethink their entire turn plan to deal with the obstruction.

## CATaclysm Neutrals

From the CATaclysm expansion.

### Giant Blind Albino Penguin
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 1 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 2
**Combat:** -2
**Laughingstock:** Pre-Battle. Move one or more Penguins to any Battle area, even if you are
not part of the battle. If you are part of the battle, the Penguin fights on your side.
Otherwise, you choose which side the Penguin fights on.

Giant Blind Albino Penguins are comedy sabotage with a real mechanical bite. At -2 combat, the
Penguin subtracts dice from whichever side it joins. The critical point is that you can inject
Penguins into battles you are not even in — if two opponents are fighting each other, drop a
Penguin onto the side you want to lose and subtract 2 (or 4 with both Penguins) from their
total. This can swing close battles decisively. The cost is negligible (1 Power to summon),
making Penguins a cheap, repeatable disruption tool. Despite the silly name, the mechanical
impact of subtracting 4 dice from an opponent's battle roll is real. In a game where many
battles are decided by margins of 1 or 2 kills, removing 4 dice from one side is often the
difference between winning and losing. Penguins are at their best in multiplayer games where
two opponents are fighting and you want to influence the outcome without committing your own
forces — a form of kingmaking that costs you almost nothing.

## Something About Cats Neutrals

From the Something About Cats expansion. All three cats are cheap (Cost 1, Combat 1) with
unique disruptive abilities.

### Asteroid Cat
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 1 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 2
**Combat:** 1
**Abandoned to Lusts:** Action: Cost 0. If an Asteroid Cat shares an Area with a Unit from
another Faction that has 5 or fewer Faction Spellbooks, remove the Cat from the Map and place
it on one of that enemy's empty Spellbook slots.

Asteroid Cats provide spellbook denial. Placing the Asteroid Cat on an enemy's empty spellbook
slot blocks that slot and lets you influence which spellbook they must take when they earn one.
This is strongest in the early-to-mid game when opponents still have empty slots to block.
Against factions with one critical spellbook they want to take first (Crawling Chaos's Madness,
Great Cthulhu's Submerge), the Asteroid Cat can force them into a suboptimal spellbook order —
a disruption that echoes through the rest of the game. The action costs 0 Power, making it
essentially free to activate. The limitation is that the target faction must have 5 or fewer
Faction Spellbooks, so this becomes less useful in the late game when opponents have filled
most of their slots. Use Asteroid Cats early and target the faction whose spellbook order
matters most.

### Cat from Mercury
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 1 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 2
**Combat:** 1
**Needs Affection:** Pre-Battle. If a Cat from Mercury is in a Battle, you can choose one or
more of your Monsters present at that Battle, and immediately replace them with your Acolyte
Cultists from your Pool.

Cats from Mercury enable monster-to-Cultist conversion mid-battle. Before a fight resolves,
swap out a monster for a Cultist from your pool. This is situationally useful when you need
Cultists on the map more than you need that particular monster — for example, if you have been
losing Cultists and need Gate controllers, the Cat from Mercury lets you trade a combat piece
for a Gate-holding piece at exactly the moment combat is happening. The conversion happens
pre-battle, so the Cultist is present for the fight (and at risk of being killed), but the
strategic value is in having a Cultist on the map in a contested area where you might need one
for Gate control after the battle resolves. This is a niche ability that shines in specific
situations rather than providing consistent value every game.

### Cat from Venus
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 1 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 2
**Combat:** 1
**Honeymoon:** Ongoing. When a Cat from Venus Captures a Cultist, gain 1 Power and immediately
return the Cultist to the owner's Pool.

Cats from Venus generate Power through non-destructive capture. Unlike normal captures that
deny the opponent their Cultist permanently (until they re-recruit), the Cat from Venus
returns the Cultist to the owner's pool after capturing — but you still gain 1 Power for the
capture, plus the standard capture bonus. This creates a Power-generation engine that does not
permanently harm the opponent's economy, making it less politically provocative than a standard
capture. The opponent gets their Cultist back in their pool (ready to re-recruit), and you get
Power for the capture. Useful for factions that want steady Power income without escalating
conflict — capturing with a Cat from Venus is less likely to provoke retaliation because the
victim recovers their Cultist immediately. Over multiple turns, the Power generation adds up
while maintaining relatively peaceful diplomatic relations.

## Yuggoth Map Neutrals

From the Yuggoth Map expansion. These monsters are only available when playing on the Yuggoth
map.

### Slime Mold
**Cost:** 1 Power per monster (after first free placement)
**Count:** 6
**Combat:** 2
**Map-specific mechanic:** Tied to the Slime Sea Overlook Gate on the Yuggoth Map. The first
Slime Mold is placed for free when you take control of the Slime Sea Overlook; subsequent
Slime Molds cost 1 Power each.

Slime Molds are a map-dependent swarm unit available only on the Yuggoth map. They provide an
exceptionally cheap source of 2-combat bodies — 1 Power for 2 combat dice is the best rate in
the game for a neutral monster. With 6 available, a player controlling the Slime Sea Overlook
can flood the map with cheap combat power. The first Slime Mold arrives for free when you take
the Slime Sea Overlook Gate, and each subsequent one costs just 1 Power — no 2 Doom loyalty
card required like other neutrals. The limitation is that Slime Molds are entirely unavailable
on any other map. When playing Yuggoth, controlling the Slime Sea Overlook and summoning Slime
Molds aggressively is a strong early-game strategy for any faction. Six units at 2 combat each
means 12 total combat dice available for just 5 Power (after the first free one), a rate that
no other neutral monster set can match. The Yuggoth map's unique geography makes the Slime Sea
Overlook a critical strategic objective specifically because of this monster pool.

## Tips & Faction Synergies

**Buy Shantaks almost unconditionally.** The host explicitly rates Shantaks as a top-one or
top-two neutral pick whenever they appear in the pool, regardless of your faction. Unlimited
movement plus a free Cultist carry for 1 Power is a capability no faction turns down. Even in
games where you do not urgently need gate-stealing range, having two combat units that can appear
anywhere at the end of the Action Phase is a persistent threat that shapes how opponents have to
position.

**Gnorri require patience, not aggression.** The Doom generation from Grottos only pays off if your
Gnorri survive. Park all three in a heavily defended area (alongside your GOO or a large allied
stack) and treat them as a passive Doom engine rather than combat units. Three Gnorri generating 2
bonus Doom per phase for three or four phases is a 6-8 Doom swing that dramatically accelerates
your ritualing ability.

**Moonbeasts punish factions whose power comes from one or two key Spellbooks.** Identify your
opponent's most critical Spellbook early — the one they took first and rely on constantly — and
put a Moonbeast there. Great Cthulhu without Submerge, Crawling Chaos without Madness, or Yellow
Sign without Screaming Dead are fundamentally weaker factions. Stacking two Moonbeasts on the
same book forces the victim to pay 2 Doom or wait two full Doom Phases to clear both.

**Ghasts are a Doom Phase reload, not an Action Phase resource.** Because Hordling fires when you
pay 2 Power during the Doom Phase, you can cycle the entire Ghast pool back onto the map every
single Doom Phase for a flat cost of 2 Power. For Great Cthulhu, this means the Absorb combo is
not a one-time trick — it is repeatable every Action Phase as long as you have the 2 Power to
reload. When facing Great Cthulhu, buying the Ghasts preemptively to deny this synergy is a
legitimate defensive play.

**Leng Spiders scale with your dice pool — pair them with combat-heavy factions.** A Leng Spider
in a battle where you are only rolling 2 or 3 dice offers little because you may not even roll 2
Pains to convert. But when Windwalker, Great Cthulhu, or any faction capable of stacking 10+
dice in one area brings even one Leng Spider along, the expected kill conversion becomes nearly
guaranteed. Consider this neutral mostly for factions that already fight big rather than those
that prefer passive Doom generation.

**Neutral monsters cost only Power after the initial 2 Doom entry — budget accordingly.** The 2
Doom spent on a loyalty card feels steep early in the game, but several of these neutrals
(especially Gnorri and Shantaks) return that investment within one or two Doom Phases. If you are
already leading on Doom and can afford the tempo cost, purchasing neutrals early gives you more
Doom Phases to recover the entry cost. If you are behind, focus on catching up through Rituals
before spending Doom on loyalty cards.

**Elder Things shut down enemy GOOs — use them as targeted counters.** If an opponent's Great Old
One is dominating through its Special Ability rather than raw combat, an Elder Thing in the same
area disables that ability entirely. This is one of the most efficient counters in the game: 2
Power for a 2-combat body that neutralizes abilities worth far more than 2 Power.

**Servitors of the Outer Gods are a weapon, not a pet.** The loyalty card is given to an
opponent, not kept by you. Spending 2 Doom to cripple an opponent's monster summoning for
multiple turns is one of the strongest disruption plays available — especially against factions
like Black Goat that depend on a steady stream of monsters.

**Vooniths guarantee kills regardless of dice — bring both to the same fight.** Unlike every
other combat unit in the game, Vooniths ensure a minimum number of kills in any battle they
participate in. Two Vooniths in one battle mean at least 2 kills no matter what. For factions
with unreliable dice or low combat stats, Vooniths provide certainty in a game built on
randomness.
