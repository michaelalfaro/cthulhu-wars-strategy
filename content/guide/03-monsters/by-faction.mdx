# Neutral Monsters

## Overview

Neutral monsters are purchased during the **Doom Phase** (not the Action Phase) using Power.
Any player can buy them at any time during the Doom Phase — there is no requirement to have your
own Great Old One in play. To acquire a neutral monster set, you first spend **2 Doom** to obtain
the loyalty card (which places one monster on the map immediately), then spend Power during
subsequent Doom Phases to summon additional monsters of that type from the pool. You may only
purchase one neutral monster per Doom Phase. Unlike Cosmic Terrors (which cost 2 Doom + 2 Power),
neutral monsters cost only Power after the initial loyalty card acquisition.

This page covers the six neutral monsters from the Dreamlands expansion: three creatures from
the surface world and three from the underworld.

## Dreamlands Surface Monsters

*Covered in Episode 17: "A Surface Level Discussion"*

### Nori
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 3 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 3
**Combat:** 2
**Grotto's:** Ongoing. During the Doom Phase, if you have 2 Nori in play, you earn 1 extra Doom
point. If you have 3 Nori in play, you earn 2 extra Doom points.

The Nori's value is entirely tied to keeping them alive long enough to generate returns. With 2
Nori in play you recoup 1 Doom per phase, meaning they pay off the initial 2-Doom loyalty cost
after two Doom Phases. With all 3 Nori in play you earn 2 extra Doom per phase — netting 2 Doom
ahead of your initial investment as early as the second Doom Phase you hold all three. The host's
core advice is simple: **summon your Nori and keep them safe**. Park them in a defended area with
your main force, do not send them adventuring, and let them generate passive income. Almost every
faction can make use of this — ritual-heavy engine factions benefit most from the steady Doom
income, while combat-capable factions have an easier time defending them inside a death ball.
Unlike many neutral monsters that offer situational value, the Nori have a straightforward payoff
timeline that makes them consistently worth purchasing when available.

### Moonbeasts
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 4
**Combat:** 0
**Blasphemous Obeisance:** Ongoing. When a Moonbeast is summoned, place it on an enemy faction's
Spellbook. While the Moonbeast is there, that player cannot use that Spellbook (it still counts
for purposes such as Unlimited Battle and winning the game). The Moonbeast is returned to one of
your controlled Gates at the start of the owning player's Doom Phase turn. The victim may
prematurely remove the Moonbeast at any time (not as an action) by paying 1 Doom. Multiple
Moonbeasts may be placed on the same Spellbook.

Moonbeasts have 0 combat — their entire value is their ability to lock down enemy Spellbooks.
When first obtained, the loyalty card places a Moonbeast on an enemy Spellbook immediately; the
remaining three in the pool each cost 2 Power to summon and can be directed at the same Spellbook
or spread across different factions. The key tension for the victim is that paying 1 Doom to
remove a Moonbeast is costly but removing it is the only way to recover the ability before the
Doom Phase. Most players will wait until the Doom Phase to get the Moonbeast returned for free,
which means your Moonbeast is shutting down a Spellbook for the entire Action Phase — an
enormous advantage if the locked book is a signature ability. Stacking multiple Moonbeasts on
the same Spellbook is particularly punishing: the victim must pay 1 Doom per Moonbeast to clear
them all, or wait through multiple Doom Phases. High-priority targets include Crawling Chaos
(Madness, Thousand Forms, Emissary of the Outer Gods), Great Cthulhu (Submerge), Yellow Sign
(Screaming Dead, Third Eye), and the Tcho-Tcho Hierophants book. Because Moonbeasts return to
your controlled Gates when removed, they also serve a secondary purpose as Gate defenders —
opponents thinking about attacking your Gates may hesitate knowing that killing a Moonbeast returns it to your pool for future re-deployment.

### Shantaks
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 2
**Combat:** 2
**Horber Steed:** Ongoing. When moving a Shantak, it can reach any area on the map. In addition,
the Shantak may carry one of your Cultists with it for free.

Shantaks are among the strongest neutral monsters available and rank as a top-one or top-two pick
whenever they appear in the neutral pool. Their Horber Steed ability provides true unlimited
movement — not adjacency-based like most movement, but genuinely any area on the map — for the
standard cost of 1 Power to move. Carrying a Cultist for free on that same move compounds the
value significantly, since you are effectively moving two units for the price of one. The
strategic application that makes Shantaks exceptional is gate stealing: over the course of any
game there will be areas where both sides have fought each other out completely, leaving a Gate
sitting uncontrolled and remote. A Shantak with a Cultist rider can swoop in from anywhere on the
map for a single Power, arriving with 2 combat and an Acolyte ready to take control. This is
especially effective late in the Action Phase when opponents are low on Power and cannot respond.
The host rates Shantaks as one of the best gate-stealing tools in the game. Every faction can
benefit from this kind of opportunistic reach, though more mobile factions that can stall out
Power spending and act late in the Action Phase will extract the most value. Buy these whenever
they are available.

## Dreamlands Underworld Monsters

*Covered in Episode 18: "The Land Down Under"*

### Ghasts
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card — places all 4 Ghasts on the map immediately) + 2 Power to re-trigger Hordling (Doom Phase)
**Count:** 4
**Combat:** 0
**Hordling:** Ongoing. When you spend 2 Power during the Doom Phase, all Ghasts currently in your
pool are immediately placed on the map at any Gates you control. You may distribute them across
multiple Gates if you wish. Note: the loyalty card itself places all 4 Ghasts immediately upon
purchase; Hordling is used on subsequent Doom Phases to redeploy Ghasts that have died and
returned to the pool.

Ghasts have 0 combat, which is unusual, but the Hordling ability explains the design: for a flat
2 Power cost you can dump every Ghast in your pool onto the map at once. This makes them
exceptionally cheap mass-body generators. Zero combat still prevents enemy monsters from
capturing your Cultists (a monster must be present to block capture), so a Gate stacked with
Ghasts is meaningfully defended against enemy monster forces even if it will fold to any committed
Great Old One. For most factions, Ghasts function as cheap meat shields — surround your Great Old
One with Ghasts to absorb Kills and force opponents to chew through a pile of bodies. The faction
that benefits most dramatically from Ghasts is **Great Cthulhu**. Great Cthulhu's Absorb ability
lets a Shoggoth eat any number of allied units before battle, rolling 3 extra dice for each unit
absorbed. Absorbing a full squad of Ghasts before a fight adds up to 12 extra dice (4 Ghasts x 3
dice each) for only 2 Power to reload the entire Ghast pool afterward. This cycle — absorb all
Ghasts for a massive dice surge, then resummon all of them for 2 Power at your controlled Gates
— is extraordinarily efficient. If you are Great Cthulhu and Ghasts are available, the host
considers purchasing them your top priority. Conversely, if you are playing against Great Cthulhu
and Ghasts are in the pool, it is worth buying them just to deny that faction the combo.

### Gugs
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 1 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 2
**Combat:** 3
**Clumsy:** Ongoing. A Gug cannot capture a Cultist.

Gugs offer the most raw combat per Power cost of any unit in this neutral set — 3 combat for
1 Power is a steep discount compared to most monsters. Their downside is that they cannot capture
Cultists, which limits their offensive utility in a game where threatening to capture enemy units
is often a key form of area denial. The host's assessment is blunt: they are big cheap combat
contributors and nothing more. Defensive factions that struggle to roll large numbers of combat
dice can use Gugs to add 3 or 6 dice to a critical area at minimal cost. Offensive death-ball
factions moving a large stack around the map also appreciate the extra dice on the cheap. They are
not a top-priority neutral purchase — unlike Ghasts (which have a specific synergy) or Lang
Spiders (which convert dice results into extra Kills), Gugs simply roll dice and that is it. They
are a reasonable pickup if other neutrals are unavailable or if you have Power to spare and want
reinforcements in a contested area.

### Lang Spiders
**Cost:** 2 Doom (loyalty card) + 2 Power per monster (summoned during Doom Phase)
**Count:** 3
**Combat:** 1
**Bloodthirst:** Ongoing. If a Lang Spider is involved in a battle, you may exchange 2 Pain
results for 1 Kill before results are assigned. You may do this once for each Lang Spider in the
battle. Each use may be applied to your results or your opponent's results.

Lang Spiders are the best of the three underworld monsters and rank among the most desirable
neutrals overall. Bloodthirst converts Pain results — which are normally resolved as unit movement
rather than elimination — into outright Kills, effectively changing the probability distribution
of a combat roll in your favor. On any roll of roughly 6 dice, you expect approximately 2 Pain
results (Pain shows up roughly one-in-three dice), which a single Lang Spider converts into 1
free Kill before results are even applied. With 2 or 3 Lang Spiders in the same battle and 10 or
more dice on the table, you can realistically convert 2 or 3 extra Kills per fight — a
devastating swing. Critically, Bloodthirst can also be applied to your opponent's Pain results,
turning their luck against them by converting their pains into kills on their own units. The
factions that benefit most are combat-heavy factions rolling large dice pools: Great Cthulhu
(Submerge + mass combat), Windwalker (mobile death ball), and any faction that can concentrate
forces and move cheaply. The host calls Lang Spiders the cream of the crop for this expansion and
considers them worth the 2 Doom entry cost whenever combat is a meaningful part of your strategy.

## Tips & Faction Synergies

**Buy Shantaks almost unconditionally.** The host explicitly rates Shantaks as a top-one or
top-two neutral pick whenever they appear in the pool, regardless of your faction. Unlimited
movement plus a free Cultist carry for 1 Power is a capability no faction turns down. Even in
games where you do not urgently need gate-stealing range, having two combat units that can appear
anywhere at the end of the Action Phase is a persistent threat that shapes how opponents have to
position.

**Nori require patience, not aggression.** The Doom generation from Grotto's only pays off if your
Nori survive. Park all three in a heavily defended area (alongside your GOO or a large allied
stack) and treat them as a passive Doom engine rather than combat units. Three Nori generating 2
bonus Doom per phase for three or four phases is a 6-8 Doom swing that dramatically accelerates
your ritualing ability.

**Moonbeasts punish factions whose power comes from one or two key Spellbooks.** Identify your
opponent's most critical Spellbook early — the one they took first and rely on constantly — and
put a Moonbeast there. Great Cthulhu without Submerge, Crawling Chaos without Madness, or Yellow
Sign without Screaming Dead are fundamentally weaker factions. Stacking two Moonbeasts on the
same book forces the victim to pay 2 Doom or wait two full Doom Phases to clear both.

**Ghasts are a Doom Phase reload, not an Action Phase resource.** Because Hordling fires when you
pay 2 Power during the Doom Phase, you can cycle the entire Ghast pool back onto the map every
single Doom Phase for a flat cost of 2 Power. For Great Cthulhu, this means the Absorb combo is
not a one-time trick — it is repeatable every Action Phase as long as you have the 2 Power to
reload. When facing Great Cthulhu, buying the Ghasts preemptively to deny this synergy is a
legitimate defensive play.

**Lang Spiders scale with your dice pool — pair them with combat-heavy factions.** A Lang Spider
in a battle where you are only rolling 2 or 3 dice offers little because you may not even roll 2
Pains to convert. But when Windwalker, Great Cthulhu, or any faction capable of stacking 10+
dice in one area brings even one Lang Spider along, the expected kill conversion becomes nearly
guaranteed. Consider this neutral mostly for factions that already fight big rather than those
that prefer passive Doom generation.

**Neutral monsters cost only Power after the initial 2 Doom entry — budget accordingly.** The 2
Doom spent on a loyalty card feels steep early in the game, but several of these neutrals
(especially Nori and Shantaks) return that investment within one or two Doom Phases. If you are
already leading on Doom and can afford the tempo cost, purchasing neutrals early gives you more
Doom Phases to recover the entry cost. If you are behind, focus on catching up through Rituals
before spending Doom on loyalty cards.
