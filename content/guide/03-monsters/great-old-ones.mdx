# Great Old Ones

## Overview

Independent Great Old Ones are a category of neutral expansion unit that any faction can purchase during the Action Phase — not during the Doom Phase like neutral monsters and terrors. To awaken most independent GOOs, you must control a Gate in the area where your own faction's Great Old One is present, then pay the listed Power cost. When you awaken one, you receive a loyalty card that ties the GOO to your faction for as long as you hold it.

Each independent GOO comes with a special ability that is active immediately upon awakening, and a spellbook that unlocks when you meet a specific condition. These spellbooks are powerful enough that earning them should be a priority. However, there is a critical risk: if an opponent kills your independent GOO in battle, you lose the loyalty card and the spellbook falls off. At that point, any player can then purchase the same GOO and claim the loyalty for themselves. Keeping your independent GOO alive is not just about preserving a combat unit — it is about protecting a potentially game-defining spellbook.

Unlike neutral monsters and terrors, which cost Doom to recruit, independent GOOs are paid for with Power. The host of the Opening the Way podcast notes this as a meaningful distinction: buying them never threatens to leave you one Doom short of winning the game.

## GOO Pack 1

*Covered in Episode 14: "Stop Faugn With My Elder Signs"*

### Abhoth — The Unclean One

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** Equal to the number of filth tokens currently in play (0 to 12)
**Filth:** 1 Power action. Place a filth token in any area. Filth tokens act as combat 0 monsters belonging to Abhoth's faction. They never move nor take actions, but they can be killed or pained normally in battle and are affected by spellbooks and abilities. There is no stated limit on stacking filth tokens in the same area.
**Spellbook requirement:** Choose one — your faction has 4 or more different monster types in play (including filth tokens), or your faction has 8 or more total monsters in play (including filth tokens).
**Spellbook — The Brood:** Ongoing. Gates in areas containing filth tokens do not count during the Doom phase. This does not apply to Abhoth's own faction.

Abhoth is broadly useful for any faction because the filth ability is essentially a way to deploy up to 12 additional 0-combat bodies anywhere on the map for just 1 Power each. Even before the spellbook comes online, stacking filth tokens around your important units makes those positions dramatically safer to defend — opponents have to battle through a pile of tokens just to reach your real units. Once you earn The Brood, the dynamic becomes threatening for the entire table: any Gate with filth in its area stops generating Doom for your opponents, forcing them to spend actions clearing tokens rather than advancing their own plans. Your own Gates are unaffected. The host strongly recommends prioritizing the spellbook quickly and notes from personal experience that if the table fails to cooperate in clearing filth, it snowballs into a serious problem very fast.

### Cthugha — The Living Flame

**Awaken cost:** Nominal cost 6. Pay an amount equal to 6 minus your current Great Old One's awakening Power cost. If the result is negative, you gain that amount of Power instead. Your Great Old One is then removed and replaced by Cthugha.
**Combat:** Equal to the combat of an enemy Great Old One in the battle (your choice). If no enemy GOO is present, Cthugha's combat is 0.
**Fire Vampires:** Post-battle. If Cthugha is involved in a battle, after all kill results are assigned but before they are applied, you may choose to spare one or more enemy units by reducing their kill to a pain instead. For each unit spared this way, you gain 1 Power. Cannot be used against an enemy player with 0 Power or a hibernating Windwalker.
**Spellbook requirement:** Kill an enemy Great Old One in battle.
**Spellbook — Firestorm:** Post-battle. If Cthugha is involved in a battle, for each killed enemy unit you spare, you also gain 1 Elder Sign (in addition to the 1 Power from Fire Vampires).

Cthugha has a uniquely steep upfront cost — you must sacrifice your own awakened Great Old One to bring her in — but the Power refund mechanic softens this considerably. Factions with expensive GOOs actually benefit most: awakening a 10-cost GOO like Hastur and then swapping to Cthugha nets you 4 Power back. The Daemon Sultan interaction the host highlights is particularly elegant: awaken Tsathoggua for 8 Power, swap for Cthugha to get a 2 Power refund, then reawaken Tsathoggua for 0 or 1 Power — effectively getting Cthugha for free while keeping your faction GOO in play. The payoff loop through Fire Vampires and Firestorm is devastating in the right hands: fight two significant battles, spare two units each time, and you are looking at four Elder Signs, potentially 5 to 7 Doom in a single turn. Aggressive, mobile factions love this — the host calls out Windwalker, Cthulhu with Submerge, and Crawling Chaos as natural fits, with Crawling Chaos's Harbinger plus Firestorm being especially dangerous.

### Mother Hydra

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 6 minus the number of enemy units in the area (minimum 1)
**Agony Sting:** 1 Power action. Choose any ocean area. All enemy Cultists in that area must be moved to adjacent land areas by their owners. Your Cultists are immune. In a dispute over movement order, you decide.
**Spellbook requirement:** Choose one — you control no Great Old Ones in ocean areas, or enemy factions control no Great Old Ones in ocean areas.
**Spellbook — Zygote:** 1 Power action. Take all acolyte Cultists in your pool and place them on the map in any areas where you have a unit.

Mother Hydra's combat stat is a notable weakness — every enemy unit in the same area costs her a die, so she needs clean fights or substantial body support to be effective offensively. The Agony Sting ability is situational and the host acknowledges he has rarely seen it be decisive, though it can disrupt ocean-based Gate strategies when they are present. The real draw is the Zygote spellbook, which is one of the most broadly applicable effects in Pack 1. For 1 Power, you instantly fill all your areas with every Cultist currently sitting in your pool, simultaneously shoring up defenses across your entire board presence. The host flags the spellbook requirement as easy to meet if Cthulhu is not in the game, since no GOO may already be in the ocean. Cthulhu itself is actually the strongest pairing — Shogoths that absorb acolytes can be refueled every turn via Zygote for just 1 Power, creating a repeating cycle of 12-dice Shogoths. Opener of the Way gets an interesting combo as well: after spending Cultists on Favored Ones conversions, Zygote refills the pool instantly. The host also notes that Zygote is simply a strong defensive panic button for any faction — if your GOO is suddenly exposed, 1 Power and three or four Cultists appear as a shield.

### Chaugnar Faugn — The Horror in the Hills

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 3
**Miuri Nigri:** Ongoing. In any battle taking place in an area with your controlled Gate, add +3 combat dice.
**Spellbook requirement:** As your action for a round, discard 2 Elder Signs. You receive no Doom for them.
**Spellbook — The Curse of Chaugnar Faugn:** Ongoing. Turn all Elder Signs in the pool face up. When any player receives an Elder Sign, you pick which one they receive. If you lose this spellbook, turn all Elder Signs face down and mix them up again.

Chaugnar Faugn is a solid defensive combat piece on his own terms: 4 Power for a unit that rolls 3 dice normally and 6 dice when defending a Gate is an efficient rate. But the spellbook is one of the most politically disruptive abilities in the entire game, and the host makes clear he has personally experienced its misery from the receiving end. Once The Curse of Chaugnar Faugn is active, the Elder Sign pool is fully visible and completely under your control — you give yourself 3s every time and hand opponents 1s unless they are offering you something in return. The host recommends treating this as public enemy number one the moment it hits the table: kill Chaugnar or prevent the spellbook from being earned at all costs. The spellbook requirement — discarding 2 Elder Signs and receiving no Doom for them — is the steepest cost in Pack 1, so try to make the discarded signs low-value ones. Factions that are already Doom-rich and ritual frequently are the biggest beneficiaries: Yellow Sign, Windwalker, and Daemon Sultan are all called out specifically, with Daemon Sultan being able to take three 3-value Elder Signs from a single ritual for 9 Doom.

### Yig — Father of Serpents

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 2
**Snakebite:** Post-battle. Your Cultists are poisonous. If any of your Cultists are killed in battle, the enemy receives 1 extra kill result. Only 1 extra kill is dealt regardless of how many of your Cultists die.
**Spellbook requirement:** As your action for a round, remove one of your controlled Gates from the map.
**Spellbook — Messenger of Yig:** Ongoing. In the Doom phase, each other player must decide whether to donate 1 Power from their total to you. For each player who refuses, you gain 1 Doom instead.

Yig is the host's recommended entry point for introducing new players to independent GOOs — his mechanics are clean and his effects are immediately legible. The Snakebite ability is a subtle but real deterrent: any opponent calculating whether to pick a fight with Yig's Cultists has to account for eating an extra kill on top of normal combat results, making your gatekeeper Cultists meaningfully stickier than normal. The spellbook requirement to destroy one of your own Gates is a real cost (losing 3 Power worth of infrastructure), but the host notes you can use this defensively — if you stole a Gate and someone is moving back in to reclaim it, destroy the Gate before they arrive and deny them the objective while keeping your Cultist. Messenger of Yig is consistently strong in any game with three or more opponents: in a four-player game you are likely getting 2 or 3 extra Power every single Doom phase, since players will typically pay the 1 Power rather than hand you free Doom. The host frames this simply as 2 to 3 bonus Power per turn to spend on recruiting Cultists into areas where your poisonous Snakebite will do work. Doom-racing factions that want to turtle and generate passive income benefit most, but any mobile death-ball faction like Windwalker or Cthulhu also appreciates poisonous Cultists that punish opponents who try to pick off cheap units at the front of a push.
