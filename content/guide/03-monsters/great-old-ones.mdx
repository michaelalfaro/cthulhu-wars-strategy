# Great Old Ones

## Overview

Independent Great Old Ones are a category of neutral expansion unit that any faction can purchase during the Action Phase — not during the Doom Phase like neutral monsters and terrors. To awaken most independent GOOs, you must control a Gate in the area where your own faction's Great Old One is present, then pay the listed Power cost. When you awaken one, you receive a loyalty card that ties the GOO to your faction for as long as you hold it.

Each independent GOO comes with a special ability that is active immediately upon awakening, and a spellbook that unlocks when you meet a specific condition. These spellbooks are powerful enough that earning them should be a priority. However, there is a critical risk: if an opponent kills your independent GOO in battle, you lose the loyalty card and the spellbook falls off. At that point, any player can then purchase the same GOO and claim the loyalty for themselves. Keeping your independent GOO alive is not just about preserving a combat unit — it is about protecting a potentially game-defining spellbook.

Unlike neutral monsters and terrors, which cost Doom to recruit, independent GOOs are paid for with Power. The host of the Opening the Way podcast notes this as a meaningful distinction: buying them never threatens to leave you one Doom short of winning the game.

## GOO Pack 1

*Covered in Episode 14: "Stop Faugn With My Elder Signs"*

### Abhoth — The Unclean One

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** Equal to the number of filth tokens currently in play (0 to 12)
**Filth:** 1 Power action. Place a filth token in any area. Filth tokens act as combat 0 monsters belonging to Abhoth's faction. They never move nor take actions, but they can be killed or pained normally in battle and are affected by spellbooks and abilities. There is no stated limit on stacking filth tokens in the same area.
**Spellbook requirement:** Choose one — your faction has 4 or more different monster types in play (including filth tokens), or your faction has 8 or more total monsters in play (including filth tokens).
**Spellbook — The Brood:** Ongoing. Gates in areas containing filth tokens do not count during the Doom phase. This does not apply to Abhoth's own faction.

Abhoth is broadly useful for any faction because the filth ability is essentially a way to deploy up to 12 additional 0-combat bodies anywhere on the map for just 1 Power each. Even before the spellbook comes online, stacking filth tokens around your important units makes those positions dramatically safer to defend — opponents have to battle through a pile of tokens just to reach your real units. Once you earn The Brood, the dynamic becomes threatening for the entire table: any Gate with filth in its area stops generating Doom for your opponents, forcing them to spend actions clearing tokens rather than advancing their own plans. Your own Gates are unaffected. The host strongly recommends prioritizing the spellbook quickly and notes from personal experience that if the table fails to cooperate in clearing filth, it snowballs into a serious problem very fast.

### Cthugha — The Living Flame

**Awaken cost:** Nominal cost 6. Your GOO must be present at a controlled Gate. Pay an amount equal to 6 minus your current Great Old One's awakening Power cost. If the result is negative, you gain that amount of Power instead. Your GOO is then removed and replaced by Cthugha.
**Combat:** Equal to the combat of an enemy Great Old One in the battle (your choice). If no enemy GOO is present, Cthugha's combat is 0.
**Fire Vampires:** Post-battle. If Cthugha is involved in a battle, after all kill results are assigned but before they are applied, you may choose to spare one or more enemy units by reducing their kill to a pain instead. For each unit spared this way, you gain 1 Power. Cannot be used against an enemy player with 0 Power or a hibernating Windwalker.
**Spellbook requirement:** Kill an enemy Great Old One in battle.
**Spellbook — Firestorm:** Post-battle. If Cthugha is involved in a battle, for each killed enemy unit you spare, you also gain 1 Elder Sign (in addition to the 1 Power from Fire Vampires).

Cthugha has a uniquely steep upfront cost — you must sacrifice your own awakened Great Old One to bring her in — but the Power refund mechanic softens this considerably. Factions with expensive GOOs actually benefit most: awakening a 10-cost GOO like Hastur and then swapping to Cthugha nets you 4 Power back. The Daemon Sultan interaction the host highlights is particularly elegant: awaken Thesis for 8 Power, swap for Cthugha to get a 2 Power refund, then reawaken Thesis for 0 or 1 Power — effectively getting Cthugha for free while keeping your faction GOO in play. The payoff loop through Fire Vampires and Firestorm is devastating in the right hands: fight two significant battles, spare two units each time, and you are looking at four Elder Signs, potentially 5 to 7 Doom in an action phase. Aggressive, mobile factions love this — the host calls out Windwalker, Cthulhu with Submerge, and Crawling Chaos as natural fits, with Crawling Chaos's Harbinger plus Firestorm being especially dangerous.

### Mother Hydra

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 6 minus the number of enemy units in the area (minimum 1)
**Agony Sting:** 1 Power action. Choose any ocean area. All enemy Cultists in that area must be moved to adjacent land areas by their owners. Your Cultists are immune. In a dispute over movement order, you decide.
**Spellbook requirement:** Choose one — you control no Great Old Ones in ocean areas, or enemy factions control no Great Old Ones in ocean areas.
**Spellbook — Zygote:** 1 Power action. Take all acolyte Cultists in your pool and place them on the map in any areas where you have a unit.

Mother Hydra's combat stat is a notable weakness — every enemy unit in the same area costs her a die, so she needs clean fights or substantial body support to be effective offensively. The Agony Sting ability is situational and the host acknowledges he has rarely seen it be decisive, though it can disrupt ocean-based Gate strategies when they are present. The real draw is the Zygote spellbook, which is one of the most broadly applicable effects in Pack 1. For 1 Power, you instantly fill all your areas with every Cultist currently sitting in your pool, simultaneously shoring up defenses across your entire board presence. The host flags the spellbook requirement as easy to meet if Cthulhu is not in the game, since no GOO may already be in the ocean. Cthulhu itself is actually the strongest pairing — Shogoths that absorb acolytes can be refueled every turn via Zygote for just 1 Power, creating a repeating cycle of 12-dice Shogoths. Opener of the Way gets an interesting combo as well: after spending Cultists on Favored Ones conversions, Zygote refills the pool instantly. Yellow Sign with Passion and Black Goat are also strong pairings, since both benefit from Cultists being killed or returned to the pool, letting Zygote immediately replenish what was spent. The host also notes that Zygote is simply a strong defensive panic button for any faction — if your GOO is suddenly exposed, 1 Power and three or four Cultists appear as a shield.

### Chaugnar Faugn — The Horror in the Hills

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 3
**Miuri Nigri:** Ongoing. In any battle taking place in an area with your controlled Gate, add +3 combat dice.
**Spellbook requirement:** As your action for a round, discard 2 Elder Signs. You receive no Doom for them.
**Spellbook — The Curse of Chaugnar Faugn:** Ongoing. Turn all Elder Signs in the pool face up. When any player receives an Elder Sign, you pick which one they receive. If you lose this spellbook, turn all Elder Signs face down and mix them up again.

Chaugnar Faugn is a solid defensive combat piece on his own terms: 4 Power for a unit that rolls 3 dice normally and 6 dice when defending a Gate is an efficient rate. But the spellbook is one of the most politically disruptive abilities in the entire game, and the host makes clear he has personally experienced its misery from the receiving end. Once The Curse of Chaugnar Faugn is active, the Elder Sign pool is fully visible and completely under your control — you give yourself 3s every time and hand opponents 1s unless they are offering you something in return. The host recommends treating this as public enemy number one the moment it hits the table: kill Chaugnar or prevent the spellbook from being earned at all costs. The spellbook requirement — discarding 2 Elder Signs and receiving no Doom for them — is the steepest cost in Pack 1, so try to make the discarded signs low-value ones. Factions that are already Doom-rich and ritual frequently are the biggest beneficiaries: Yellow Sign, Windwalker, and Daemon Sultan are all called out specifically, with Daemon Sultan being able to take three 3-value Elder Signs from a single ritual for six to nine Doom.

### Yig — Father of Serpents

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 2
**Snakebite:** Post-battle. Your Cultists are poisonous. If any of your Cultists are killed in battle, the enemy receives 1 extra kill result. Only 1 extra kill is dealt regardless of how many of your Cultists die.
**Spellbook requirement:** As your action for a round, remove one of your controlled Gates from the map.
**Spellbook — Messenger of Yig:** Ongoing. In the Doom phase, each other player must decide whether to donate 1 Power from their total to you. For each player who refuses, you gain 1 Doom instead.

Yig is the host's recommended entry point for introducing new players to independent GOOs — his mechanics are clean and his effects are immediately legible. The Snakebite ability is a subtle but real deterrent: any opponent calculating whether to pick a fight with Yig's Cultists has to account for eating an extra kill on top of normal combat results, making your gatekeeper Cultists meaningfully stickier than normal. The spellbook requirement to destroy one of your own Gates is a real cost (losing 3 Power worth of infrastructure), but the host notes you can use this defensively — if you stole a Gate and someone is moving back in to reclaim it, destroy the Gate before they arrive and deny them the objective while keeping your Cultist. Messenger of Yig is consistently strong in any game with three or more opponents: in a four-player game you are likely getting 2 or 3 extra Power every single Doom phase, since players will typically pay the 1 Power rather than hand you free Doom. The host frames this simply as 2 to 3 bonus Power per turn to spend on recruiting Cultists into areas where your poisonous Snakebite will do work. Doom-racing factions that want to turtle and generate passive income benefit most, but any mobile death-ball faction like Windwalker or Cthulhu also appreciates poisonous Cultists that punish opponents who try to pick off cheap units at the front of a push.

## GOO Pack 2

*Covered in Episode 16: "Weaving a Worldwide Web"*

### Atlach-Nacha — The Spinner in Darkness

**Awaken cost:** 6 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 4
**Spinnerets:** 1 Power action. If Atlach-Nacha is in an area that does not contain a web token, place one there.
**Spellbook requirement:** Web tokens are in six different areas.
**Spellbook — Cosmic Web:** 0 Power action. Immediately win the game, even if you have fewer than six faction Spellbooks.

Cosmic Web is one of only a handful of alternate win conditions in Cthulhu Wars, and it deserves to be treated as a genuine threat from the moment Atlach-Nacha hits the table. The core challenge is that placing six webs across six different areas requires both significant Power (6 Power for the webs alone, plus movement costs) and time, making the full setup expensive. In practice, the host notes that the win rarely comes from a single player completing the web uncontested — opponents will start hunting Atlach-Nacha once three or four webs are down. Critically, web tokens do not disappear when Atlach-Nacha changes hands: when a player loses the loyalty card and another buys Atlach-Nacha, the new owner inherits all previously placed webs, so killing Atlach-Nacha merely transfers the threat rather than eliminating it. The host recommends Windwalker as the best faction for this strategy, since a roaming death ball can protect Atlach-Nacha during the web-laying process and the Power surplus from hibernation covers the high action cost. Any faction with cheap or free movement similarly benefits. The host encourages players who have never tried this one to give it a go, calling it genuinely fun — especially on the Dreamlands map, where it creates a three-way race between Doom, alternate map win condition, and the web win.

### Bokrug — The Great Water Lizard

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 1
**Ghost of Ib:** Ongoing. If Bokrug is killed, you do not lose this loyalty card. Instead, place Bokrug's figure on this card. At the end of the next Doom phase, return Bokrug to any area of the map that does not contain any enemy units. If no such area exists, Bokrug remains on this card until the next Doom phase.
**Spellbook requirement:** Take this loyalty card and give it to a player of your choice. That player then places Bokrug's Spellbook on this card.
**Spellbook — The Doom That Came to Sarnath:** Doom phase ability. At the end of the Doom phase, the player holding this loyalty card selects an enemy and applies one of two effects: that enemy chooses one of your monsters or Cultists to eliminate, or that enemy chooses one of your face-down Elder Signs to discard.

Bokrug is unlike any other independent GOO — it is a poison pill designed to be passed around the table as much as wielded as a weapon. The player who first purchases Bokrug holds a 1-combat GOO that is nearly impossible to kill permanently thanks to Ghost of Ib, and can threaten to give the loyalty card (and its attached Spellbook) to whoever comes near. That threat alone has defensive value: opponents have to weigh whether attacking the Gate is worth becoming the next recipient of The Doom That Came to Sarnath. Once the Spellbook is on the card, the receiving player faces a nasty recurring drain every Doom phase — the host notes that losing a monster or Cultist is usually preferable to losing an Elder Sign, since the opponent chooses which of your face-down signs is discarded (effectively random, potentially costing 2 or 3 Doom). The way to stop the penalty is to get Bokrug killed: killing it causes the Spellbook to fall off the loyalty card, but Ghost of Ib means you do not lose the loyalty card itself — Bokrug goes onto the card and returns to the original holder at the end of the Doom phase, so there is no new owner starting fresh. The host flags this as a rattlesnake-style GOO with a lot of social dynamics at play — ideal for players who enjoy political board states.

### Father Dagon

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 2 on land; 6 in ocean areas
**Tsunami:** 1 Power action. Choose a land area adjacent to an ocean area. All Cultists in that area must be moved into adjacent ocean areas by their owners. This includes your own Cultists. In a dispute over movement order, you decide.
**Spellbook requirement:** You have 8 units in ocean areas.
**Spellbook — Innsmouth Look:** Doom phase, ongoing. During the Doom phase, remove one of your acolyte Cultists from the map permanently (out of the game). Gain 6 Power. This is not optional. If you have no acolyte Cultists on the map, there is no effect.

Father Dagon is the ocean specialist of Pack 2 — fragile on land at 2 combat but formidable in the water at 6. Tsunami mirrors Mother Hydra's Agony Sting in reverse: where Hydra pushes Cultists out of ocean areas, Dagon can pull them in. This is most effective against factions trying to turtle on a cluster of land Gates, since Tsunami can scatter their acolytes into the water and disrupt their board position. The spellbook requirement of 8 units in ocean areas is not trivial for all factions, but the host notes that if you are already using Tsunami on your own Cultists you can set up the position without excessive extra movement cost. Once Innsmouth Look comes online, the effect is powerful but has a real ceiling: every use permanently removes one of your acolytes from the game, which shrinks your Gate cap. The host advises tracking how many Cultists you have left and only using this freely when the game is near its end — ideally when the current Doom phase will fund a Ritual. Cthulhu is the natural pairing, since the faction is already in the ocean and should meet the spellbook requirement almost automatically. Any ritual-heavy faction that wants extra Power for a decisive Doom phase play also benefits, but the host cautions not to sacrifice more than two or three Cultists total unless you are confident the game will end soon.

### Ghatanothoa

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** Equal to the number of Cultists the targeted opponent has on the map
**Mummify:** 1 Power action. Any enemy acolyte Cultists sharing an area with Ghatanothoa are immediately mummified. Lay mummified Cultist figures on their sides. Mummified Cultists cannot use the move action, do not participate in battle, and produce no Power during the next Gather Power phase. During the Doom phase, stand any mummified Cultists back up. A mummified Cultist can be captured. If a Cultist controlled a Gate before being mummified, it retains control of that Gate.
**Spellbook requirement:** Either you have fewer than 6 total Gates and Cultists during the Doom phase, or as an action, pay 4 Power.
**Spellbook — Execration of Mu:** Ongoing. The Mummify ability is no longer a paid action. Instead, it occurs instantly whenever any enemy acolyte Cultists share an area with Ghatanothoa.

Ghatanothoa's variable combat stat is context-sensitive but generally strong — fighting against Cthulhu or Black Goat with many Cultists on the map means Ghatanothoa can be rolling 5 or 6 dice. Mummify is excellent for neutralizing clustered Cultist positions: factions that stack acolytes around a Gate as meat shields suddenly find all of them taken offline simultaneously for 1 Power. The spellbook requirement is flexible — the pay-4-Power option means any faction can earn it on demand without needing to be in a specific board state. Once Execration of Mu is active, the mummify effect triggers instantly at no cost whenever an enemy acolyte Cultist enters or starts in Ghatanothoa's area, completely shutting down that area for any Cultist-dependent strategy. The host notes that mobile factions like Crawling Chaos, which can range across the board and bring Ghatanothoa into contested areas, get the most value — it turns any area Ghatanothoa occupies into a no-Cultist zone that opponents have to resolve with monsters or GOOs.

## GOO Pack 4

*Covered in Episode 26: "Seeing Double"*

### Byatis — The Serpent-Bearded (God of Forgetfulness)

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 4
**Toad of Berkeley:** Ongoing. Byatis may not move, nor can he be moved with movement-type abilities such as Arctic Wind or Submerge. He can still be pained. If there are no enemy units in Byatis' area during the Doom phase, receive 1 Elder Sign.
**Spellbook requirement:** Byatis survives a battle in which at least one enemy unit is killed.
**Spellbook — God of Forgetfulness:** 1 Power action. Select all enemy Cultists in an area adjacent to Byatis. Those Cultists are moved into Byatis' area.

Byatis is a stationary 4-cost, 4-combat GOO that generates passive Elder Signs simply by being left alone. For factions that plan to hold a Gate and avoid early conflicts, that passive income is essentially free: place Byatis on a secure Gate and collect 1 Elder Sign per Doom phase for the rest of the game. The host notes that if Byatis earns even two Elder Signs before the game ends, it has paid for itself many times over in Doom value. The Toad of Berkeley's immobility is a real constraint — Byatis cannot be repositioned once placed, so Gate selection matters at awakening. The spellbook requirement runs counter to the passive Elder Sign incentive: you need someone to come fight you. At 4 combat Byatis is capable of winning those battles, and the host suggests simply letting attackers come to you and earning the spellbook opportunistically rather than chasing it. God of Forgetfulness is strong once active: dragging adjacent enemy Cultists into Byatis' area feeds his combat (he fights whoever you drag in next turn), forces opponents to spend Power moving Cultists away, and denies them safe positions adjacent to your Gate. The host calls out Crawling Chaos as a particularly good fit because Madness can pain units into adjacent areas that can then be pulled into Byatis' zone, and also recommends defensive factions like Tcho-Tcho or Opener of the Way and ritual-heavy factions like Yellow Sign that want steady Elder Sign income to fund aggressive rituals.

### Nyogtha — The Thing That Should Not Be

**Awaken cost:** 6 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One; place all Nyogtha units from the pool)
**Combat:** 4 if Nyogtha's faction declared the battle; 1 if not
**From Below:** Ongoing. Nyogtha is two units. Any common action involving one of these units can be applied simultaneously to the other as part of the same action and at no extra cost. When one Nyogtha moves, so may the other. When one captures a Cultist, so may the other. If battle is declared in one's area, you can also declare a battle in the other's area for free. You only lose this loyalty card if both Nyogtha units have been killed.
**Spellbook requirement:** Nyogtha survives a battle against an enemy Great Old One.
**Spellbook — Nightmare Web:** Ongoing. If one of the Nyogtha units is in your pool, you can awaken it for 2 Power, placing it in any area in which you have a unit.

The host names Nyogtha as one of his favorite neutral units in the entire game and says he will buy it whenever it is available. The appeal is straightforward: you are getting two 4-combat GOOs for 6 Power when you declare battles, and every action one Nyogtha takes can be simultaneously applied to the other at no extra cost. One Power moves both; one Power captures with both; one action battles in both areas. This Power efficiency is exceptional and benefits any faction, but it is especially good for factions that care about every Power saved — the host specifically calls out the ability to double-capture Cultists in a single action as a major accelerant for any doom-rushing strategy. The dual-unit rule means Nyogtha is also very hard to destroy: you keep the loyalty card until both units are killed, so losing one in a fight does not cost you the spellbook. For the spellbook requirement, the host recommends marching both Nyogtha units (8 combined dice when you declare) against an enemy GOO, ideally with one extra unit as a buffer. Once Nightmare Web is active, re-summoning a lost Nyogtha costs only 2 Power to any area where you have a unit, making the pair nearly self-sustaining. The host considers this universally strong: aggressive factions love the 8-die death ball, and defensive factions love having two GOOs to anchor two separate Gates simultaneously.

### Tulzscha

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 1
**Undying Flame:** Gather Power phase ability. At the end of the Gather Power phase, gain 1 Doom if at least 1 faction has more Doom than you; gain 1 Elder Sign if at least 1 faction has more Elder Signs than you; gain 1 Power if at least 1 faction has more Power than you.
**Spellbook requirement:** As your action for a round, each enemy faction earns 2 Power.
**Spellbook — Ceremony of Annihilation:** Doom phase ability. When you perform a Ritual of Annihilation, you may choose to pay nothing and instead earn Power equal to the current position of the Ritual of Annihilation marker, then advance the marker by one step. You earn no extra Doom or Elder Signs from this ritual.

Tulzscha is a catch-up engine that rewards you for being behind and punishes you for running too far ahead. At 1 combat, she is not a fighter — she is a passive value generator that delivers Doom, Elder Signs, and Power based on the gap between you and the leading players. The host frames this as genuinely useful for any player who is not completely dominating: if you are trailing on Doom and Elder Signs simultaneously, a single Gather Power phase nets you 2 or even 3 resources for a 4-Power investment. If you manage to do that for multiple turns in a row, Tulzscha has paid for herself several times over. The spellbook requirement costs you nothing in terms of your own Power — giving 2 Power to each enemy is the action, and you spend zero yourself, meaning you walk in place rather than fall behind. Ceremony of Annihilation is most potent when the Ritual marker is high (6 or 7) and you have been pushed off Gates: skip paying the ritual cost entirely, pocket 6 or 7 Power, and advance the marker to make the next ritual even more expensive for opponents who still need to do it. The host notes this combo also denies opponents a ritual when you go first in the turn order, since each marker advance raises the cost for everyone. No specific faction is called out as a standout pairing — the host considers Tulzscha broadly useful to any faction that is not already crushing, which covers most board states for most of a game.

## GOO Pack 3

*No podcast episode covers GOO Pack 3. This profile is sourced from the Cthulhu Wars Strategy Wiki.*

### Gobogeg — The Moon Lens

**Awaken cost:** 0 Power. Prerequisites: at least one player has 6 Faction Spellbooks; your controlled Gate is in an area with your Great Old One.
**Combat:** 0 dice. If Gobogeg is Killed or Pained, all units in the area are Pained (regardless of faction).
**Book of Law (Ongoing):** While Gobogeg is in play, whenever a Great Old One is Awakened, the owner receives 6 Power after the Awakening.
**Spellbook requirement:** Someone wins the game (need not be you).
**Spellbook — Book of Chaos (Post-Game):** If the game ends while you control Gobogeg, YOU get to pick the Factions, Expansions, Map, Neutral Monsters, and Independent Great Old Ones to be used the next time your group plays Cthulhu Wars.

Gobogeg costs nothing to awaken but carries a late-game prerequisite — someone at the table must have collected all 6 of their Faction Spellbooks before Gobogeg can enter play. In practice this means Gobogeg typically arrives in the mid-to-late game, once at least one faction has completed its spellbook track. The real payoff is Book of Law, which creates a powerful chain incentive around independent GOO awakening: since most independent GOOs cost 4 Power to awaken and Book of Law refunds 6 Power to whoever awakens one, each indie GOO purchased while Gobogeg is in play nets the buyer +2 Power. This creates a snowball dynamic where the optimal line is to awaken Gobogeg and then race to purchase as many independent GOOs as possible, profiting 2 Power on each transaction. At 0 combat, Gobogeg is not a fighter — it is a deterrent piece. The area-of-effect pain mechanic means that whenever Gobogeg is Killed or Pained, every unit in the area regardless of faction is also Pained. Opponents attacking into Gobogeg's area risk having their entire concentrated army scattered, which makes positioning Gobogeg alongside a defensive stack an effective way to discourage aggression. Book of Chaos is purely a meta-game reward with no in-game Doom value, but the social and competitive leverage of choosing every variable for the next session is significant in regular play groups. Factions that can protect Gobogeg while exploiting Book of Law benefit most — any faction with spare Power and interest in accumulating independent GOOs is a natural fit, and factions with strong defensive positioning can ensure Gobogeg survives long enough for the Power chain to pay off.

## Ramsey Campbell Horrors 1

*The first Ramsey Campbell Horrors pack introduces two GOOs with unconventional Cultist-based mechanics that fundamentally alter how your faction generates and spends resources.*

### Eihort — God of the Labyrinth

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 0
**The Brood:** Upon awakening Eihort, replace all of your Acolyte Cultists currently on the map with Brood tokens. Brood tokens cost 1 Power to recruit, have 1 Combat, and cannot move.
**Spellbook requirement:** You have Brood tokens in 4 or more areas.
**Spellbook — Unclean Bargain:** Doom Phase. Convert any number of your Acolyte Cultists on the map into Brood tokens.

Eihort fundamentally transforms the way your faction interacts with Cultists. The moment Eihort awakens, every Acolyte Cultist you have on the map becomes a Brood token — a stationary 1-combat unit that can control Gates and participate in battles but can never move. This is a drastic trade-off: you gain immediate combat presence across your entire board position (1 die each instead of the 0 that Acolytes normally roll), but you permanently sacrifice the flexibility to reposition those units. The Brood's immobility means that your initial Gate placement and Cultist positioning at the time of awakening effectively locks in your territorial footprint for the rest of the game. Factions that spread wide early — like Crawling Chaos or Black Goat — benefit most because they convert a large number of Cultists across many areas, making the spellbook requirement of Brood in 4 or more areas easier to meet. Unclean Bargain extends this mechanic into the Doom Phase, letting you convert freshly recruited Acolytes into additional Brood tokens each turn, which creates a steady drip of combat-capable defenders at Gates you want to hold permanently. The risk is clear: if an opponent displaces your Brood from a Gate, you cannot simply walk replacements back in. Eihort rewards players who commit to a defensive posture and plan their Gate network before awakening rather than after.

### Gla'aki — The Inhabitant of the Lake

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** Equal to the number of Acolyte Cultists currently in your pool
**The Tomb-Herd:** Gather Power Phase. Earn 1 Power per Acolyte Cultist in your pool.
**Spellbook requirement:** You have 3 or more Acolyte Cultists in your pool.
**Spellbook — Green Decay:** When enemy Cultists captured by your units are sacrificed (returned to the enemy's pool), you gain 1 Elder Sign instead of the standard Power reward.

Gla'aki creates an inverse economy where having Cultists off the map is more valuable than having them deployed. Every Acolyte sitting in your pool generates 1 Power during the Gather Power Phase via The Tomb-Herd, and Gla'aki's combat stat scales with that same pool count — so a faction with 4 Cultists in reserve is fielding a 4-combat GOO that also earns 4 bonus Power per turn. This creates a genuine strategic tension: deploying Cultists to control Gates costs you both Power income and combat dice on Gla'aki, while pulling Cultists back to the pool strengthens your GOO but sacrifices Gate control. The spellbook requirement of 3 or more Acolytes in pool is easy to meet if you intentionally hold back recruits, and Green Decay is where the real payoff arrives — converting captured Cultist sacrifices into Elder Signs instead of Power turns every successful capture into Doom progress. Factions that excel at capturing enemy Cultists, such as Crawling Chaos with Madness or any faction running Great Race of Yith, can chain Elder Signs rapidly once Green Decay is active. The ideal deployment pattern is to hold most of your Acolytes in reserve, control just enough Gates to stay competitive, and use Gla'aki's inflated combat stat and the Power surplus from Tomb-Herd to fund aggressive capturing raids that feed Green Decay.

## Ramsey Campbell Horrors 2

*The second Ramsey Campbell Horrors pack features two of the most disruptive GOOs in the game — one that shuts down enemy GOOs entirely, and one that refuses to stay dead.*

### Daoloth — The Render of the Veils

**Awaken cost:** 6 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 0
**Cosmic Unity (Pre-Battle):** In a Battle involving Daoloth, choose one enemy Great Old One present. That GOO rolls no Combat dice for the duration of the battle.
**Spellbook requirement:** A Great Old One is killed anywhere on the map.
**Spellbook — Interdimensional (Ongoing):** Whenever Daoloth enters an Area that does not contain a Gate, immediately place a Gate there controlled by Daoloth's faction.

Daoloth is a 6-Power investment that rolls zero combat dice but brings two of the most powerful control effects available on any independent GOO. Cosmic Unity is a pre-battle shutdown that strips all combat dice from a single enemy Great Old One in the same area — against factions that depend heavily on their GOO's combat stat, this is devastating. Cthulhu at 6 combat, Hastur at variable high values, or even another independent GOO like Nyogtha at 4 combat all become dead weight when Daoloth is in the fight. The key is that Daoloth itself needs allied units to provide the actual combat dice, so it functions best as a force multiplier rather than a standalone threat. The spellbook requirement — any GOO being killed anywhere — is largely out of your direct control but tends to happen naturally in most games by the mid-game. Once Interdimensional comes online, Daoloth transforms into a map-control engine: every area Daoloth moves into without an existing Gate immediately receives one under your control. This means a single move action can simultaneously expand your Gate network, generate additional Power income, and provide new Ritual Doom capacity. Mobile factions that can escort Daoloth across multiple areas in a turn — Crawling Chaos with Flight or Windwalker with Arctic Wind — can exploit Interdimensional to build a sprawling Gate network in a single Action Phase. The combination of GOO suppression and free Gate generation makes Daoloth one of the highest-impact independent GOOs for factions that can protect a 0-combat unit.

### Y'Golonac — The Defiler

**Awaken cost:** 2 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 1
**Orifices (Post-Battle):** If Y'Golonac is Killed in Battle, select a surviving enemy Terror, Monster, or Cultist in the battle area and replace it with Y'Golonac. Y'Golonac is now controlled by that unit's former owner.
**Spellbook requirement:** Receive Y'Golonac through the Orifices ability (another player must have Y'Golonac killed, and it must possess one of your units).
**Spellbook — The Revelations (Doom Phase):** Every player except Y'Golonac's current owner gains 1 Elder Sign.

Y'Golonac is the cheapest independent GOO in the game at just 2 Power and arguably the most socially chaotic. The core mechanic is Orifices: when Y'Golonac dies in battle, it does not go to the pool — it possesses a surviving enemy unit, replacing that unit entirely and transferring Y'Golonac's loyalty card to the enemy player. This means the player who kills Y'Golonac is punished by inheriting it, losing one of their own units in the process. The result is a hot-potato dynamic where no one wants to be the one holding Y'Golonac when The Revelations triggers, because the spellbook hands every other player at the table 1 Elder Sign during each Doom Phase — a massive collective advantage that accelerates everyone except the holder. The spellbook requirement is unique: you earn it not by doing something yourself but by having Y'Golonac forced onto you through Orifices. This creates a perverse incentive structure where the initial buyer wants Y'Golonac to die quickly so it becomes someone else's problem, and the recipient wants to kill it again to pass it along further. Factions that can engineer battles where Y'Golonac dies reliably — high-combat factions like Great Cthulhu or Windwalker — can weaponize the possession chain, while factions that struggle to get rid of it once they have it suffer the most from The Revelations drain.

## Masks of Nyarlathotep

*The Masks of Nyarlathotep expansion introduces GOOs themed around avatar forms of Nyarlathotep, each bringing economic warfare and scaling combat to the table.*

### The Bloated Woman — The Fertile Crescent

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 1
**The Velvet Fan:** Ongoing. When enemy units are killed in a battle involving The Bloated Woman, those units are captured instead of returning to the enemy pool. The recruitment cost to re-summon those captured units is paid to The Bloated Woman's controller.
**Spellbook requirement:** You have captured 3 or more enemy units via The Velvet Fan.
**Spellbook — Disaster Looms:** Ongoing. Your Gates earn Elder Signs instead of Power during the Gather Power Phase.

The Bloated Woman is an economic warfare specialist that converts every battle into a resource drain on the opponent and a resource gain for her controller. The Velvet Fan changes the fundamental calculus of combat: killed enemy units do not simply return to the enemy pool — they are captured, and when the opponent wants to recruit those units again, the Power cost goes to you instead of being lost to the bank. This means every fight involving The Bloated Woman generates a sustained income stream as opponents are forced to buy back their own monsters and Cultists at their listed recruitment cost, with the payment flowing directly into your Power reserves. At only 1 combat, The Bloated Woman herself is not a damage dealer — she needs allied combat support to generate kills, similar to Quachil Uttaus. The spellbook requirement of capturing 3 enemy units through The Velvet Fan is achievable in two to three battles with adequate dice support. Once Disaster Looms activates, your entire economy pivots: Gates produce Elder Signs instead of Power, which means every Gate you control is now generating Doom progress directly rather than funding actions. This is an extraordinarily powerful late-game effect, but it comes with a critical downside — you lose your normal Power income from Gates, making you entirely dependent on The Velvet Fan captures and other Power sources for actions. Factions with alternative Power generation, such as Crawling Chaos or Windwalker, can sustain operations while Disaster Looms converts their Gate network into a Doom engine.

### The Haunter of the Dark — The Winged Shadow

**Awaken cost:** 6 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** Equal to the number of enemy spellbooks earned across all opponents
**Fly-the-Light:** Ongoing. Whenever a single kill result must be assigned in a battle involving The Haunter of the Dark, enemies must target The Haunter first before assigning kills to other units.
**Spellbook requirement:** An enemy faction earns its 6th Spellbook.
**Spellbook — The Shining Trapezohedron:** Post-battle. After a battle involving The Haunter of the Dark, each enemy player with units in the battle rolls a die for each of their surviving units. On a result of 6, that unit is eliminated.

The Haunter of the Dark is a late-game scaling threat whose combat value increases as opponents progress through their spellbook tracks. In a four-player game where each faction has earned 3 to 4 spellbooks, The Haunter rolls 12 to 16 combat dice — more than almost any other unit in the game. This makes it a monster in the final phases when spellbooks are plentiful, but relatively modest in the early game when few spellbooks have been earned. The 6 Power awakening cost reflects this ceiling, and timing the purchase to coincide with the mid-to-late spellbook surge is essential to getting full value. Fly-the-Light functions as a lightning rod: enemies must assign their single kill results to The Haunter before targeting any other unit in the battle, which paradoxically protects your other units. If The Haunter absorbs a kill, your monsters, Cultists, and faction GOO survive, and you can re-purchase The Haunter later. The spellbook requirement — an enemy earning their 6th Spellbook — triggers naturally as the game progresses, making it one of the easiest spellbook conditions to meet passively. The Shining Trapezohedron adds a devastating post-battle punishment: every surviving enemy unit in the battle area rolls a die, and any 6 results in that unit being eliminated. In large battles with many surviving enemies, the statistical expected value of this ability is significant and can strip an opponent's board presence after what they thought was a favorable fight. Combat-heavy factions that seek out large engagements maximize the Trapezohedron's value.

## Onslaught Three

*The Onslaught Three expansion introduces "Dire" versions of existing Great Old Ones — massively powerful, expensive units designed as endgame plays with game-defining effects.*

### Dire Azathoth — The Nuclear Chaos

**Awaken cost:** 10 Power (your controlled Gate must be on an enemy faction's starting area; your Great Old One must be present)
**Combat:** 1d6 (roll one die; the result is Dire Azathoth's combat value for that battle)
**Mindless Destruction:** Ongoing. Any Faction battling in Dire Azathoth's Area gains Dire Azathoth's controller's choice of 1 Doom or 1 Power per unit Killed or Eliminated in that battle.
**Spellbook requirement:** Control 3 Gates simultaneously while Dire Azathoth is in play.
**Spellbook — The Blind Idiot God:** Action. Pay 20 Power to immediately win the game.

Dire Azathoth is the most expensive independent GOO in the entire game at 10 Power, with the most demanding awakening prerequisite — you must control a Gate on an enemy faction's starting area, which requires you to have pushed deep into hostile territory. The variable combat stat of 1d6 means Dire Azathoth can roll anywhere from 1 to 6 dice in a given battle, introducing a level of randomness that no other GOO has. Mindless Destruction is a double-edged sword: every unit killed or eliminated in Dire Azathoth's area earns the battling faction either 1 Doom or 1 Power per casualty, but the choice belongs to Dire Azathoth's controller. This means you can feed opponents Doom when you want to accelerate the game toward its end, or feed them Power when you want to keep them from ritual-threatening positions — but critically, this also means enemies who fight in Dire Azathoth's area can benefit from the carnage. The real headline is The Blind Idiot God: pay 20 Power to win the game immediately. This is the most extreme alternate win condition available — 20 Power is an enormous sum that requires either multiple turns of hoarding or a faction with exceptional Power generation, but it bypasses the Doom track entirely. Factions with strong Power economies, such as Opener of the Way or any faction running Tulzscha, can realistically assemble 20 Power in the late game. The entire table must treat this as a credible threat once Dire Azathoth's spellbook is earned, forcing opponents to either kill Dire Azathoth or keep the controller's Power below 20 at all times.

### Dire Cthulhu — The Dreaming God

**Awaken cost:** 6 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One). Upon awakening, gain 1 Elder Sign.
**Combat:** 3
**Lord and Master (Ongoing):** Whenever you Awaken an Independent Great Old One (other than Dire Cthulhu), gain 1 Elder Sign.
**Spellbook requirement:** Kill 3 enemy units in a single battle.
**Spellbook — Non-Euclidean (Post-Battle):** After a battle in Dire Cthulhu's area, you may assign all battle results (kills and pains) to any units belonging to any faction present in the area, regardless of which faction rolled them.

Dire Cthulhu is an Elder Sign generation engine built around the independent GOO awakening chain. The immediate 1 Elder Sign upon awakening means you are already earning Doom progress from the moment you pay the 6 Power cost, and Lord and Master extends this to every subsequent independent GOO you purchase — each one nets an additional Elder Sign on top of whatever value the GOO itself provides. In a game with multiple independent GOOs available, a player who awakens Dire Cthulhu early and then purchases two or three more GOOs can accumulate 3 to 4 Elder Signs purely from the chain, representing a massive Doom swing. This synergizes powerfully with Gobogeg's Book of Law, which refunds 6 Power for each GOO awakened — the combination means each new GOO costs effectively nothing while generating Elder Signs. The spellbook requirement of killing 3 enemy units in a single battle demands a concentrated combat push, which at 3 combat Dire Cthulhu can contribute to meaningfully. Once Non-Euclidean is earned, the post-battle result reassignment is devastating: you choose how all kills and pains from both sides are distributed among all units in the area, meaning you can redirect your own pain results onto enemy units and redirect enemy kill results onto their own allies. This makes large multi-faction battles in Dire Cthulhu's area overwhelmingly favorable for the controller. Factions that plan to invest heavily in independent GOOs across the game — especially those that can protect multiple GOOs simultaneously — extract the most value from Lord and Master.

## Something About Cats

*The Something About Cats expansion introduces Elder Gods — a unit type distinct from Independent Great Old Ones, with potentially different rules for awakening, loyalty, and interaction with other game effects.*

### Hagarg Ryonis — The Lier-in-Wait (Cat from Jupiter)

**Type:** Elder God (not an Independent Great Old One)
**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 3 Pains (Hagarg Ryonis rolls no dice; instead, it automatically inflicts 3 Pain results in every battle)
**Subversion (First Player Phase):** Choose a player. If that player performs a Ritual of Annihilation during the upcoming Doom Phase, steal 1 Elder Sign they would earn from the Ritual.
**Spellbook requirement:** Use the Subversion ability 3 times.
**Spellbook — Laziness:** Action. Choose a player. That player immediately loses 2 Power.

Hagarg Ryonis occupies a unique design space as an Elder God rather than an Independent Great Old One, which may carry distinct rules implications depending on the expansion set being used — players should verify how Elder Gods interact with effects that specifically target "Independent GOOs" or "Great Old Ones" in their game's configuration. The combat mechanic is immediately distinctive: instead of rolling dice, Hagarg Ryonis automatically inflicts 3 Pain results every battle, with no variance and no dice. This makes it a guaranteed area-denial tool — opponents know exactly what they are getting when they fight into an area containing Hagarg Ryonis, and 3 Pains means three of their units will be displaced regardless of how many dice they roll. The absence of kill results means Hagarg Ryonis cannot destroy units directly, but the consistent Pain output can shatter an opponent's board position by scattering their concentrated forces. Subversion is a targeted ritual disruption: during the First Player Phase, you designate an opponent, and if they perform a Ritual of Annihilation that Doom Phase, you steal 1 Elder Sign from their haul. Over multiple Doom Phases, this can strip 2 to 3 Elder Signs from a ritual-heavy opponent, representing a serious Doom swing. The spellbook requirement of using Subversion 3 times means you need the game to last at least three Doom Phases after awakening, which incentivizes an early purchase. Laziness provides targeted Power denial — forcing an opponent to lose 2 Power as your action can cripple a tight Power budget and prevent key purchases or movements. Factions that value board control and attrition over raw kills benefit most from Hagarg Ryonis's guaranteed Pain output.

## General Tips for Independent GOOs

**Buy with Power, not Doom.** Unlike neutral monsters and terrors, independent GOOs are purchased with Power during the Action Phase. This means they never compete with Doom-spending and never put you one point short of winning. You can add one to your plans without the cost-of-entry penalty that comes with Doom-based neutrals.

**Timing matters more than the unit.** The right turn to awaken a GOO is when your Power budget has slack and your Great Old One is already in a well-defended position at a controlled Gate. Awakening on a shoestring means you cannot respond to the board state afterward. The host generally recommends not committing to a GOO purchase unless you can still afford at least one or two meaningful follow-up actions in the same phase.

**Your spellbook lives or dies with your GOO.** If an opponent kills your independent GOO, you lose the loyalty card and the spellbook falls off. At that point, anyone can purchase the GOO and claim the loyalty themselves. Protecting your independent GOO is not optional once the spellbook is active — position it with other units, keep it in areas where combat will be costly for attackers, and avoid stretching it out as a solo forward scout.

**The table adapts to alternate win conditions.** Atlach-Nacha and Cosmic Web in particular change the entire threat landscape of the game: once three or four webs are down, all opponents will begin prioritizing Atlach-Nacha's destruction. Plan for the web strategy to draw heat, and have a fallback plan if the alternate win fails. The risk-reward calculus favors patience: lay webs opportunistically rather than telegraphing the win several turns in advance.

**High-cost GOOs need a clear plan.** Nyogtha at 6 Power and Atlach-Nacha at 6 Power are significant investments relative to a normal game Power budget. Before committing, identify what specific advantage the GOO unlocks for your faction that your current units do not provide. Awakening a 6-cost GOO in a tight Power turn and then not using its abilities for two or three phases means the purchase has been largely wasted. The host consistently returns to the idea that independent GOOs need to be working for you from the moment they hit the board.

**The Ramsey Campbell GOOs play by unusual rules — read them twice.** The GOOs from both Ramsey Campbell Horrors packs (Eihort, Gla'aki, Daoloth, Y'Golonac) feature mechanics that subvert standard assumptions about how units, Cultists, and combat work. Eihort replaces your entire Cultist network with immobile Brood tokens; Gla'aki rewards you for keeping Cultists off the map; Y'Golonac possesses enemy units when killed and passes itself around the table. Before committing to any of these, make sure every player at the table understands how the mechanic works, because misplaying a Ramsey Campbell GOO can cost you the game — and correctly playing one can warp the entire table's strategy.

**Dire GOOs are endgame plays with endgame costs — commit only when you can close.** Dire Azathoth at 10 Power and Dire Cthulhu at 6 Power with its Elder Sign chain are designed to end games, not extend them. Dire Azathoth's alternate win condition of paying 20 Power demands that the entire table respect your Power reserves from the moment the spellbook is earned, and Dire Cthulhu's Lord and Master ability generates compounding Elder Signs that accelerate your Doom track with every subsequent GOO purchase. Do not buy a Dire GOO in the mid-game hoping it will pay off eventually — buy it when you have a concrete plan to convert its effect into a win within one or two Doom Phases.
