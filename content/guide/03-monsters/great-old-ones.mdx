# Great Old Ones

## Overview

Independent Great Old Ones are a category of neutral expansion unit that any faction can purchase during the Action Phase — not during the Doom Phase like neutral monsters and terrors. To awaken most independent GOOs, you must control a Gate in the area where your own faction's Great Old One is present, then pay the listed Power cost. When you awaken one, you receive a loyalty card that ties the GOO to your faction for as long as you hold it.

Each independent GOO comes with a special ability that is active immediately upon awakening, and a spellbook that unlocks when you meet a specific condition. These spellbooks are powerful enough that earning them should be a priority. However, there is a critical risk: if an opponent kills your independent GOO in battle, you lose the loyalty card and the spellbook falls off. At that point, any player can then purchase the same GOO and claim the loyalty for themselves. Keeping your independent GOO alive is not just about preserving a combat unit — it is about protecting a potentially game-defining spellbook.

Unlike neutral monsters and terrors, which cost Doom to recruit, independent GOOs are paid for with Power. The host of the Opening the Way podcast notes this as a meaningful distinction: buying them never threatens to leave you one Doom short of winning the game.

## GOO Pack 1

*Covered in Episode 14: "Stop Faugn With My Elder Signs"*

### Abhoth — The Unclean One

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** Equal to the number of filth tokens currently in play (0 to 12)
**Filth:** 1 Power action. Place a filth token in any area. Filth tokens act as combat 0 monsters belonging to Abhoth's faction. They never move nor take actions, but they can be killed or pained normally in battle and are affected by spellbooks and abilities. There is no stated limit on stacking filth tokens in the same area.
**Spellbook requirement:** Choose one — your faction has 4 or more different monster types in play (including filth tokens), or your faction has 8 or more total monsters in play (including filth tokens).
**Spellbook — The Brood:** Ongoing. Gates in areas containing filth tokens do not count during the Doom phase. This does not apply to Abhoth's own faction.

Abhoth is broadly useful for any faction because the filth ability is essentially a way to deploy up to 12 additional 0-combat bodies anywhere on the map for just 1 Power each. Even before the spellbook comes online, stacking filth tokens around your important units makes those positions dramatically safer to defend — opponents have to battle through a pile of tokens just to reach your real units. Once you earn The Brood, the dynamic becomes threatening for the entire table: any Gate with filth in its area stops generating Doom for your opponents, forcing them to spend actions clearing tokens rather than advancing their own plans. Your own Gates are unaffected. The host strongly recommends prioritizing the spellbook quickly and notes from personal experience that if the table fails to cooperate in clearing filth, it snowballs into a serious problem very fast.

### Cthugha — The Living Flame

**Awaken cost:** Nominal cost 6. Your GOO must be present at a controlled Gate. Pay an amount equal to 6 minus your current Great Old One's awakening Power cost. If the result is negative, you gain that amount of Power instead. Your GOO is then removed and replaced by Cthugha.
**Combat:** Equal to the combat of an enemy Great Old One in the battle (your choice). If no enemy GOO is present, Cthugha's combat is 0.
**Fire Vampires:** Post-battle. If Cthugha is involved in a battle, after all kill results are assigned but before they are applied, you may choose to spare one or more enemy units by reducing their kill to a pain instead. For each unit spared this way, you gain 1 Power. Cannot be used against an enemy player with 0 Power or a hibernating Windwalker.
**Spellbook requirement:** Kill an enemy Great Old One in battle.
**Spellbook — Firestorm:** Post-battle. If Cthugha is involved in a battle, for each killed enemy unit you spare, you also gain 1 Elder Sign (in addition to the 1 Power from Fire Vampires).

Cthugha has a uniquely steep upfront cost — you must sacrifice your own awakened Great Old One to bring her in — but the Power refund mechanic softens this considerably. Factions with expensive GOOs actually benefit most: awakening a 10-cost GOO like Hastur and then swapping to Cthugha nets you 4 Power back. The Daemon Sultan interaction the host highlights is particularly elegant: awaken Thesis for 8 Power, swap for Cthugha to get a 2 Power refund, then reawaken Thesis for 0 or 1 Power — effectively getting Cthugha for free while keeping your faction GOO in play. The payoff loop through Fire Vampires and Firestorm is devastating in the right hands: fight two significant battles, spare two units each time, and you are looking at four Elder Signs, potentially 5 to 7 Doom in an action phase. Aggressive, mobile factions love this — the host calls out Windwalker, Cthulhu with Submerge, and Crawling Chaos as natural fits, with Crawling Chaos's Harbinger plus Firestorm being especially dangerous.

### Mother Hydra

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 6 minus the number of enemy units in the area (minimum 1)
**Agony Sting:** 1 Power action. Choose any ocean area. All enemy Cultists in that area must be moved to adjacent land areas by their owners. Your Cultists are immune. In a dispute over movement order, you decide.
**Spellbook requirement:** Choose one — you control no Great Old Ones in ocean areas, or enemy factions control no Great Old Ones in ocean areas.
**Spellbook — Zygote:** 1 Power action. Take all acolyte Cultists in your pool and place them on the map in any areas where you have a unit.

Mother Hydra's combat stat is a notable weakness — every enemy unit in the same area costs her a die, so she needs clean fights or substantial body support to be effective offensively. The Agony Sting ability is situational and the host acknowledges he has rarely seen it be decisive, though it can disrupt ocean-based Gate strategies when they are present. The real draw is the Zygote spellbook, which is one of the most broadly applicable effects in Pack 1. For 1 Power, you instantly fill all your areas with every Cultist currently sitting in your pool, simultaneously shoring up defenses across your entire board presence. The host flags the spellbook requirement as easy to meet if Cthulhu is not in the game, since no GOO may already be in the ocean. Cthulhu itself is actually the strongest pairing — Shogoths that absorb acolytes can be refueled every turn via Zygote for just 1 Power, creating a repeating cycle of 12-dice Shogoths. Opener of the Way gets an interesting combo as well: after spending Cultists on Favored Ones conversions, Zygote refills the pool instantly. Yellow Sign with Passion and Black Goat are also strong pairings, since both benefit from Cultists being killed or returned to the pool, letting Zygote immediately replenish what was spent. The host also notes that Zygote is simply a strong defensive panic button for any faction — if your GOO is suddenly exposed, 1 Power and three or four Cultists appear as a shield.

### Chaugnar Faugn — The Horror in the Hills

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 3
**Miuri Nigri:** Ongoing. In any battle taking place in an area with your controlled Gate, add +3 combat dice.
**Spellbook requirement:** As your action for a round, discard 2 Elder Signs. You receive no Doom for them.
**Spellbook — The Curse of Chaugnar Faugn:** Ongoing. Turn all Elder Signs in the pool face up. When any player receives an Elder Sign, you pick which one they receive. If you lose this spellbook, turn all Elder Signs face down and mix them up again.

Chaugnar Faugn is a solid defensive combat piece on his own terms: 4 Power for a unit that rolls 3 dice normally and 6 dice when defending a Gate is an efficient rate. But the spellbook is one of the most politically disruptive abilities in the entire game, and the host makes clear he has personally experienced its misery from the receiving end. Once The Curse of Chaugnar Faugn is active, the Elder Sign pool is fully visible and completely under your control — you give yourself 3s every time and hand opponents 1s unless they are offering you something in return. The host recommends treating this as public enemy number one the moment it hits the table: kill Chaugnar or prevent the spellbook from being earned at all costs. The spellbook requirement — discarding 2 Elder Signs and receiving no Doom for them — is the steepest cost in Pack 1, so try to make the discarded signs low-value ones. Factions that are already Doom-rich and ritual frequently are the biggest beneficiaries: Yellow Sign, Windwalker, and Daemon Sultan are all called out specifically, with Daemon Sultan being able to take three 3-value Elder Signs from a single ritual for six to nine Doom.

### Yig — Father of Serpents

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 2
**Snakebite:** Post-battle. Your Cultists are poisonous. If any of your Cultists are killed in battle, the enemy receives 1 extra kill result. Only 1 extra kill is dealt regardless of how many of your Cultists die.
**Spellbook requirement:** As your action for a round, remove one of your controlled Gates from the map.
**Spellbook — Messenger of Yig:** Ongoing. In the Doom phase, each other player must decide whether to donate 1 Power from their total to you. For each player who refuses, you gain 1 Doom instead.

Yig is the host's recommended entry point for introducing new players to independent GOOs — his mechanics are clean and his effects are immediately legible. The Snakebite ability is a subtle but real deterrent: any opponent calculating whether to pick a fight with Yig's Cultists has to account for eating an extra kill on top of normal combat results, making your gatekeeper Cultists meaningfully stickier than normal. The spellbook requirement to destroy one of your own Gates is a real cost (losing 3 Power worth of infrastructure), but the host notes you can use this defensively — if you stole a Gate and someone is moving back in to reclaim it, destroy the Gate before they arrive and deny them the objective while keeping your Cultist. Messenger of Yig is consistently strong in any game with three or more opponents: in a four-player game you are likely getting 2 or 3 extra Power every single Doom phase, since players will typically pay the 1 Power rather than hand you free Doom. The host frames this simply as 2 to 3 bonus Power per turn to spend on recruiting Cultists into areas where your poisonous Snakebite will do work. Doom-racing factions that want to turtle and generate passive income benefit most, but any mobile death-ball faction like Windwalker or Cthulhu also appreciates poisonous Cultists that punish opponents who try to pick off cheap units at the front of a push.

## GOO Pack 2

*Covered in Episode 16: "Weaving a Worldwide Web"*

### Atlach-Nacha — The Spinner in Darkness

**Awaken cost:** 6 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 4
**Spinnerets:** 1 Power action. If Atlach-Nacha is in an area that does not contain a web token, place one there.
**Spellbook requirement:** Web tokens are in six different areas.
**Spellbook — Cosmic Web:** 0 Power action. Immediately win the game, even if you have fewer than six faction Spellbooks.

Cosmic Web is one of only a handful of alternate win conditions in Cthulhu Wars, and it deserves to be treated as a genuine threat from the moment Atlach-Nacha hits the table. The core challenge is that placing six webs across six different areas requires both significant Power (6 Power for the webs alone, plus movement costs) and time, making the full setup expensive. In practice, the host notes that the win rarely comes from a single player completing the web uncontested — opponents will start hunting Atlach-Nacha once three or four webs are down. Critically, web tokens do not disappear when Atlach-Nacha changes hands: when a player loses the loyalty card and another buys Atlach-Nacha, the new owner inherits all previously placed webs, so killing Atlach-Nacha merely transfers the threat rather than eliminating it. The host recommends Windwalker as the best faction for this strategy, since a roaming death ball can protect Atlach-Nacha during the web-laying process and the Power surplus from hibernation covers the high action cost. Any faction with cheap or free movement similarly benefits. The host encourages players who have never tried this one to give it a go, calling it genuinely fun — especially on the Dreamlands map, where it creates a three-way race between Doom, alternate map win condition, and the web win.

### Bokrug — The Great Water Lizard

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 1
**Ghost of Ib:** Ongoing. If Bokrug is killed, you do not lose this loyalty card. Instead, place Bokrug's figure on this card. At the end of the next Doom phase, return Bokrug to any area of the map that does not contain any enemy units. If no such area exists, Bokrug remains on this card until the next Doom phase.
**Spellbook requirement:** Take this loyalty card and give it to a player of your choice. That player then places Bokrug's Spellbook on this card.
**Spellbook — The Doom That Came to Sarnath:** Doom phase ability. At the end of the Doom phase, the player holding this loyalty card selects an enemy and applies one of two effects: that enemy chooses one of your monsters or Cultists to eliminate, or that enemy chooses one of your face-down Elder Signs to discard.

Bokrug is unlike any other independent GOO — it is a poison pill designed to be passed around the table as much as wielded as a weapon. The player who first purchases Bokrug holds a 1-combat GOO that is nearly impossible to kill permanently thanks to Ghost of Ib, and can threaten to give the loyalty card (and its attached Spellbook) to whoever comes near. That threat alone has defensive value: opponents have to weigh whether attacking the Gate is worth becoming the next recipient of The Doom That Came to Sarnath. Once the Spellbook is on the card, the receiving player faces a nasty recurring drain every Doom phase — the host notes that losing a monster or Cultist is usually preferable to losing an Elder Sign, since the opponent chooses which of your face-down signs is discarded (effectively random, potentially costing 2 or 3 Doom). The way to stop the penalty is to get Bokrug killed: killing it causes the Spellbook to fall off the loyalty card, but Ghost of Ib means you do not lose the loyalty card itself — Bokrug goes onto the card and returns to the original holder at the end of the Doom phase, so there is no new owner starting fresh. The host flags this as a rattlesnake-style GOO with a lot of social dynamics at play — ideal for players who enjoy political board states.

### Father Dagon

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 2 on land; 6 in ocean areas
**Tsunami:** 1 Power action. Choose a land area adjacent to an ocean area. All Cultists in that area must be moved into adjacent ocean areas by their owners. This includes your own Cultists. In a dispute over movement order, you decide.
**Spellbook requirement:** You have 8 units in ocean areas.
**Spellbook — Innsmouth Look:** Doom phase, ongoing. During the Doom phase, remove one of your acolyte Cultists from the map permanently (out of the game). Gain 6 Power. This is not optional. If you have no acolyte Cultists on the map, there is no effect.

Father Dagon is the ocean specialist of Pack 2 — fragile on land at 2 combat but formidable in the water at 6. Tsunami mirrors Mother Hydra's Agony Sting in reverse: where Hydra pushes Cultists out of ocean areas, Dagon can pull them in. This is most effective against factions trying to turtle on a cluster of land Gates, since Tsunami can scatter their acolytes into the water and disrupt their board position. The spellbook requirement of 8 units in ocean areas is not trivial for all factions, but the host notes that if you are already using Tsunami on your own Cultists you can set up the position without excessive extra movement cost. Once Innsmouth Look comes online, the effect is powerful but has a real ceiling: every use permanently removes one of your acolytes from the game, which shrinks your Gate cap. The host advises tracking how many Cultists you have left and only using this freely when the game is near its end — ideally when the current Doom phase will fund a Ritual. Cthulhu is the natural pairing, since the faction is already in the ocean and should meet the spellbook requirement almost automatically. Any ritual-heavy faction that wants extra Power for a decisive Doom phase play also benefits, but the host cautions not to sacrifice more than two or three Cultists total unless you are confident the game will end soon.

### Ghatanothoa

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** Equal to the number of Cultists the targeted opponent has on the map
**Mummify:** 1 Power action. Any enemy acolyte Cultists sharing an area with Ghatanothoa are immediately mummified. Lay mummified Cultist figures on their sides. Mummified Cultists cannot use the move action, do not participate in battle, and produce no Power during the next Gather Power phase. During the Doom phase, stand any mummified Cultists back up. A mummified Cultist can be captured. If a Cultist controlled a Gate before being mummified, it retains control of that Gate.
**Spellbook requirement:** Either you have fewer than 6 total Gates and Cultists during the Doom phase, or as an action, pay 4 Power.
**Spellbook — Execration of Mu:** Ongoing. The Mummify ability is no longer a paid action. Instead, it occurs instantly whenever any enemy acolyte Cultists share an area with Ghatanothoa.

Ghatanothoa's variable combat stat is context-sensitive but generally strong — fighting against Cthulhu or Black Goat with many Cultists on the map means Ghatanothoa can be rolling 5 or 6 dice. Mummify is excellent for neutralizing clustered Cultist positions: factions that stack acolytes around a Gate as meat shields suddenly find all of them taken offline simultaneously for 1 Power. The spellbook requirement is flexible — the pay-4-Power option means any faction can earn it on demand without needing to be in a specific board state. Once Execration of Mu is active, the mummify effect triggers instantly at no cost whenever an enemy acolyte Cultist enters or starts in Ghatanothoa's area, completely shutting down that area for any Cultist-dependent strategy. The host notes that mobile factions like Crawling Chaos, which can range across the board and bring Ghatanothoa into contested areas, get the most value — it turns any area Ghatanothoa occupies into a no-Cultist zone that opponents have to resolve with monsters or GOOs.

## GOO Pack 4

*Covered in Episode 26: "Seeing Double"*

### Byatis — The Serpent-Bearded (God of Forgetfulness)

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 4
**Toad of Berkeley:** Ongoing. Byatis may not move, nor can he be moved with movement-type abilities such as Arctic Wind or Submerge. He can still be pained. If there are no enemy units in Byatis' area during the Doom phase, receive 1 Elder Sign.
**Spellbook requirement:** Byatis survives a battle in which at least one enemy unit is killed.
**Spellbook — God of Forgetfulness:** 1 Power action. Select all enemy Cultists in an area adjacent to Byatis. Those Cultists are moved into Byatis' area.

Byatis is a stationary 4-cost, 4-combat GOO that generates passive Elder Signs simply by being left alone. For factions that plan to hold a Gate and avoid early conflicts, that passive income is essentially free: place Byatis on a secure Gate and collect 1 Elder Sign per Doom phase for the rest of the game. The host notes that if Byatis earns even two Elder Signs before the game ends, it has paid for itself many times over in Doom value. The Toad of Berkeley's immobility is a real constraint — Byatis cannot be repositioned once placed, so Gate selection matters at awakening. The spellbook requirement runs counter to the passive Elder Sign incentive: you need someone to come fight you. At 4 combat Byatis is capable of winning those battles, and the host suggests simply letting attackers come to you and earning the spellbook opportunistically rather than chasing it. God of Forgetfulness is strong once active: dragging adjacent enemy Cultists into Byatis' area feeds his combat (he fights whoever you drag in next turn), forces opponents to spend Power moving Cultists away, and denies them safe positions adjacent to your Gate. The host calls out Crawling Chaos as a particularly good fit because Madness can pain units into adjacent areas that can then be pulled into Byatis' zone, and also recommends defensive factions like Tcho-Tcho or Opener of the Way and ritual-heavy factions like Yellow Sign that want steady Elder Sign income to fund aggressive rituals.

### Nyogtha — The Thing That Should Not Be

**Awaken cost:** 6 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One; place all Nyogtha units from the pool)
**Combat:** 4 if Nyogtha's faction declared the battle; 1 if not
**From Below:** Ongoing. Nyogtha is two units. Any common action involving one of these units can be applied simultaneously to the other as part of the same action and at no extra cost. When one Nyogtha moves, so may the other. When one captures a Cultist, so may the other. If battle is declared in one's area, you can also declare a battle in the other's area for free. You only lose this loyalty card if both Nyogtha units have been killed.
**Spellbook requirement:** Nyogtha survives a battle against an enemy Great Old One.
**Spellbook — Nightmare Web:** Ongoing. If one of the Nyogtha units is in your pool, you can awaken it for 2 Power, placing it in any area in which you have a unit.

The host names Nyogtha as one of his favorite neutral units in the entire game and says he will buy it whenever it is available. The appeal is straightforward: you are getting two 4-combat GOOs for 6 Power when you declare battles, and every action one Nyogtha takes can be simultaneously applied to the other at no extra cost. One Power moves both; one Power captures with both; one action battles in both areas. This Power efficiency is exceptional and benefits any faction, but it is especially good for factions that care about every Power saved — the host specifically calls out the ability to double-capture Cultists in a single action as a major accelerant for any doom-rushing strategy. The dual-unit rule means Nyogtha is also very hard to destroy: you keep the loyalty card until both units are killed, so losing one in a fight does not cost you the spellbook. For the spellbook requirement, the host recommends marching both Nyogtha units (8 combined dice when you declare) against an enemy GOO, ideally with one extra unit as a buffer. Once Nightmare Web is active, re-summoning a lost Nyogtha costs only 2 Power to any area where you have a unit, making the pair nearly self-sustaining. The host considers this universally strong: aggressive factions love the 8-die death ball, and defensive factions love having two GOOs to anchor two separate Gates simultaneously.

### Tulzscha

**Awaken cost:** 4 Power (your controlled Gate must be in an area with your Great Old One)
**Combat:** 1
**Undying Flame:** Gather Power phase ability. At the end of the Gather Power phase, gain 1 Doom if at least 1 faction has more Doom than you; gain 1 Elder Sign if at least 1 faction has more Elder Signs than you; gain 1 Power if at least 1 faction has more Power than you.
**Spellbook requirement:** As your action for a round, each enemy faction earns 2 Power.
**Spellbook — Ceremony of Annihilation:** Doom phase ability. When you perform a Ritual of Annihilation, you may choose to pay nothing and instead earn Power equal to the current position of the Ritual of Annihilation marker, then advance the marker by one step. You earn no extra Doom or Elder Signs from this ritual.

Tulzscha is a catch-up engine that rewards you for being behind and punishes you for running too far ahead. At 1 combat, she is not a fighter — she is a passive value generator that delivers Doom, Elder Signs, and Power based on the gap between you and the leading players. The host frames this as genuinely useful for any player who is not completely dominating: if you are trailing on Doom and Elder Signs simultaneously, a single Gather Power phase nets you 2 or even 3 resources for a 4-Power investment. If you manage to do that for multiple turns in a row, Tulzscha has paid for herself several times over. The spellbook requirement costs you nothing in terms of your own Power — giving 2 Power to each enemy is the action, and you spend zero yourself, meaning you walk in place rather than fall behind. Ceremony of Annihilation is most potent when the Ritual marker is high (6 or 7) and you have been pushed off Gates: skip paying the ritual cost entirely, pocket 6 or 7 Power, and advance the marker to make the next ritual even more expensive for opponents who still need to do it. The host notes this combo also denies opponents a ritual when you go first in the turn order, since each marker advance raises the cost for everyone. No specific faction is called out as a standout pairing — the host considers Tulzscha broadly useful to any faction that is not already crushing, which covers most board states for most of a game.

## General Tips for Independent GOOs

**Buy with Power, not Doom.** Unlike neutral monsters and terrors, independent GOOs are purchased with Power during the Action Phase. This means they never compete with Doom-spending and never put you one point short of winning. You can add one to your plans without the cost-of-entry penalty that comes with Doom-based neutrals.

**Timing matters more than the unit.** The right turn to awaken a GOO is when your Power budget has slack and your Great Old One is already in a well-defended position at a controlled Gate. Awakening on a shoestring means you cannot respond to the board state afterward. The host generally recommends not committing to a GOO purchase unless you can still afford at least one or two meaningful follow-up actions in the same phase.

**Your spellbook lives or dies with your GOO.** If an opponent kills your independent GOO, you lose the loyalty card and the spellbook falls off. At that point, anyone can purchase the GOO and claim the loyalty themselves. Protecting your independent GOO is not optional once the spellbook is active — position it with other units, keep it in areas where combat will be costly for attackers, and avoid stretching it out as a solo forward scout.

**The table adapts to alternate win conditions.** Atlach-Nacha and Cosmic Web in particular change the entire threat landscape of the game: once three or four webs are down, all opponents will begin prioritizing Atlach-Nacha's destruction. Plan for the web strategy to draw heat, and have a fallback plan if the alternate win fails. The risk-reward calculus favors patience: lay webs opportunistically rather than telegraphing the win several turns in advance.

**High-cost GOOs need a clear plan.** Nyogtha at 6 Power and Atlach-Nacha at 6 Power are significant investments relative to a normal game Power budget. Before committing, identify what specific advantage the GOO unlocks for your faction that your current units do not provide. Awakening a 6-cost GOO in a tight Power turn and then not using its abilities for two or three phases means the purchase has been largely wasted. The host consistently returns to the idea that independent GOOs need to be working for you from the moment they hit the board.
