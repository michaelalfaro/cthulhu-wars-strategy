# Terrors

## Overview

Cosmic Terrors are purchased during the **Doom Phase** by paying **2 Doom + 2 Power** to acquire their loyalty card, which immediately places the Terror at one of your controlled Gates. This cost structure differs from standard neutral monsters: regular neutrals spend 2 Doom once for the loyalty card and then pay only Power per monster in subsequent Doom Phases, whereas each Terror costs 2 Doom and 2 Power every time — there is no cheaper re-summon option.

The defining mechanical property that separates Terrors from ordinary monsters is their **immunity to Spellbook abilities that target monsters specifically**. A Terror cannot be Devoured by Great Cthulhu's Devour Spellbook, cannot be made invisible by Flying Polyps, and is similarly unaffected by any other Spellbook whose text specifies monsters as the target. In all other respects — movement, combat, area control — Terrors behave exactly like monsters. This immunity makes Terrors meaningfully harder to remove than regular monsters and changes how opponents must assess and respond to them.

Because of the 2 Doom cost, every Terror purchase must be evaluated carefully. Two Doom is a meaningful sacrifice at any point in the game, and in a close race it can be the margin between winning and losing a Ritual. The host's general standard is that a Terror should reasonably pay for itself — recovering at least 2 Doom worth of value over the course of the game — before it is considered worth purchasing.

This page covers the three Cosmic Terrors from the Cosmic Terrors expansion, as well as additional Terrors introduced in other expansions such as Masks of Nyarlathotep and Something About Cats.

## Cosmic Terrors

*Covered in Episode 22: "Out of Body Experience"*

### Great Race of Yith

**Cost:** 2 Doom + 2 Power (Doom Phase)
**Combat:** 3
**Possession:** Ongoing. During the Gather Power phase, the Great Race of Yith may capture an enemy Cultist regardless of any other units present in that area, including Great Old Ones. This ability also bypasses Ferox (the Windwalker Spellbook that normally prevents capture of Cultists).

The host considers the Great Race of Yith the strongest of the three Terrors and gives it a strong recommendation for virtually every faction. The key feature is the unconditional capture — normally, players protect their Cultists by keeping a Great Old One present, since a Cultist cannot be captured if an enemy GOO is in the area. The Great Race ignores this entirely. Every Cultist it captures during Gather Power also generates the standard 2 Power bonus for the capturing player, meaning two captures alone yields 4 Power — enough to fund most of an additional action or a significant chunk of a Ritual. The host notes this is a unit that can pay for itself indirectly: even without killing anything, consistent capturing of Cultists strips Gates away from opponents while simultaneously generating Power for the owner. The main challenge is positioning — you need to move the Great Race into range of enemy Cultists safely before it can do its work, which makes it a stronger pick for mobile factions like Crawling Chaos or death-ball style factions that can project force across the map. Turtling factions that stay in one place get less mileage from the capture ability, but even they benefit from a 3-combat, Spellbook-immune unit.

### Dhole

**Cost:** 2 Doom + 2 Power (Doom Phase)
**Combat:** 5
**Planetary Destruction:** Post-battle. If the Dhole is killed or eliminated in battle, earn 2 Elder Signs. Additionally, the opponent who killed the Dhole gains your choice of 2 Doom or 2 Power.

The Dhole is the largest raw combat unit among the three Terrors, and its Planetary Destruction ability means it can literally pay for itself in Elder Signs the first time it dies. Two Elder Signs is a minimum of 2 Doom worth of progress; if the Dhole dies twice over the course of a game you are ahead of the entry cost in Doom terms. The reward — 2 Doom or 2 Power — is your choice as the Dhole's owner, not the opponent's, which is a meaningful lever. When the opponent is closing in on 20 Doom and has Elder Signs already, you give them 2 Power instead of accelerating their win condition; when they are low on Doom but about to spend their Power reserves fighting you further, giving them 2 Power might fuel another attack, so 2 Doom becomes the lesser evil. The host recommends buying the Dhole as a purchase you will not regret — it contributes 5 combat dice on offense or defense and rewards the opponent for killing it in a way you control. Mobile, death-ball factions (Crawling Chaos, Windwalker, Great Cthulhu) can throw the Dhole into fights repeatedly, racking up Elder Signs across multiple encounters. Even defensive factions that park the Dhole at a fortified Gate benefit: a 5-combat unit sitting behind a defended position is a meaningful deterrent, and if the attacker chews through it anyway, you earn 2 Elder Signs for the privilege. The host recounted seeing the Dhole generate six Elder Signs in a single game, which he considered quite good.

### Quachil Uttaus (Treader of Dust)

**Cost:** 2 Doom + 2 Power (Doom Phase)
**Combat:** 1
**Dust to Dust:** Post-battle. If an enemy unit is killed or eliminated in a battle involving Quachil Uttaus, that unit's owner must choose one of the following: select one of their units to be permanently removed from the game, or the Quachil Uttaus's owner gains 1 Elder Sign.

Quachil Uttaus presents an uncomfortable dilemma to any opponent forced to fight it: every kill in a battle that includes Quachil Uttaus triggers Dust to Dust, meaning the opponent must either permanently lose a unit of their choosing (removing it from the game entirely, not just killing it) or give up an Elder Sign. Neither option is good. Permanently removing a unit strips the opponent's future Gate capacity; giving up an Elder Sign hands you Doom progress at a rate that can pay for the entry cost in just one or two battle triggers. The critical caveat is that Quachil Uttaus itself rolls only 1 combat die — on its own, it is unlikely to generate any kills, so it absolutely requires dice support from allied units to trigger Dust to Dust. The host's advice is to take Quachil Uttaus into fights proactively rather than leave it on defense, so you can control the composition of the battle and ensure you have enough allied dice rolling alongside it to produce kills. Great Cthulhu Submerging in with a full stack is the host's go-to example — the opponent is almost certainly going to watch at least one of their units die, then face the grim choice between permanently losing a monster and surrendering an Elder Sign. Mobile, combat-capable factions extract the most value; passive or low-combat factions will struggle to trigger the ability consistently enough to justify the 2 Doom purchase.

## Tips & Synergies

**Evaluate every Terror against the 2 Doom threshold.** Unlike neutral monsters where the Doom cost is a one-time loyalty card entry and subsequent monsters cost only Power, each Terror demands 2 Doom and 2 Power on purchase. That 2 Doom is a real cost — it can mean the difference between winning a close Ritual race and losing one. Before buying, ask whether this Terror is realistically going to recover 2 Doom worth of value in the number of Doom Phases remaining. If the game is winding down quickly, Terrors become less attractive.

**Buy the Great Race of Yith early and position it aggressively.** The Possession ability generates Power through Cultist captures every Gather Power phase, which means the earlier you put it into a profitable position, the more times it can trigger before the game ends. Each pair of captures is 4 Power — a return that compounds quickly if the Great Race survives multiple Doom Phases. Pair it with a mobile strategy that can escort or protect the unit while it hunts Cultists.

**The Dhole's death trigger is a feature, not a bug — buy it early so it can die more than once.** Because Planetary Destruction fires every time the Dhole is killed, buying the Dhole early means it has more opportunities to die and be re-purchased. Six Elder Signs in a game — the host's real-world example — represents 6 Doom of progress from a unit that started at a 2 Doom entry cost. The opponent's resource gift (2 Doom or 2 Power) is always your choice, so you retain control over the worst outcome.

**Quachil Uttaus needs combat support — never send it into a fight alone.** With only 1 combat die, Quachil Uttaus will rarely generate kills by itself. Its entire value depends on allied units rolling kills alongside it, so bring it into battles where your faction already has strong dice. Death-ball factions and mobile GOO-heavy factions are the best carriers. Do not use Quachil Uttaus as a passive Gate defender unless you have a powerful allied stack already there.

**The Spellbook immunity changes your threat calculus when positioning Terrors.** Regular monsters can be removed by Devour, Flying Polyps, and similar targeted Spellbook effects, which gives opponents an easy answer. Terrors cannot be removed this way, which means opponents must spend Power on actual combat to eliminate them. This raises the real cost of contesting a Terror-defended area and can create positional leverage that outlasts what a comparable regular monster would provide.

## Additional Terrors

*The following Terrors appear in expansions beyond the core Cosmic Terrors pack. They share the standard Terror immunity to Spellbook abilities that target monsters, but their cost structures differ from the original three Cosmic Terrors — check each unit's cost line for specifics.*

### The Shadow Pharaoh

**Cost:** 4 Power (2 Power for Crawling Chaos)
**Combat:** 2
**Hebephrenia:** Ongoing. Gates cannot be controlled in The Shadow Pharaoh's area. Any units occupying Gates in the area immediately abandon control of those Gates.

The Shadow Pharaoh is a Gate-denial weapon from the Masks of Nyarlathotep expansion that creates a dead zone wherever it is positioned. Hebephrenia does not destroy Gates — it simply makes them uncontrollable, meaning any faction with a Gate in The Shadow Pharaoh's area loses the Power income, Doom generation, and strategic anchor that Gate normally provides. This is one of the most directly disruptive positional abilities in the game: moving The Shadow Pharaoh into an opponent's key Gate cluster can strip multiple Gates from their control in a single action, collapsing their Power economy and Ritual capacity simultaneously. At 4 Power for most factions and a discounted 2 Power for Crawling Chaos, the cost is reasonable relative to the devastation it can cause. Crawling Chaos is the natural home for this unit — the reduced cost makes it accessible early, and the faction's mobility allows it to reposition The Shadow Pharaoh to wherever it will cause the most damage. At 2 combat The Shadow Pharaoh is not a serious combat threat on its own, so it requires escort units to survive retaliation from opponents whose Gates it is disrupting. The optimal play is to use The Shadow Pharaoh as a surgical strike tool: move it into a critical junction where two or three opponent Gates overlap, shut down all of them simultaneously, and force the table to deal with the positional crisis while you advance your own Doom track. The Spellbook immunity shared by all Terrors makes it meaningfully harder to remove than a normal monster — opponents must commit to actual battle rather than using targeted removal effects.

### Cat from Neptune

**Cost:** 1 Power
**Combat:** 3
**The Final Ritual:** If the Cat from Neptune is killed in Battle, you may immediately perform a Ritual of Annihilation (paying the normal cost).

The Cat from Neptune from the Something About Cats expansion is deceptively simple: a 1-Power, 3-combat unit whose death trigger allows you to immediately perform a Ritual of Annihilation outside of the normal Doom Phase timing. This is an extraordinarily powerful effect hidden behind an unassuming stat line. In normal play, Rituals can only be performed during the Doom Phase, which means opponents have the entire Action Phase to disrupt your position, kill your Cultists, and reduce your Gate count before you can Ritual. The Final Ritual bypasses this entirely — if the Cat from Neptune dies in battle during the Action Phase, you can Ritual on the spot, locking in your current Doom and Elder Sign earnings before opponents have a chance to respond. The strategic implications are significant: you can deliberately send the Cat from Neptune into a fight you expect to lose, let it die, and immediately Ritual with your full Gate count intact. At only 1 Power, you can recruit it repeatedly without meaningful economic drain, and at 3 combat it contributes real dice to battles even when you are not planning to sacrifice it. The key constraint is paying the Ritual cost — you need enough Power reserved to cover the current Ritual of Annihilation marker position at the moment the Cat dies, so Power management is critical. Factions that generate surplus Power and plan to Ritual aggressively — such as any faction running Tulzscha or factions with strong Power economies — get the most from this unit. The ability to threaten an out-of-phase Ritual fundamentally changes how opponents must evaluate every battle the Cat participates in.
