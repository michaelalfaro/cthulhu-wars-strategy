# Terrors

## Overview

Cosmic Terrors are purchased during the **Doom Phase** by paying **2 Doom + 2 Power** to acquire their loyalty card, which immediately places the Terror at one of your controlled Gates. This cost structure differs from standard neutral monsters: regular neutrals spend 2 Doom once for the loyalty card and then pay only Power per monster in subsequent Doom Phases, whereas each Terror costs 2 Doom and 2 Power every time — there is no cheaper re-summon option.

The defining mechanical property that separates Terrors from ordinary monsters is their **immunity to Spellbook abilities that target monsters specifically**. A Terror cannot be Devoured by Great Cthulhu's Devour Spellbook, cannot be made invisible by Flying Polyps, and is similarly unaffected by any other Spellbook whose text specifies monsters as the target. In all other respects — movement, combat, area control — Terrors behave exactly like monsters. This immunity makes Terrors meaningfully harder to remove than regular monsters and changes how opponents must assess and respond to them.

Because of the 2 Doom cost, every Terror purchase must be evaluated carefully. Two Doom is a meaningful sacrifice at any point in the game, and in a close race it can be the margin between winning and losing a Ritual. The host's general standard is that a Terror should reasonably pay for itself — recovering at least 2 Doom worth of value over the course of the game — before it is considered worth purchasing.

This page covers the three Cosmic Terrors from the Cosmic Terrors expansion.

## Cosmic Terrors

*Covered in Episode 22: "Out of Body Experience"*

### Great Race of Yith

**Cost:** 2 Doom + 2 Power (Doom Phase)
**Combat:** 3
**Possession:** Ongoing. During the Gather Power phase, the Great Race of Yith may capture an enemy Cultist regardless of any other units present in that area, including Great Old Ones. This ability also bypasses Ferox (the Windwalker Spellbook that normally prevents capture of Cultists).

The host considers the Great Race of Yith the strongest of the three Terrors and gives it a strong recommendation for virtually every faction. The key feature is the unconditional capture — normally, players protect their Cultists by keeping a Great Old One present, since a Cultist cannot be captured if an enemy GOO is in the area. The Great Race ignores this entirely. Every Cultist it captures during Gather Power also generates the standard 2 Power bonus for the capturing player, meaning two captures alone yields 4 Power — enough to fund most of an additional action or a significant chunk of a Ritual. The host notes this is a unit that can pay for itself indirectly: even without killing anything, consistent capturing of Cultists strips Gates away from opponents while simultaneously generating Power for the owner. The main challenge is positioning — you need to move the Great Race into range of enemy Cultists safely before it can do its work, which makes it a stronger pick for mobile factions like Crawling Chaos or death-ball style factions that can project force across the map. Turtling factions that stay in one place get less mileage from the capture ability, but even they benefit from a 3-combat, Spellbook-immune unit.

### Dhole

**Cost:** 2 Doom + 2 Power (Doom Phase)
**Combat:** 5
**Planetary Destruction:** Post-battle. If the Dhole is killed or eliminated in battle, earn 2 Elder Signs. Additionally, the opponent who killed the Dhole gains your choice of 2 Doom or 2 Power.

The Dhole is the largest raw combat unit among the three Terrors, and its Planetary Destruction ability means it can literally pay for itself in Elder Signs the first time it dies. Two Elder Signs is a minimum of 2 Doom worth of progress; if the Dhole dies twice over the course of a game you are ahead of the entry cost in Doom terms. The opponent's choice — 2 Doom or 2 Power — is always yours to make as the Dhole's owner, which is a meaningful lever. When the opponent is closing in on 20 Doom and has Elder Signs already, you give them 2 Power instead of accelerating their win condition; when they are low on Doom but about to spend their Power reserves fighting you further, giving them 2 Power might fuel another attack, so 2 Doom becomes the lesser evil. The host recommends buying the Dhole as a purchase you will not regret — it contributes 5 combat dice on offense or defense and rewards the opponent for killing it in a way you control. Mobile, death-ball factions (Crawling Chaos, Windwalker, Great Cthulhu) can throw the Dhole into fights repeatedly, racking up Elder Signs across multiple encounters. Even defensive factions that park the Dhole at a fortified Gate benefit: a 5-combat unit sitting behind a defended position is a meaningful deterrent, and if the attacker chews through it anyway, you earn 2 Elder Signs for the privilege. The host recounted seeing the Dhole generate six Elder Signs in a single game, which he considered quite good.

### Qwakil Utaus (Treader of Dust)

**Cost:** 2 Doom + 2 Power (Doom Phase)
**Combat:** 1
**Dust to Dust:** Post-battle. If an enemy unit is killed or eliminated in a battle involving Qwakil Utaus, that unit's owner must choose one of the following: select one of their units to be permanently removed from the game, or the Qwakil Utaus's owner gains 1 Elder Sign.

Qwakil Utaus presents an uncomfortable dilemma to any opponent forced to fight it: every kill in a battle that includes Qwakil Utaus triggers Dust to Dust, meaning the opponent must either permanently lose a unit of their choosing (removing it from the game entirely, not just killing it) or give up an Elder Sign. Neither option is good. Permanently removing a unit strips the opponent's future Gate capacity; giving up an Elder Sign hands you Doom progress at a rate that can pay for the entry cost in just one or two battle triggers. The critical caveat is that Qwakil Utaus itself rolls only 1 combat die — on its own, it is unlikely to generate any kills, so it absolutely requires dice support from allied units to trigger Dust to Dust. The host's advice is to take Qwakil Utaus into fights proactively rather than leave it on defense, so you can control the composition of the battle and ensure you have enough allied dice rolling alongside it to produce kills. Great Cthulhu Submerging in with a full stack is the host's go-to example — the opponent is almost certainly going to watch at least one of their units die, then face the grim choice between permanently losing a monster and surrendering an Elder Sign. Mobile, combat-capable factions extract the most value; passive or low-combat factions will struggle to trigger the ability consistently enough to justify the 2 Doom purchase.

## Tips & Synergies

**Evaluate every Terror against the 2 Doom threshold.** Unlike neutral monsters where the Doom cost is a one-time loyalty card entry and subsequent monsters cost only Power, each Terror demands 2 Doom and 2 Power on purchase. That 2 Doom is a real cost — it can mean the difference between winning a close Ritual race and losing one. Before buying, ask whether this Terror is realistically going to recover 2 Doom worth of value in the number of Doom Phases remaining. If the game is winding down quickly, Terrors become less attractive.

**Buy the Great Race of Yith early and position it aggressively.** The Possession ability generates Power through Cultist captures every Gather Power phase, which means the earlier you put it into a profitable position, the more times it can trigger before the game ends. Each pair of captures is 4 Power — a return that compounds quickly if the Great Race survives multiple Doom Phases. Pair it with a mobile strategy that can escort or protect the unit while it hunts Cultists.

**The Dhole's death trigger is a feature, not a bug — buy it early so it can die more than once.** Because Planetary Destruction fires every time the Dhole is killed, buying the Dhole early means it has more opportunities to die and be re-purchased. Six Elder Signs in a game — the host's real-world example — represents 6 Doom of progress from a unit that started at a 2 Doom entry cost. The opponent's resource gift (2 Doom or 2 Power) is always your choice, so you retain control over the worst outcome.

**Qwakil Utaus needs combat support — never send it into a fight alone.** With only 1 combat die, Qwakil Utaus will rarely generate kills by itself. Its entire value depends on allied units rolling kills alongside it, so bring it into battles where your faction already has strong dice. Death-ball factions and mobile GOO-heavy factions are the best carriers. Do not use Qwakil Utaus as a passive Gate defender unless you have a powerful allied stack already there.

**The Spellbook immunity changes your threat calculus when positioning Terrors.** Regular monsters can be removed by Devour, Flying Polyps, and similar targeted Spellbook effects, which gives opponents an easy answer. Terrors cannot be removed this way, which means opponents must spend Power on actual combat to eliminate them. This raises the real cost of contesting a Terror-defended area and can create positional leverage that outlasts what a comparable regular monster would provide.
