# The Ancients

## Overview

The Ancients are one of the strangest factions in Cthulhu Wars. They break a fundamental assumption of the game: they have no Great Old Ones. None. Zero. In a game where Great Old Ones define faction identity and protect your gates, the Ancients instead rely on Cathedrals -- unique buildings that fuel social engineering, Elder Sign generation, and the terrifying ability to snipe enemy Great Old Ones right off the map. Drawing from Lovecraft and Hazel Heald's "The Mound," this faction represents the subterranean civilization that mastered genetic manipulation and synthetic life creation. Their units are cheap, their combat dice are absurd, and their Dematerialization ability lets them teleport a strike force anywhere on the map during every Doom Phase. If you enjoy table talk, deal-making, and punching people in the face with dinosaur-dogs rolling 21 combat dice, the Ancients are for you.

**Difficulty:** Intermediate to advanced. Requires strong table talk skills and an understanding of when to cooperate versus when to bully.

**Playstyle in a sentence:** You are the scrappy brawler with no Great Old One who compensates with cheap units, devastating combat potential, and the social cunning to turn opponents against each other while your Cathedrals fuel your doom engine.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

The Ancients play unlike anything else in Cthulhu Wars. Without a Great Old One, nothing inherently prevents opponents from capturing your Cultists. You lack the built-in gate protection that every other faction takes for granted. So how do you survive? Two words: social engineering and violence.

**Core Strengths:**

- No Great Old One means no expensive "turn off" to awaken. All your units are cheap, and you are always doing something productive.
- Dematerialization is one of the top 3-5 faction abilities in the entire game. Free teleportation of any or all units from one area to another, anywhere on the map, every Doom Phase.
- Yothans are Terrors with 7 combat dice each for only 3 Power (with Extinction). Three Yothans together roll 21 dice. Add Reanimated and you are looking at 27 dice -- competing with the highest totals any faction can achieve.
- Cathedrals provide extra Power via Worship Services, bonus Elder Signs via Consecration, and the ability to eliminate enemy Great Old Ones via Unholy Ground.
- Spellbook tempo is among the fastest in the game, rivaled perhaps only by Tcho-Tcho. You can have all six spellbooks and Unlimited Combat before most factions have four.
- Festival Unmen give you repeatable zero-cost actions for stalling while feeding Power to an ally.
- Terrors (Yothans) are immune to abilities that target Monsters -- Cthulhu cannot Devour them, Invisibility does not work on them.

**Core Weaknesses:**

- No Great Old One means no inherent Cultist protection at gates. You must fight or negotiate to keep your gates safe.
- Power can be tight. Losing Cultists to capture is devastating because every point of Power matters.
- Extinction permanently removes killed Yothans from the game. Losing them carelessly wastes your most precious combat resource.
- Brainless Reanimated cannot move, capture, or declare battle without a non-Reanimated buddy unit present.
- Your social engineering only works if other players cooperate. Against experienced opponents who refuse your deals, your toolkit shrinks.
- You depend on Cathedrals for Elder Signs, Power generation, and Unholy Ground. If opponents prevent you from building them, you stall.

## Spellbook Abilities

### Worship Services
**Unlock condition:** Build a Cathedral in an area with one of the four glyph types (or no glyph). Each Cathedral built in a qualifying area earns a spellbook.
**Effect:** During the Gather Power phase, gain 1 Power for each Cathedral that shares an area with an enemy gate. Those enemies each gain 1 Power as well.
**Strategic notes:** This is your social engineering engine. Players love free Power, and you can leverage that desire to build Cathedrals on their gates with their blessing. If you have three or four Cathedrals on enemy gates, you are generating 3-4 extra Power per turn -- enough to subsidize a ritual every single round. The catch is that experienced opponents know a Cathedral in their area is not purely a gift. It is also a loaded gun called Unholy Ground. Use Worship Services early to build goodwill and fund your rituals, but be prepared for savvy players to push back once they understand the threat.

### Consecration
**Unlock condition:** Build a Cathedral in an area with one of the four glyph types (or no glyph). Each Cathedral built earns a spellbook.
**Effect:** In the Doom Phase, when you perform a Ritual of Annihilation, gain 1 Elder Sign if at least one Cathedral is in play. If all four Cathedrals are in play, gain 2 Elder Signs instead.
**Strategic notes:** This is how the Ancients generate Elder Signs without a Great Old One. Do not wait for all four Cathedrals before ritualing -- one to three Cathedrals still nets you one Elder Sign, which is not nothing. Two gates plus one Cathedral with Consecration and a ritual gives you a minimum of five doom (two from gates, two from ritual, one from Consecration). That is a solid doom engine. Push for all four Cathedrals when you can, though, because two Elder Signs per ritual is extremely strong and can close the gap against factions with Great Old One Elder Sign generation.

### Unholy Ground
**Unlock condition:** Build a Cathedral in an area with one of the four glyph types (or no glyph). Each Cathedral built earns a spellbook.
**Effect:** Post-battle ability. If there is a Cathedral in the battle area, you may choose to remove a Cathedral from anywhere on the map (not just the battle area). If you do, an enemy Great Old One in the battle must be eliminated by its owner.
**Strategic notes:** This is one of the most important tools in the Ancients' arsenal and arguably the scariest post-battle ability in the game. You do not need to win the battle or even roll a single hit. You just need a battle to occur in an area with a Cathedral, and you can auto-kill a Great Old One. The key detail is that the Cathedral you sacrifice can be from anywhere on the map -- not just the battle area. This means you can build a Cathedral on an ally's gate via Worship Services, then sacrifice it from across the map when you fight a different opponent. A 10-cost Great Old One like Nyarlathotep should be terrified of Unholy Ground. Even a single Reanimated with a Cathedral nearby is a lethal threat. Combined with Dematerialization, you can teleport into an opponent's area during the Doom Phase, and if they foolishly awaken their Great Old One there, you build a Cathedral and snipe it. After Unlimited Combat, the devastating combo is: build a Cathedral as your normal action, then immediately declare Unlimited Combat to eliminate their Great Old One. Opponents cannot react in time.

### Festival
**Unlock condition:** Build a Cathedral in an area with one of the four glyph types (or no glyph), OR use the "each player summons their lowest/highest cost monster" spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** Ongoing. Unmen now cost 0 Power to summon. When you summon an Unmen, you must also select an enemy player to gain 1 Power. This is not optional.
**Strategic notes:** Festival turns Unmen into the ultimate stalling tool. Zero-cost actions are gold in Cthulhu Wars -- you can keep taking turns when everyone else is passing. The mandatory Power gift to an opponent is not a drawback; it is a feature. Find a cooperative player, feed them Power in exchange for favors -- do not attack my gates, go fight that other player, vote for this turn order. If your Unmen die in battle (which they will, since they have zero combat), you just resummon them for free and funnel more Power to your puppet. Do not give away Festival Power randomly. Pick a partner and work them throughout the game for maximum value.

### Brainless
**Unlock condition:** Build a Cathedral in an area with one of the four glyph types (or no glyph), OR use the "each player summons their lowest/highest cost monster" spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** Ongoing. Reanimated now cost only 1 Power to summon. They may only move, capture, or declare battle if they share an area with one or more of your non-Reanimated units. This is not optional.
**Strategic notes:** One Power for two combat dice is an excellent rate. The movement restriction sounds harsh, but Dematerialization completely bypasses it -- you teleport your whole group, Reanimated included, to wherever they need to be. The buddy system is mandatory: never leave a Reanimated alone, or it becomes dead weight. Pair them with a Cultist to build Cathedrals and then fight, or roll them into your Yothan death ball for extra dice. Three Reanimated add six combat dice to your force for only three Power total. Combined with Yothans, that is 27 dice, which overwhelms nearly anything in the game.

### Extinction
**Unlock condition:** Build a Cathedral in an area with one of the four glyph types (or no glyph), OR use the "each player summons their lowest/highest cost monster" spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** Ongoing. Yothans now cost only 3 Power to summon. When a Yothan is killed or eliminated, remove it from the game permanently. This is not optional.
**Strategic notes:** Three Power for seven combat dice is the best Power-to-dice ratio in Cthulhu Wars. Take Extinction -- do not be tempted to keep Yothans at 6 cost just so you can resummon them. The Power you save by summoning at 3 instead of 6 is better spent on moving, battling, and building Cathedrals. Yothans are a finite resource: you get three, and once they die, they are gone forever. But that is the point. They are meant to be used, not hoarded. If you end the game with all three Yothans still alive, you probably did not fight hard enough. A Yothan that trades itself for an enemy Great Old One via Unholy Ground is a spectacular deal. Just protect them with an entourage of Unmen and Reanimated early on so you control when and how they go down.

## Units

### Cultists (Acolytes)
- **Cost:** 1 Power to recruit
- **Combat dice:** 0
- **Available:** 6
- **Role:** Gate controllers, Cathedral builders, Dematerialization passengers. The Ancients' Acolytes look like innocent little pilots holding something aloft, as if to say "look what I found!" They are not innocent. They build Cathedrals, earn spellbooks, and provide the non-Reanimated buddy that your Brainless units need to function. No spellbooks directly enhance them, but Dematerialization lets you teleport them into position for free during the Doom Phase. Protect your Cultists fiercely -- losing one to capture costs you Power income and potentially a gate, and Power is tight with this faction.

### Unmen
- **Cost:** 3 Power (0 with Festival)
- **Combat dice:** 0
- **Available:** 3
- **Role:** Zero-cost stalling actions, social engineering fuel, Brainless buddy units, expendable battle companions. Unmen look like they were human a few generations ago but have been twisted by genetic experimentation into something spindly and wrong. Despite having zero combat dice, they are essential. With Festival, they cost nothing to summon and let you feed Power to a cooperative player while taking free actions. They serve as the buddy unit for Reanimated under Brainless. In combat, they absorb kills that would otherwise hit your Yothans. Get them killed deliberately so you can resummon them for free and keep funneling Power to your ally.

### Reanimated
- **Cost:** 4 Power (1 with Brainless)
- **Combat dice:** 2
- **Available:** 3
- **Role:** Cost-efficient combat muscle, Yothan escorts, Cathedral assault companions. Reanimated look like former humans augmented with Borg-like machinery -- oxygen tubes, mechanical arm attachments, deeply disturbing. At one Power for two combat dice (with Brainless), they are an excellent value. Three Reanimated add six dice to your force for only three Power total. The catch: they cannot move, capture, or declare battle without a non-Reanimated unit present. Always pair them with a Cultist or Unmen. Dematerialization handles their movement restriction beautifully -- teleport the whole group during the Doom Phase. A Reanimated plus a Cultist dematerialized onto an enemy gate is a classic Ancients play: build a Cathedral, then threaten Unholy Ground.

### Yothan (Terror)
- **Cost:** 6 Power (3 with Extinction)
- **Combat dice:** 7
- **Available:** 3
- **Role:** Primary combat powerhouse, Great Old One killer, the faction's crown jewel. Yothans look like ferocious dinosaur-dogs -- chonky, crouched, and ready to pounce. They are not Monsters; they are Terrors, which means abilities that affect Monsters (Invisibility, Devour, etc.) do not work on them. Seven combat dice for three Power is an insane rate. Two Yothans roll 14 dice. Three roll 21. Add Reanimated and you hit 27 dice -- territory that only Great Cthulhu's Absorb ball and Windwalker at full strength can match. However, Extinction means killed Yothans are permanently removed from the game. They are a finite resource. Protect them with an entourage of cheaper units and choose your battles wisely. Trading a Yothan to eliminate an enemy Great Old One via Unholy Ground is almost always worth it. Do not leave Yothans alone -- surround them with Unmen or Reanimated to absorb kills first.

## Cathedrals (Special Buildings)

- **Cost:** 3 Power to construct if adjacent to another Cathedral; 1 Power if not adjacent to another Cathedral
- **Available:** 4
- **How to build:** Use the Create Gate action. As the Ancients, you may construct either a gate or a Cathedral (requires a Cultist in the area). Cathedrals can coexist with gates in the same area.
- **Placement restriction:** When building in a Gated area, only one Cathedral may be placed in an area containing each glyph type (claw/scratching, chevron, ouroboros, or no glyph). This restriction only applies to Gated areas and is easy to miss.
- **Ownership:** Unlike gates, Cathedrals always belong to you even if you have no units in the area. They are not units and cannot participate in battles.
- **Special rule:** If all four Cathedrals are in play, you may awaken an independent Great Old One without having your own Great Old One. Awakening Cthugha specifically costs only 6 Power.
- **Role:** Cathedrals are your substitute for Great Old Ones. They earn you spellbooks, generate Power (Worship Services), produce Elder Signs (Consecration), and kill Great Old Ones (Unholy Ground). Ideally, build them non-adjacent to each other (1 Power each instead of 3). Use Dematerialization to move Cultists into position for free during the Doom Phase, then build the Cathedral in the Action Phase for just 1 Power.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

**Setup:** The Ancients set up after all factions except Tcho-Tcho, Windwalker, and Opener of the Way. You start with 8 Power, 6 Acolytes, and a controlled gate in any area containing no game symbol. You can place in areas with Yellow Sign glyphs (scratching, chevron, ouroboros). Choose your starting position based on whether you plan to play cooperatively (near potential allies) or aggressively (near targets you want to bully).

### Turn 1 (Action Phase 1) -- 8 Power

**Ritual Engine Opening (recommended for beginners):**
1. Move an Acolyte to an adjacent area (1 Power). Remaining: 7.
2. Build a gate in that area (3 Power). Remaining: 4.
3. Build a Cathedral on or near your starting gate area (1 Power if not adjacent to another Cathedral). Remaining: 3.
4. Take Consecration as your spellbook.
5. Use remaining Power to summon a unit or take a free spellbook (give away cheapest monsters to all players for free -- earns a spellbook at zero cost).

This sets you up to ritual in the first Doom Phase and start accumulating Elder Signs immediately.

**Yothan Bomb Opening (aggressive):**
1. Skip building a second gate entirely.
2. Take Extinction early as your spellbook.
3. Summon two Yothans at your starting gate (6 Power). Remaining: 2.
4. Use your free spellbook requirements (cheapest/most expensive monster giveaway) for additional books.
5. During the first Doom Phase, Dematerialize both Yothans into an opponent's area.

This is the most aggressive possible opening. If an opponent awakens a Great Old One in the area where your Yothans just teleported, and you have Unholy Ground plus a Cathedral, that Great Old One is dead. Very punishing against players unfamiliar with the Ancients.

**Balanced Opening (flexible):**
1. Move and build a second gate (4 Power). Remaining: 4.
2. Take Brainless and summon all three Reanimated (3 Power), OR take Extinction and summon one Yothan (3 Power). Remaining: 1.
3. Take one of the free spellbook requirements for a third book.

### Turn 2 (Action Phase 2) -- Typically 10-12 Power

**Primary goals:**
- Build 1-2 more Cathedrals to earn additional spellbooks (1 Power each if placed non-adjacent).
- If you went Yothan Bomb, Dematerialization should have already positioned you near an opponent. Build a Cathedral and threaten Unholy Ground.
- Start leveraging free spellbook requirements (cheapest/most expensive monster giveaway) if you have not already. These cost you nothing and can be timed strategically -- give away cheapest monsters before opponents have already summoned theirs; give away most expensive monsters after some opponents already have theirs out.
- Push toward Unlimited Combat. Your spellbook tempo is fast enough to have all six by this point.

### Turn 3 (Action Phase 3) -- 10-14 Power

**Goals:**
- You should have all six spellbooks and Unlimited Combat by now (or very close). Most factions cannot match this tempo.
- Once you have Unlimited Combat, the devastating combo opens up: build a Cathedral as your normal action, then immediately declare Unlimited Combat in that area. Enemy Great Old Ones cannot escape.
- Begin ritualing every turn with at least two gates and Consecration for minimum five doom per Doom Phase.
- Start assembling your death ball of Yothans + Reanimated for maximum combat potential.

## Early Game (Turns 1-3)

**Goals:**
- Establish 2 gates and at least 1-2 Cathedrals.
- Earn spellbooks as fast as possible. Your four Cathedral requirements plus two free monster giveaways make this faction one of the fastest to reach Unlimited Combat.
- Decide your role: cooperative social engineer or aggressive bully. You can blend both approaches.
- Use Dematerialization every Doom Phase to reposition units for free -- whether that means setting up a Cathedral build or threatening an opponent's gate.

**Priorities:**
- Build Cathedrals non-adjacent to save Power (1 cost vs 3 cost).
- Talk to everyone. Negotiate Cathedral placement -- offer the Power bonus from Worship Services in exchange for a non-aggression pact.
- Do not let Cultists get captured needlessly. Every point of Power matters.
- Time your free spellbook requirements strategically. Give away cheapest monsters early before opponents have summoned them. Give away most expensive monsters after some opponents already have their big units out.
- PSA to opponents: do not awaken a Great Old One into an area where the Ancients have Dematerialized. Unholy Ground will punish this severely.

## Mid Game (Turns 4-5)

By Turn 4, you should have all six spellbooks and Unlimited Combat. This is when the Ancients become one of the most dangerous factions on the board.

**Priorities:**
- **Ritual every turn.** With two gates, Consecration, and Worship Services subsidizing your Power, aim for at least five doom per Doom Phase. With all four Cathedrals in play, you get two Elder Signs per ritual -- that is enormous.
- **Assemble the death ball.** Two or three Yothans with Reanimated and Unmen create a roaming force of 20-27 combat dice. Dematerialize this group to wherever the biggest threat is.
- **Build a Cathedral, then Unlimited Combat.** This combo lets you place a Cathedral as your normal action, then immediately fight in that area. If a Great Old One is present, Unholy Ground eliminates it. This is devastating and opponents have no window to react.
- **Exploit the train of pain.** Declare Unlimited Combat, get pained into an adjacent area, and immediately fight there too. With two Yothans (14 dice), even a pained-out force is terrifying. Chain 2-3 fights in a single turn to suppress multiple opponents.
- **Manage your social contracts.** Keep feeding Festival Power to your ally. If someone breaks their deal with you, punish them by removing their Cathedral (Worship Services Power gone) and possibly sniping their Great Old One with Unholy Ground.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

The Ancients close out games through consistent ritualing plus Consecration Elder Signs. You do not have an Immortal-style burst like Great Cthulhu, but your steady doom accumulation with bonus Elder Signs is very reliable.

**Priorities:**
- Maintain at least two gates and keep ritualing. Every ritual with all four Cathedrals nets you two Elder Signs.
- Keep opponents from reaching three or more gates themselves. Use your combat superiority and Unholy Ground threat to suppress anyone pulling ahead.
- Yothans are expendable in the late game. If trading a Yothan to eliminate a Great Old One prevents an opponent from winning, that is an excellent trade. You started with 21 dice worth of Yothans -- spending that resource to deny others the game is exactly what they are for.
- Continue using Festival Unmen for zero-cost stalling actions. Outlast opponents who are spending Power faster than you.
- Watch for opponents trying to keep you off gates. Two gates is sustainable; one gate makes ritualing unaffordable. Fight hard to maintain your gate count.

## Power Combos & Synergies

**Dematerialization + Unholy Ground:**
The signature combo. Teleport your force into an opponent's area during the Doom Phase for free. If they have a Great Old One there (or awaken one into your area), build a Cathedral and snipe it with Unholy Ground. Even a lone Reanimated paired with a Cultist is a lethal threat if a Cathedral is nearby.

**Build Cathedral + Unlimited Combat:**
Once you have Unlimited Combat, build a Cathedral as your normal action, then immediately declare battle. The opponent's Great Old One in that area has no time to flee. This two-step combo is the Ancients' most dangerous late-game play.

**Festival Unmen + Cooperative Ally:**
Feed Power to a cooperative player via Festival while taking zero-cost actions to stall. The ally protects your gates, attacks your enemies, or influences turn order in your favor. Meanwhile, you outlast everyone else by spending nothing while they burn through Power.

**Yothan Death Ball + Reanimated + Unmen:**
Three Yothans (21 dice) + three Reanimated (6 dice) + Unmen and Cultists as ablative shields = 27+ combat dice. Dematerialize this formation anywhere on the map and obliterate whatever is there. Unmen and Reanimated absorb kills before your precious Yothans take losses.

**Worship Services + Consecration + Ritual:**
Cathedrals on enemy gates generate Power via Worship Services, which subsidizes your ritual cost. Consecration adds Elder Signs on top of the ritual. With three Cathedrals on enemy gates and all four in play, you gain 3 bonus Power and 2 Elder Signs every Doom Phase on top of your normal ritual. This is a self-sustaining doom engine.

**Unholy Ground + Cathedral Removal from Anywhere:**
When you sacrifice a Cathedral for Unholy Ground, it can be from anywhere on the map -- not just the battle area. This means you can sacrifice a Cathedral from a "friendly" opponent's gate while fighting a different opponent elsewhere. Use this to punish former allies who stop cooperating.

## Factions to Watch Out For

**Any faction with a 10-cost Great Old One** should respect Unholy Ground deeply. Nyarlathotep, Hastur, and Yog-Sothoth are all expensive to re-awaken and will stay far away from your Cathedrals if their players are smart. Use this fear as leverage even if you never actually trigger Unholy Ground.

**Factions that can capture your Cultists easily** are dangerous because Power is tight for the Ancients. Without Great Old One protection, anyone can walk into your gate and capture. Negotiate hard to prevent this, and always keep a monster on your gates.

**Factions that deny you table talk** by refusing all deals weaken your social engineering pillar. Against a table full of experienced players who know the Ancients' tricks, you will need to rely more on raw combat and Yothan bombing.

## Matchups

### vs Great Cthulhu
Cthulhu is a combat monster, but Devour does not work on your Yothans because they are Terrors, not Monsters. Unholy Ground can eliminate Cthulhu after any battle in a Cathedral area, forcing a 4-Power re-awakening. Respect Cthulhu's Submerge mobility -- he can appear anywhere -- but know that your combat dice can match or exceed his output.

### vs Black Goat
Black Goat generates a lot of units and wants to be left alone to accumulate doom. Your Yothans can punch through their formations, and Unholy Ground threatens Shub-Niggurath. Black Goat may be a good Worship Services partner early since they appreciate extra Power for their fertility engine. Just be ready to turn on them if they pull ahead.

### vs Crawling Chaos
Madness can scatter your pained units to bad locations, disrupting your death ball. Nyarlathotep is an expensive Great Old One that Unholy Ground can snipe, which gives you leverage. Flight lets Nyarlathotep escape, but if you have a Cathedral in the battle area, he still takes the Unholy Ground hit post-battle. Try to maintain a friendly relationship -- Crawling Chaos makes a better ally than enemy.

### vs Yellow Sign
Yellow Sign's passive doom accumulation can run away from you if unchecked. Use your combat superiority to pressure Hastur and disrupt Desecration stacking. Unholy Ground threatens Hastur (10-cost re-awakening), which is enormous leverage. Yellow Sign may accept a Worship Services Cathedral willingly since they like Power, giving you a loaded gun in their territory.

### vs Opener of the Way
Opener lacks raw combat dice and relies on gate manipulation via Beyond One. Your Yothans outfight anything Opener can field in a straight brawl. Be wary of Yog-Sothoth's combat ability, but Unholy Ground is a strong counter. If Opener already has both Spawns out when you give away most expensive monsters, they only get an Abomination -- a nice denial play.

### vs Sleeper
Sleeper turtles early and stacks units defensively. Your early aggression via Yothan Bombing can disrupt their buildup before they come online. Unholy Ground threatens Tsathoggua. Be aware that if Sleeper has already summoned all Wizards and Serpentmen before you give away cheapest monsters, they might get a free Formless Spawn instead -- time your spellbook requirement carefully.

### vs Windwalker
Windwalker is another aggressive combat faction with strong dice output. Gnoph-Keh grow stronger in groups, so avoid fighting them at full strength. Your Yothans match or exceed their combat potential. Dematerialization gives you superior mobility compared to Windwalker's Arctic-focused movement. Both factions benefit from fighting other people, so a temporary alliance can work.

### vs Tcho-Tcho
Tcho-Tcho earn spellbooks at a pace that rivals your own. Left unchecked, they snowball hard. Your combat superiority lets you punish their relatively fragile units. Use Unholy Ground to threaten their Great Old One and keep them honest. Your shared fast spellbook tempo means races to Unlimited Combat are common -- try to get there first.

### vs Daemon Sultan
Daemon Sultan does not start on the map and may not have a gate when you give away free monsters via your spellbook requirements. If you time these before Daemon Sultan establishes a gate, they get nothing -- a mean but effective denial play. Once they are established, Unholy Ground threatens their Great Old One as it does any other. Their unpredictable doom scoring means you should keep an eye on their total.

### vs Bubastis
Bubastis relies on mobility and indirect strategies rather than raw combat. Your Yothans dramatically outfight their units, giving you the edge in direct confrontation. Use the threat of combat to control their positioning. They may avoid you entirely, which you can leverage politically -- offer non-aggression in exchange for cooperation on turn order or other favors.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building Cathedrals adjacent to each other.** This costs 3 Power instead of 1. Use Dematerialization to position Cultists in non-adjacent areas before building. Every wasted Power point hurts this faction.

2. **Leaving Reanimated alone.** Without a non-Reanimated buddy unit, Reanimated cannot move, capture, or declare battle. Always use the buddy system. A lone Reanimated is dead weight.

3. **Losing Yothans carelessly.** With Extinction, dead Yothans are gone forever. Do not leave them unescorted where opponents can pick them off. Surround them with Unmen and Reanimated as ablative shields. Trade Yothans deliberately for high-value targets like Great Old Ones, not randomly.

4. **Giving away Festival Power randomly.** Pick a cooperative partner and feed them consistently in exchange for concrete favors. Random Power distribution builds no alliances and wastes your social engineering advantage.

5. **Neglecting table talk.** The Ancients are designed around social engineering. If you are not talking, negotiating, and making deals every single turn, you are leaving half the faction's power on the table. Even threats count -- reminding opponents that Unholy Ground exists is free deterrence.

6. **Waiting for all four Cathedrals before ritualing.** One Cathedral with Consecration still gives you one Elder Sign per ritual. Start ritualing as soon as you have two gates and one Cathedral. Do not leave doom on the table waiting for the perfect setup.

7. **Forgetting Dematerialization timing.** Dematerialization happens in the Doom Phase, not the Action Phase. Plan your teleport before the Doom Phase arrives. Lobby the first player to influence turn order so that your Dematerialization leads to a favorable first action next round.

8. **Ignoring the Cathedral glyph placement rule.** When building Cathedrals in Gated areas, only one Cathedral per glyph type is allowed. This rule is easy to miss but can invalidate a build if violated. Make sure both you and your opponents are aware of it.

9. **Skipping Extinction to keep Yothans resummomable.** Paying 6 Power for a Yothan instead of 3 is never worth the insurance of being able to resummon. Take Extinction, save Power, and spend it on moving and fighting instead.

10. **Awakening a Great Old One into the Ancients' area.** This is advice for your opponents, but it applies as a meta-awareness tip for you: if opponents know not to do this, Unholy Ground becomes a deterrent rather than a kill tool. Use the threat just as effectively as the execution.

## Tips & Tricks from the Podcast

- **Dematerialization is your best ability.** It is free, it has no restrictions other than one-area-to-one-area, and it works anywhere on the map regardless of distance. Use it every Doom Phase without exception. Even if you are just repositioning a single Cultist to build a Cathedral next turn, it saves you a Power you would have spent moving.

- **Lobby the first player for turn order.** As the Ancients, turn order is crucial. If you Dematerialize into an opponent's area during the Doom Phase, you want to act before them in the next Action Phase so you can build a Cathedral or declare battle before they can flee. Start politicking before the first player is even decided.

- **The Ancients are at peak danger with Unlimited Combat and three Cathedrals.** The build-Cathedral-then-Unlimited-Combat combo is your most devastating play. Three Cathedrals means you have one to sacrifice for Unholy Ground while keeping two for Worship Services and Consecration.

- **Use the "train of pain."** Declare Unlimited Combat, get pained into an adjacent area, and immediately fight there. Even a diminished force of two Yothans (14 dice) is terrifying. Chain battles across the map in a single turn.

- **Time your free spellbook requirements.** Give away cheapest monsters early (before opponents summon their cheap units) to avoid accidentally gifting expensive ones. Give away most expensive monsters late (after opponents have already summoned theirs) so they get something cheap instead. Denying Daemon Sultan monsters by taking these before they have a gate is a particularly effective move.

- **Three Yothans plus three Reanimated equals 27 combat dice.** That is competing with the absolute maximum dice any faction can roll. Very few formations in the entire game survive this.

- **Keep the Ancients to two gates maximum (advice for opponents).** If you are playing against the Ancients, never let them hold more than two gates. With three gates and Consecration, their doom engine becomes nearly unstoppable. One gate is ideal -- it makes ritualing unaffordable for them.

- **Cathedrals on enemy gates are gifts that can become curses.** Accept Worship Services Power if you want, but understand that the Ancients player can sacrifice that Cathedral via Unholy Ground at any time. They are not being generous -- they are positioning a weapon.
