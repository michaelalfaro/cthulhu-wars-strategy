# The Sleeper

## Overview

The Sleeper is one of the most powerful factions in Cthulhu Wars, and in the right hands, it may very well be the strongest faction in the entire game. Built around the great old one Tsathoggua -- the slothful toad-god from Clark Ashton Smith's Hyperborean tales -- this faction rewards patience, creativity, and strategic timing above all else. Sleeper teaches what may be the most important lesson in Cthulhu Wars: time matters. Having Power left over when everyone else has run dry is enormously impactful, and no faction exploits that truth more ruthlessly than this one.

The Sleeper has a reputation as a "noob stomper," and that reputation is well-earned. New players will get crushed by Lethargy spam without understanding what hit them. But do not mistake this faction for a one-trick pony. Beneath the surface lies a deep toolkit of abilities that reward improvisation and adaptability, particularly Ancient Sorcery, which lets you copy the unique abilities of every other faction at the table. Against experienced opponents, pure Lethargy spam will not cut it -- you will need to master all three levels of Sleeper play to compete.

Sleeper sits right in the middle of the spectrum between doom-focused and combat-focused factions, roughly in the same territory as Opener of the Way. It can brawl with the fighty factions when its Formless Spawn are assembled, and it can outpace doom-focused factions by efficiently converting stolen Gates into ritual opportunities. Consider this guide both a playbook for piloting Sleeper and a "know your enemy" primer, because this is a villain faction that everyone at the table needs to understand.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

Sleeper is a faction built on asymmetric tempo. While other factions spend their Power as fast as possible each turn, Sleeper conserves resources through Lethargy and strikes precisely when opponents are depleted. The faction identity revolves around several key pillars:

- **Patience as a weapon.** Lethargy lets you pass for zero Power, waiting out opponents until the perfect moment to act. This is the faction's signature mechanic, but it is only the foundation, not the whole strategy.
- **Adaptive power through Ancient Sorcery.** Your Serpent Men let you copy other factions' unique abilities, making Sleeper's strength scale with the number of players and the composition of factions at the table. Every game plays differently.
- **Gate theft and repositioning.** Sleeper excels at claiming under-defended Gates late in the action phase, then protecting them with Cursed Slumber, Serpent Men redeployment, and Death from Below reinforcements.
- **Evasion over confrontation.** Energy Nexus combined with Burrow lets you dodge battles entirely, making it nearly impossible for opponents to pin down Tsathoggua. You fight only when you choose to.
- **Heavy upfront investment.** The faction requires spending roughly 22-25 Power across the game just on Spellbook requirements and awakening costs. Managing this investment efficiently is a core skill.

## Spellbook Abilities

### Burrow
**Unlock condition:** Choose from one of the six Spellbook requirements (see below).
**Effect:** Ongoing -- after a move action in which you spend 2 or more Power moving units, regain 1 Power.
**Strategic notes:** This is your bread-and-butter Spellbook and should almost always be taken as one of your first picks. It is one of the best movement abilities in the entire game, and other factions will be jealous of how cheaply you can reposition. The key habit to build: unless you have exactly 1 Power to spend, always move a second unit alongside your primary mover to trigger the Power refund. Moving an Acolyte and a Wizard together to set up a Gate costs you a net of 1 Power instead of 2. Burrow also combines devastatingly with copied abilities like Flight (from Crawling Chaos), turning Sleeper into the most mobile faction on the board.

### Ancient Sorcery
**Unlock condition:** Choose from one of the six Spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** 1-cost action -- Remove a Serpent Man from the map and place it on an enemy's faction card. For the remainder of that turn, you have access to that enemy faction's unique ability. If the unique ability mentions a faction's great old one, it is considered to also include Tsathoggua. During the Doom phase, gain 1 Power and return the Serpent Man to any area of your choice on the map.
**Strategic notes:** Easily one of the coolest Spellbooks in the entire game. This ability scales with player count and faction composition -- more factions at the table means more options for you. Even when the copied abilities are mediocre, you still gain Power from the Serpent Man return and can redeploy them strategically to reinforce stolen Gates or threaten remote areas. Important rules note: the Serpent Men return at the *end* of the Doom phase (confirmed in the Onslaught 4 printing), meaning you cannot place a Serpent Man first and then use Death from Below into that area -- Death from Below happens first.

**Ancient Sorcery Tier List:**
- **S Tier:** Flight (Crawling Chaos) -- the best ability to copy, period. Combined with Burrow, it makes Sleeper terrifyingly mobile. Hibernate (Windwalker) -- outstanding for a faction that needs to spend so much Power on Spellbook requirements. Lethargy into Hibernate can push you well over 20 Power.
- **A Tier:** Beyond One (Opener) -- great mobility, and Formless Spawn qualify at cost 3. Sycophancy (Tcho-Tcho) -- forces non-Sleeper, non-Tcho-Tcho players to give away doom when they ritual. Dematerialization (Ancients) -- free repositioning of your big clump of units during the Doom phase. Immortal (Great Cthulhu) -- halves re-awakening cost to 4 Power if Tsathoggua dies, though if you are playing well, the toad should not be dying. Psychosis (Yellow Sign) -- helps recover captured Acolytes cheaply.
- **B Tier:** Feast (Yellow Sign) -- occasionally useful for picking up a couple Power from desecration tokens. Fertility Cult (Black Goat) -- mostly redundant with Death from Below, but can help in emergencies.
- **F Tier:** Lunacy (Bubastis) -- does literally nothing for Sleeper since you have no cats. Eternal Servitude (Invasion) -- negligible value.

### Capture Monster
**Unlock condition:** Choose from one of the six Spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** 1-cost action -- Tsathoggua can capture enemy monsters in the same manner Cultists are captured. Captured monsters are sacrificed for 1 Power in the next Gather Power phase.
**Strategic notes:** A strong but situational Spellbook. Newer players are often tempted to take this early because the idea of eating monsters is appealing, but it is generally one of the weaker picks relative to Burrow, Energy Nexus, and Ancient Sorcery. That said, Capture Monster is devastating against specific factions. It makes Sleeper a nightmare for Bubastis, since Tsathoggua can simply eat cats stationed at your Gates. It is also effective against other high-value, low-count units like Spawn of Yog-Sothoth, Daemon Sultan Larvae, and Dark Young holding down Gates for Black Goat.

### Cursed Slumber
**Unlock condition:** Choose from one of the six Spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** 1-cost action -- Remove a Gate you control and its Cultists from the map, placing them on your faction card. This Gate and its Cultists still provide Power and count for doom points but are immune to enemy actions. As a 1-cost action, you can return the Gate and Cultists to any area lacking a Gate. You may only have one Gate on your faction card at a time.
**Strategic notes:** A highly versatile and underutilized Spellbook. Most players use it once to stash a Gate on their faction card and never touch it again, but there is far more flexibility here. Defensively, if an opponent moves toward your under-defended Gate, you can yank it onto your faction card before they can capture it, wasting their Power. Offensively, you can redeploy the Gate to remote, isolated areas at the end of the action phase, then use it as a staging point for future Gate theft. The best tactic is to actively cycle Gates on and off your faction card -- steal a Gate, protect it with Cursed Slumber next turn, then redeploy your stored Gate elsewhere. This creates a kind of poor-man's Beyond One for Gate repositioning. Particularly nasty against Great Cthulhu: if you steal the South Pacific Gate and Cursed Slumber it, Cthulhu cannot re-awaken there without first rebuilding a Gate.

### Demand Sacrifice
**Unlock condition:** Choose from one of the six Spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** Pre-battle -- if Tsathoggua is in play, your enemy chooses one of the following before a battle with you: you gain an Elder Sign, OR all their kill results count as pains on your units in this battle.
**Strategic notes:** One of the most annoying abilities in the game for your opponents. Most of the time when you are in a big clump, opponents will choose to convert kills to pains, since separating your units is less devastating for them than handing you Elder Signs. They will only give you Elder Signs when they are going for a killing blow and believe they can eliminate enough units to cripple you. If you can extract even 2-3 Elder Signs from Demand Sacrifice over the course of a game, it has more than paid for itself. The critical reminder: always announce Demand Sacrifice *before* dice are rolled. Do not let opponents roll first and then remember -- the timing matters.

### Energy Nexus
**Unlock condition:** Choose from one of the six Spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** Ongoing -- just before a battle occurs in an area containing a Wizard, you may take one action that originates in that area for its normal Power cost. When you finish that action, the battle proceeds starting with pre-battle Spellbooks and abilities.
**Strategic notes:** This is your best Spellbook, full stop. Newer Sleeper players tend to underrate it, but Energy Nexus is what elevates the faction from strong to nearly unstoppable. The primary use: when an opponent battles you in an area with Tsathoggua and a Wizard, you spend 2 Power on a move action (Burrow refunds 1), moving Tsathoggua and the Wizard out of the battle area. If those were your only units there, the battle simply does not happen. Your opponent just wasted their Power moving in and declaring a battle, and you spent a net of 1 Power to escape. Combined with Lethargy, you can sit around doing nothing, and when someone finally commits to attacking you, you just leave. Even factions with unlimited combat cannot catch you efficiently -- they would need to pay for another move and another battle each time, while you only spend 1 net Power per dodge. This is especially critical against Crawling Chaos, where getting battled and madness-pained is one of the fastest ways to lose Tsathoggua. Energy Nexus is even stronger than Demand Sacrifice because the opponent never even gets to roll dice against you.

## Spellbook Unlock Requirements

Sleeper's six Spellbook requirements follow a thematic pattern: four of them require spending Power, which creates a significant resource burden unique to this faction.

1. **Pay 3 Power as an action; each other player gains 1 Power.** Best used when opponents are at zero or very low Power so they cannot do anything meaningful with the gift. Can also be used as social engineering -- give everyone a Power and pressure them to use it against a common threat.
2. **Pay 3 Power as an action; an opponent of your choice gains 3 Power.** A powerful deal-making tool but dangerous if used carelessly. Three Power is enough to build a Gate -- do not give this away without getting something in return. Use it to prop up a weaker player as a distraction or to create a temporary ally.
3. **Pay 3 Power as an action; each other player loses 1 Power.** One of the most impactful Spellbook requirements in all of Cthulhu Wars. Best used early in Action Phase 2, right before factions like Crawling Chaos, Great Cthulhu, or Yellow Sign are about to awaken. Dropping an opponent from 10 to 9 Power can completely wreck their planned opening. Expect salt, but this is devastating.
4. **Perform a Ritual of Annihilation.** Ideally done when rituals are cheap (5 Power). Do not wait for rituals to become expensive -- it is better to ritual for 5 Power, get 1 doom and no Elder Sign, than to be locked behind an 8-Power ritual later. Prioritize clearing this requirement early.
5. **Roll 6 or more dice in combat.** Nearly automatic once Tsathoggua is in play, since Tsathoggua's combat alone can be 6+ dice against an opponent with high Power. This is the preferred requirement to leave for last since it will happen naturally.
6. **Awaken Tsathoggua.** Requires a Formless Spawn on the map and 8 Power. The Spawn requirement is critical -- if opponents kill all your Spawns, you literally cannot awaken.

Total minimum Power expenditure for all requirements: approximately 22-25 Power (9 for the three pay-3 requirements, 5+ for the ritual, 8 for awakening, plus monster summoning costs). Budget accordingly.

## Units

### Cultists (Acolytes)
**Cost:** 1 | **Combat:** 0 | **Count:** 6
Standard Cultists with no faction-specific Spellbooks that interact with them directly. Their primary role is controlling Gates and generating Power. Sleeper Cultists are high-priority capture targets for opponents because this faction's entire strategy depends on maintaining Gate control. Protect them when possible, but understand that losing a few is part of the game -- focus on the Gates and the toad.

### Wizards
**Cost:** 1 | **Combat:** 0 | **Count:** 2
The cheapest monster in Sleeper's pool at just 1 Power, but with zero combat dice. Do not underestimate these units despite their lack of combat value. Wizards are the key to Energy Nexus -- you need a Wizard present in any area where you want the option to take a free action before battle. The standard operating procedure is to keep one Wizard traveling with Tsathoggua at all times, forming the core "roaming toad" pair that makes the faction so elusive. Get both Wizards summoned early so that Death from Below starts producing more expensive monsters instead of wasting free deployments on 1-cost Wizards.

### Serpent Men
**Cost:** 2 | **Combat:** 1 | **Count:** 3
Forgettable in combat but essential to the faction's identity through Ancient Sorcery. Serpent Men are placed on enemy faction cards to copy unique abilities, then return to the map at the end of the Doom phase in any area of your choice. This redeployment flexibility is powerful -- use returning Serpent Men to reinforce stolen Gates, defend remote positions, or set up future actions. Even when the copied abilities are weak, the 1 Power you gain per Serpent Man return and the strategic redeployment make Ancient Sorcery worthwhile every turn.

### Formless Spawn
**Cost:** 3 | **Combat:** Equal to total number of Spawns in play + Tsathoggua | **Count:** 4
The heavy hitters of the Sleeper roster. Each Formless Spawn's combat value equals the total count of all Spawns on the map plus Tsathoggua. With all four Spawns and Tsathoggua in play, each Spawn rolls 5 dice -- that is 20 dice from Spawns alone before adding Tsathoggua's contribution. This makes the assembled Spawn army capable of going toe-to-toe with any fighty faction in the game. At 3 Power each, Spawns are your most expensive summon, but once your cheaper monsters are deployed, Death from Below starts giving you free Spawns every Doom phase. A critical detail: you must have at least one Formless Spawn in play to awaken Tsathoggua. Savvy opponents will hunt Spawns to prevent re-awakening.

### Tsathoggua (Great Old One)
**Cost:** 8 | **Combat:** Opponent's current Power or 2, whichever is greater | **Count:** 1
The lazy, toad-like great old one whose unique ability Lethargy defines the faction. Tsathoggua's combat scales with the opponent's Power -- against a full-Power opponent, the toad can easily hit 6+ dice by itself, but against a spent opponent it rolls only 2. Pick your fights accordingly. Tsathoggua does not require a Gate to awaken, only a Formless Spawn in play and 8 Power. The toad is placed in the area with the Spawn. Keeping Tsathoggua alive is the single most important objective for the Sleeper player. Without it, you lose access to Lethargy, Demand Sacrifice, Capture Monster, and the Spawn combat bonus. The 8 Power re-awakening cost is brutal -- avoid dying at all costs.

**Lethargy (unique GOO ability):** Zero-cost action. If Tsathoggua is in play, do nothing. This counts as an action. The signature ability of the faction. You can freely pass each time your turn comes around, spending zero Power while opponents deplete their resources. Against new players, Lethargy spam alone can win games. Against experienced opponents, you need to mix Lethargy with meaningful actions to keep opponents guessing.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

### Turn 1 (Action Phase 1)

You start with 6 Acolytes and a Gate in North America (fixed starting location with a Sleeper glyph). You begin with 8 Power. There are three main opening lines:

**Opening A -- "Summon All the Things" (Safe):**
Spend all 8 Power summoning 3 Serpent Men (6 Power) and 2 Wizards (2 Power). No second Gate. This is the safest opening because it sets up a guaranteed free Formless Spawn from Death from Below in Turn 2 (since all cheaper monsters are deployed), and you will have exactly 8 Power to awaken Tsathoggua. The downside is less Doom from fewer Gates and two turns of zero board interaction, but against strong players who would punish a greedy Gate build, safety has real value.

**Opening B -- "Gate + Wizard + Spellbook" (Balanced):**
Move an Acolyte to an adjacent area (1 Power), build a Gate (3 Power), summon a Wizard (1 Power), then pay 3 Power for one of your Spellbook requirements. This gives you 2 Gates, some Doom progress, and a Spellbook unlock. The "each other player loses 1 Power" requirement is devastating if used in Action Phase 1, especially if it disrupts someone's Turn 2 awakening plans. The "each other player gains 1 Power" requirement is also good here since opponents cannot do much with 1 extra Power this early.

**Opening C -- "Gate + Wizard + Spawn" (Greedy/Strongest):**
Move, build a Gate, summon a Wizard, and summon a Formless Spawn. This is the strongest opening but also the greediest. You will have 10 Power and a Spawn ready for Tsathoggua in Turn 2. The downside is that Death from Below will only produce a free Wizard (since your Serpent Men are still in the pool), and having 2 Gates early makes you a target. Recommended against newer players who will not punish your greed.

**Avoid:** Building two Gates in Turn 1 (three Gates total). You have no way to defend them, and it attracts far too much attention.

### Turn 2 (Action Phase 2)

The central question: are you awakening Tsathoggua this turn?

If you have a Formless Spawn on the board and 8+ Power, awaken Tsathoggua. You will be mostly spent afterward (maybe 2 Power remaining for a Serpent Man summon). Take your awakening Spellbook and ideally Burrow if you have not already.

If you are not awakening, use this turn to pay for one of your 3-Power Spellbook requirements. The "each other player loses 1 Power" requirement is especially potent in Action Phase 2 -- it can derail Crawling Chaos or Great Cthulhu right before they planned to awaken. Take Burrow as your Spellbook if you have not yet. Start positioning for a third Gate.

### Turn 3 (Action Phase 3)

Get Tsathoggua out if you have not done so already. Pay for at least one more Spellbook requirement, prioritizing the Ritual of Annihilation if ritual costs are climbing. From here, focus on keeping Tsathoggua safe, maintaining your Gate count, and steadily paying off remaining Spellbook requirements. Aim to have at least one 3-Power requirement completed per action phase starting from Turn 2.

## Early Game (Turns 1-3)

The early game for Sleeper is all about infrastructure investment. You need to deploy your cheap monsters (Wizards and Serpent Men), awaken Tsathoggua, start paying for Spellbook requirements, and establish at least 2-3 Gates. This is a lot to accomplish, and you will feel Power-starved. The total investment to get fully online is roughly 22-25 Power, so every point counts.

Key priorities:
- Get both Wizards out early so Death from Below produces expensive monsters instead of cheap ones.
- Awaken Tsathoggua by Turn 2 or Turn 3 at the latest.
- Take Burrow as one of your first Spellbooks -- it pays for itself almost immediately.
- Start paying for 3-Power Spellbook requirements as soon as practical. Do not hoard them for later.
- If rituals are still cheap (5 Power), strongly consider ritualing early even if you only get 1 Doom and no Elder Sign. Being locked behind an 8-Power ritual in the late game is crippling.

## Mid Game (Turns 4-5)

By the mid game, Tsathoggua should be awake and you should have most or all of your Spellbooks. This is where the three levels of Sleeper play come into effect:

**Level 1 -- Lethargy Spam:** Just sit there and wait until everyone is out of Power, then go steal Gates. This works against new players but experienced opponents will come after you and keep you pinned to 1-2 Gates.

**Level 2 -- Big Ball Defense:** Clump all your units together -- Acolytes, Spawns, Tsathoggua, Wizards -- into a massive defensive blob and spam Lethargy. New players will never crack this formation. But veteran players, especially those piloting fighty factions like Great Cthulhu or Windwalker, can throw 20+ dice at your wall late in the game. Crawling Chaos is particularly dangerous since Madness pains your units to undesirable locations. Good players will cooperate to dissolve your defenses.

**Level 3 -- The Roaming Toad (The Way):** This is the correct way to play Sleeper at a high level. Alternate between sleeping (Lethargy), doing mean things (stealing Gates, capturing Cultists), and Burrow-moving with Tsathoggua and a Wizard. The Wizard enables Energy Nexus, so if anyone comes to fight you, you simply move away for 1 net Power. You condition opponents to expect you to spend Power, then surprise them with Lethargy. You keep them guessing whether you will act or sleep. At this level, it takes a coordinated group effort from multiple opponents to stop you, and even then they may struggle.

Focus on stealing under-defended Gates when opponents are low on Power. Use Ancient Sorcery to copy Flight (if Crawling Chaos is present) for unparalleled mobility, or Hibernate (if Windwalker is present) to supercharge your Power generation.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

In the late game, Sleeper should be aiming for the final push. Your priorities:

- **Accumulate Elder Signs** through Demand Sacrifice and rituals. Even 2-3 Elder Signs from combat can be game-winning.
- **Assemble your Spawn army** if you need to punch through a defensive position. Four Spawns plus Tsathoggua roll 20+ dice -- enough to brawl with any faction.
- **Defend stolen Gates** with Serpent Men redeployment, Death from Below Spawn placement, and Cursed Slumber. A stolen Gate that gets Cursed Slumbered onto your faction card is gone forever from your opponent's perspective.
- **Bank Power through Ancient Sorcery** even if you are not copying useful abilities. Three Serpent Men returning equals 3 extra Power, which can fund a final ritual.
- The preferred last Spellbook requirement is "roll 6 or more dice in combat" since it happens naturally and does not cost Power.

## Power Combos & Synergies

- **Energy Nexus + Burrow + Wizard:** The core defensive combo. When battled, move Tsathoggua and a Wizard away for a net cost of 1 Power. The battle does not happen. Opponents must spend move + battle Power again to pursue, while you only spend 1 Power per dodge.
- **Lethargy + Energy Nexus:** Sit around doing nothing until someone attacks, then dodge. Opponents spend Power fruitlessly while you conserve everything.
- **Ancient Sorcery (Flight) + Burrow:** The ultimate mobility package. With Crawling Chaos in the game, copy Flight to move anywhere on the map while Burrow refunds Power. Steal Gates across the entire board.
- **Ancient Sorcery (Hibernate) + Lethargy:** Copy Windwalker's Hibernate, spam Lethargy to stay idle, then Hibernate to bank massive Power. You can exceed 20 Power this way, funding expensive rituals and Spellbook requirements effortlessly.
- **Cursed Slumber + Gate Theft:** Steal a Gate late in the action phase, then Cursed Slumber it onto your faction card next turn before the opponent can reclaim it. The Gate is now untouchable.
- **Death from Below + Formless Spawn:** Once all cheaper monsters are deployed, Death from Below gives you a free 3-cost Spawn every Doom phase. Place it at any area with your units -- including stolen Gates that need reinforcement.
- **Capture Monster + Gate Defense:** Tsathoggua can eat monsters that opponents leave near your Gates, particularly devastating against Bubastis cats, Dark Young, and other high-value solo units.
- **Demand Sacrifice + Spawn Wall:** When opponents do commit to fighting your assembled force, Demand Sacrifice either gives you a free Elder Sign or converts their kills to pains, preserving your units.

## Factions to Watch Out For

**Crawling Chaos** is your biggest threat. Madness pain makes Energy Nexus less reliable (you get pained to bad locations even if you flee), and Flight being available for Ancient Sorcery copying is both a blessing and a reminder that Nyarlathotep can fly around the map to chase you. If Crawling Chaos cooperates with other players to pin you down, you are in trouble.

**Great Cthulhu** is the bully faction that will come for your Gates. With Devour and unlimited combat dice in the late game, Cthulhu can crack through your defenses. Steal the South Pacific Gate and Cursed Slumber it if you want to be truly mean. A Cthulhu player who cannot re-awaken is a neutered Cthulhu player.

**Windwalker** deserves special attention if you are copying Hibernate. It is 100% Windwalker's job to hunt you down and prevent you from Hibernating repeatedly. Expect aggression if Windwalker is at the table.

## Matchups

### vs Great Cthulhu
Cthulhu wants to bully you with Devour and overwhelming combat dice. Steal the South Pacific Gate and Cursed Slumber it to deny re-awakening. Use Energy Nexus to dodge battles before Devour triggers. In the late game, Cthulhu with unlimited combat can crack your Spawn wall, so do not rely solely on defensive blobbing.

### vs Black Goat
Black Goat is relatively manageable. Capture Monster can eat Dark Young left guarding Gates, and Fertility Cult is not a great Ancient Sorcery target since you already get free units from Death from Below. Black Goat's Shub-Niggurath can be imposing in combat, but you generally want to avoid direct fights and outmaneuver them with mobility.

### vs Crawling Chaos
Your most dangerous matchup. Madness pain makes fighting Crawling Chaos extremely risky -- you can lose Tsathoggua quickly if pained into bad positions. However, Flight is the single best ability to copy with Ancient Sorcery, so Crawling Chaos's presence is a double-edged sword. Prioritize Energy Nexus to dodge Crawling Chaos battles entirely rather than relying on Demand Sacrifice.

### vs Yellow Sign
Yellow Sign's turn structure means they often want to awaken in Action Phase 2 with a specific Power count. Use the "each other player loses 1 Power" Spellbook requirement to disrupt their plans. Feast is a mediocre Ancient Sorcery target, and Psychosis is situationally useful for recovering captured Acolytes. Not your hardest matchup, but do not ignore their doom potential.

### vs Opener of the Way
Beyond One is a solid A-tier Ancient Sorcery copy, giving your Spawns free movement through Gates. Opener tends to be focused on its own doom engine and may not prioritize attacking you. Respect Yog-Sothoth's combat power in the late game, but you can generally coexist and focus on stealing from weaker targets.

### vs Windwalker
If Windwalker is present, Hibernate is an S-tier Ancient Sorcery copy. However, expect Windwalker to target you aggressively to prevent you from exploiting their ability. Windwalker's late-game combat dice (20+) can overwhelm your Spawn wall. Use Energy Nexus to avoid unfavorable engagements and do not let them catch Tsathoggua without an escape plan.

### vs Tcho-Tcho
Sycophancy is an excellent A-tier copy with Ancient Sorcery. If both you and Tcho-Tcho have Sycophancy active, every other faction must give away doom to someone whenever they ritual. Tcho-Tcho tends to be aggressive early but can be outmaneuvered in the mid and late game once you have your full toolkit online.

### vs Ancients
Dematerialization is a solid A-tier Ancient Sorcery copy for free repositioning during the Doom phase. Ancients can be frustrating to fight due to their defensive mechanics, but you generally want to avoid direct confrontation and focus on Gate control. Ancients' ritual requirements can make the Ritual of Annihilation Spellbook requirement more expensive for you.

### vs Daemon Sultan
Daemon Sultan is another villain faction with strong doom generation. Capture Monster can eat Larvae, which are high-value targets. Focus on your own tempo and do not let Daemon Sultan's doom output distract you from paying for your Spellbook requirements. This is a race -- keep pace on doom or you will fall behind.

### vs Bubastis
Sleeper is a nightmare for Bubastis. Capture Monster lets Tsathoggua eat cats, which is devastating for a faction that depends on its unique monsters. Lunacy does literally nothing for you via Ancient Sorcery (no cats in your roster), so there is no reason to copy their ability. Focus on eating their cats and controlling Gates -- Bubastis will struggle to keep up.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pure Lethargy spam against experienced players.** Level 1 play only works against beginners. Veteran players will pin you to 1-2 Gates and never let you expand. You must mix Lethargy with meaningful actions.
2. **Neglecting Spellbook payments.** With 22-25 Power in total requirements, you cannot afford to delay. Aim for at least one 3-Power payment per action phase. Being locked behind expensive rituals or unpaid requirements in the late game is devastating.
3. **Letting Tsathoggua die.** The 8-Power re-awakening cost is crippling, and you lose access to Lethargy, Demand Sacrifice, and Capture Monster. Use Energy Nexus to dodge dangerous fights. If the toad dies multiple times, you will almost certainly lose.
4. **Taking Capture Monster early.** It is appealing but less impactful than Burrow, Energy Nexus, or Ancient Sorcery in the opening turns. Prioritize your mobility and evasion tools first.
5. **Ignoring Formless Spawn count.** You need at least one Spawn on the map to awaken Tsathoggua. If opponents kill all your Spawns after killing Tsathoggua, you are locked out of re-awakening entirely. Protect your Spawns.
6. **Waiting too long for rituals.** If rituals are at 5-6 Power, just do it even for minimal doom. Paying 8+ Power for a ritual later is backbreaking for a faction that already spends so much on Spellbook requirements.
7. **Building two extra Gates in Turn 1.** Three Gates with no defensive units is indefensible and paints a massive target on your back. Two Gates maximum in the opening.
8. **Not always triggering Burrow.** If you are spending 2+ Power on movement anyway, always move a second unit to get the refund. Leaving free Power on the table adds up over a game.
9. **Forgetting to announce Demand Sacrifice before dice are rolled.** The timing matters -- always declare it before the battle starts rolling.
10. **Using Cursed Slumber only once.** Most players stash a Gate and forget about it. Actively cycle Gates on and off your faction card to reposition and protect stolen Gates.

## Tips & Tricks from the Podcast

- **The Wizard-Toad pair is sacred.** Always keep a Wizard with Tsathoggua to enable Energy Nexus. This pairing is the backbone of Level 3 play and makes you nearly uncatchable.
- **Ancient Sorcery is a Power bank.** Even if you are not copying useful abilities, placing all 3 Serpent Men on faction cards gives you 3 Power during the Doom phase. Use this to help fund Spellbook requirements and rituals.
- **Serpent Men redeploy anywhere.** When they return from faction cards, they go to any area on the map. Use them to reinforce stolen Gates, defend remote positions, or set up future attacks on exposed Cultists.
- **Death from Below does not require a Gate.** The unit goes into any area with at least one of your units. Use it to reinforce areas far from your Gates where you have stray Cultists or the roaming Toad.
- **Cursed Slumber as reactive defense.** If someone moves toward your Gate, yank it onto your faction card before they can capture. They just wasted their move Power for nothing.
- **Punish awakening turns.** The "each other player loses 1 Power" requirement is devastating when used in Action Phase 2, right before factions like Crawling Chaos or Great Cthulhu are planning to awaken. Dropping them from 10 to 9 Power can ruin their entire turn.
- **Condition your opponents.** The goal of Level 3 play is to make opponents uncertain about whether you will Lethargy or act. Once they cannot predict your behavior, they cannot efficiently allocate their Power against you.
- **Hunt for opportunities to capture stray Cultists.** The roaming Toad with Burrow and Flight (via Ancient Sorcery) can reach isolated Cultists and capture them, denying opponents Gate control.
- **If Windwalker is at the table, copy Hibernate aggressively.** Lethargy into Hibernate can push you over 20 Power. But expect Windwalker to come after you for it.
- **This faction may be the strongest in the game in the right hands.** Do not play it like a one-trick pony. The combination of patience, evasion, adaptive abilities, and Gate theft gives Sleeper answers to virtually every situation.
