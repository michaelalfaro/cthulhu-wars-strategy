# Great Cthulhu

## Overview

Great Cthulhu is the namesake faction of Cthulhu Wars and one of the original four base game factions. It is a combat-oriented brawler that excels at keeping other factions in check through direct confrontation. The faction starts in the South Pacific Ocean and uses the sea as its staging ground, submerging and emerging to strike anywhere on the map. Great Cthulhu is an excellent introductory faction thanks to its straightforward playstyle -- beat up whoever is winning -- but it rewards experienced players who master the subtle resource management of cycling units through the pool.

**Difficulty:** Beginner-friendly, with a high skill ceiling for advanced unit management.

**Playstyle in a sentence:** You are the police of the table. You hit whoever is getting out of control, and you do not care much about getting hit back.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

Great Cthulhu is the most interactive and policing faction in the game. Where some factions want to turtle up and execute their own plan in isolation, Great Cthulhu thrives on engagement. Your job is to identify whoever is running away with the game -- a Tcho-Tcho left alone, a Yellow Sign snowballing doom -- and crash into them with overwhelming force.

**Core Strengths:**

- Outstanding combat presence. Cthulhu himself rolls 6 dice and Devours a unit before combat even begins.
- Submerge allows you to project force anywhere on the map for minimal Power cost.
- Immortal makes Cthulhu cheap to re-awaken (4 Power) and generates Elder Signs each time.
- Dreams lets you steal gates without moving to them.
- Devolve gives you instant-speed gate defense that costs nothing.
- The Absorb + Devolve + Dreams cycle ("the rain cycle") lets you endlessly recycle units for maximum value.
- Three free Elder Signs built into your spellbook requirements.

**Core Weaknesses:**

- You must fight to earn spellbooks. If opponents deny you targets, you stall.
- Your units on land (especially Deep Ones) are awkward and hard to reposition.
- Crawling Chaos with Madness can scatter your forces to useless locations, wrecking your submerge plans.
- You depend heavily on having a gate in the South Pacific. If it gets removed, re-awakening Cthulhu becomes painful.
- Deep Ones are individually weak (1 die each) and mainly serve as Absorb fodder and Devolve targets.

## Spellbook Abilities

### Submerge
**Unlock condition:** Awaken Cthulhu (automatically available as a spellbook pick when you awaken him).
**Effect:** 1-cost action. If Cthulhu is in an ocean or sea area, remove him from the map along with any or all of your units in that area, placing them on your faction card. Later, as a 0-cost action, place Cthulhu and all accompanying units into any area on the map (including landlocked areas).
**Strategic notes:** This is the single most important spellbook for the faction. Take it first, every time, no exceptions. Submerge is your force projection, your stalling engine, and your doom-rush enabler. Because submerging costs 1 and unsubmerging costs 0, you spend Power at half the rate of opponents taking 1-cost actions. This lets you outlast everyone, then strike when they are out of Power. You can only submerge from an ocean area, so always retreat your pained units back to the ocean when possible.

### Devolve
**Unlock condition:** First Doom Phase (received for free, along with a free Elder Sign).
**Effect:** Ongoing. At the end of any player's action (even if it is not your turn), you may transform one or more of your Acolytes anywhere on the map into Deep Ones.
**Strategic notes:** This is one of the only "instant speed" abilities in Cthulhu Wars. It makes your gates extremely hard to capture. Leave a single Acolyte on a gate; if anyone moves in to capture, Devolve before they get the chance. Now they face a monster and cannot capture without a battle. Then on your next action, recruit a new Acolyte for 1 Power and you have both a controller and a guard. Devolve only works if you have Deep Ones in your pool -- never get all four Deep Ones onto the map at the same time or you lose this critical defensive tool.

### Dreams
**Unlock condition:** Control 3 gates in ocean or sea areas, OR 4 gates exist in ocean or sea areas.
**Effect:** 2-cost action. Choose an area containing an enemy Acolyte/Cultist. That enemy must eliminate one of their Acolytes from that area and replace it with one of your Acolytes from your pool.
**Strategic notes:** Dreams is your gate-stealing engine. If an opponent leaves a gate guarded by only one Acolyte and they are out of Power, spend 2 to take it outright. If they have two Acolytes on the gate, they choose to lose the one not on the gate, so it costs you 4 Power (two Dreams) to steal -- much less attractive. Dreams only works when you have Acolytes in your pool, reinforcing the need to manage your unit cycle carefully. The submerge stalling tactic pairs beautifully with Dreams: outlast your opponents, then steal their gates when they cannot respond.

### Absorb
**Unlock condition:** Kill or Devour 2 enemy units in a single battle.
**Effect:** While a Shoggoth is present in a battle, you may eliminate one or more of your own monsters or Cultists from that area. For each unit removed, add 3 dice to the Shoggoth's combat for that battle.
**Strategic notes:** Absorb is how you break defensive formations. A Shoggoth eating 3 of your own units adds 9 dice to its base 2, for 11 dice from the Shoggoth alone -- plus Cthulhu's 6 and his Devour. A practical "absorb ball" of Cthulhu, a Shoggoth, and 3-4 fodder units easily rolls 17-20+ dice. Against a turtling Tcho-Tcho or a stacked Sleeper, this is how you crack through. The consumed units return to your pool, feeding Dreams and Devolve. That is the rain cycle in action: Absorb eats units, they return to your pool, you Devolve and Dreams with them, then Absorb them again later.

### Regenerate
**Unlock condition:** Kill or Devour 1 enemy unit in battle.
**Effect:** You may apply up to 2 battle results to the same Starspawn when taking losses. If both results are Kills, the Starspawn dies. On any other combination (Kill + Pain, Pain + Pain, single Kill, single Pain), the Starspawn merely retreats.
**Strategic notes:** Regenerate makes Starspawn incredibly durable. They soak up results that would otherwise hit Cthulhu or your other units. A force of Cthulhu plus 2 Starspawn rolls 12 dice plus a Devour, and the Starspawn absorb 2 kills each before going down. This is your precision strike formation -- smaller and cheaper than the Absorb ball but very hard to punish. It is also a good setup for an Immortal play: if Cthulhu does go down, you can re-awaken him for 4 Power and grab an Elder Sign.

### Y'ha-nthlei (Sixth Spellbook)
**Unlock condition:** Automatically received in the Doom Phase after you have achieved all 5 other spellbooks (also grants a free Elder Sign).
**Effect:** Ongoing. During Gather Power, if Cthulhu is in play, gain 1 Power for each enemy-controlled gate in an ocean area.
**Strategic notes:** Against experienced players, this spellbook often provides little bonus Power because savvy opponents refuse to build gates in the ocean. However, it still matters in games where Opener moves gates around with Beyond One, or when Daemon Sultan or Sleeper create chaos gates near ocean spaces. If you can politically convince an ally to build in the ocean "as a favor," Y'ha-nthlei rewards you further. Even without bonus Power, the free Elder Sign from earning your sixth book makes this spellbook valuable by default.

## Units

### Cultists (Acolytes)
- **Cost:** 1 Power to recruit
- **Combat dice:** 0
- **Available:** 6
- **Role:** Gate controllers, Absorb fodder, Devolve targets, Dreams fuel. Great Cthulhu's Acolytes look like raincoat-wearing denizens of Innsmouth. Managing how many are on the map versus in your pool is one of the most important skills for this faction. You need them on gates for Power, but you need them in your pool for Dreams. The rain cycle depends on this balance.

### Deep Ones
- **Cost:** 1 Power to summon
- **Combat dice:** 1
- **Available:** 4
- **Role:** Cheap 1-cost actions for stalling, Devolve targets, Absorb fodder. Deep Ones are not individually powerful, but they represent the cheapest possible action you can take. They are most useful in the ocean where they can be scooped up by Submerge. Avoid leaving them stranded on land with no gate -- they are hard to reposition and do very little on their own. Keep at least 1-2 in your pool at all times to enable Devolve.

### Shoggoths
- **Cost:** 2 Power to summon
- **Combat dice:** 2
- **Available:** 2
- **Role:** Absorb platform. A Shoggoth is the centerpiece of your Absorb ball strategy. You rarely need more than one Shoggoth active at a time. With Absorb, a single Shoggoth eating 3 units becomes an 11-dice monster. They look like a nasty wave covered in eyes, and they are every bit as unpleasant for your opponents as that description suggests.

### Starspawn
- **Cost:** 3 Power to summon
- **Combat dice:** 3
- **Available:** 2
- **Role:** Durable frontline fighters. With Regenerate, Starspawn absorb up to 2 hits before dying (and usually just retreat instead). They are excellent in Cthulhu's strike force when you want a targeted attack rather than the full Absorb ball. A pair of Starspawn with Cthulhu gives you 12 dice plus Devour, with each Starspawn soaking 2 results. This is your go-to formation for precision strikes and Immortal cycling plays.

### Great Cthulhu (Great Old One)
- **Cost:** 10 Power to awaken the first time; 4 Power each subsequent time (Immortal)
- **Combat dice:** 6
- **Awakening requirement:** A gate must exist in the South Pacific (you do not need to control it, but it must be there).
- **Special ability -- Devour:** Pre-battle ability. Before dice are rolled, the enemy must eliminate one of their monsters or Cultists from the battle (their choice). This fuels your kill/devour spellbook requirements and removes a unit before you even roll.
- **Special ability -- Immortal:** Each time Cthulhu is awakened (including the first time), gain 1 Elder Sign. After the first awakening, Cthulhu only costs 4 Power to re-awaken.
- **Role:** Your centerpiece. Cthulhu is the spearhead of every attack, generating Elder Signs through Immortal and removing units through Devour. At 6 combat dice plus Devour, he is one of the scariest Great Old Ones in a fight. Protect the South Pacific gate -- if it disappears, re-awakening Cthulhu becomes a logistical nightmare.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

### Turn 1 (Action Phase 1) -- 8 Power

**Standard Opening (recommended):**
1. Move an Acolyte to an adjacent ocean area (1 Power). Remaining: 7.
2. Build a gate in that ocean area (3 Power). Remaining: 4.
3. Summon a Deep One at the new ocean gate (1 Power). Remaining: 3.
4. Summon a Starspawn at your starting gate in South Pacific (3 Power). Remaining: 0.

This gives you 2 gates, each guarded by a monster. You are set up to awaken Cthulhu on Turn 2. You can vary steps 3-4: instead of a Starspawn, you could summon a Deep One + Shoggoth at your starting gate (1 + 2 = 3 Power) to prepare for early Absorb play.

**Greedy Double-Gate Opening (situational):**
1. Move to an ocean area (1 Power). Build a gate (3 Power). Remaining: 4.
2. Move to another ocean area (1 Power). Build a gate (3 Power). Remaining: 0.

This gets you 3 ocean gates immediately and earns your ocean gates spellbook. Take Devolve so you can protect your unguarded gates. This is risky against experienced players who will try to capture you, but if you can talk another player (like Crawling Chaos) into both going greedy, it can work.

**High Priest Opening (if using that expansion):**
1. Move to an ocean area (1 Power). Build a gate (3 Power). Remaining: 4.
2. Summon a Deep One at the new ocean gate (1 Power). Remaining: 3.
3. Recruit a High Priest at South Pacific (3 Power). Remaining: 0.

Even if someone captures your South Pacific gate, you start Turn 2 with at least 10 Power thanks to the High Priest, so you can still awaken Cthulhu.

### Turn 2 (Action Phase 2) -- Typically 10 Power

**Primary plan (80%+ of games): Awaken Cthulhu.**
- Spend 10 Power to awaken Cthulhu in the South Pacific. Gain 1 Elder Sign.
- Take Submerge as your spellbook. Always. No exceptions.
- You also receive your free first-doom-phase spellbook (take Devolve if you have not already) and a free Elder Sign.

**Backup plan (if disrupted below 10 Power):**
- If Sleeper used their "everyone loses 1 Power" ability or someone captured a gate, you may be at 9 Power or less.
- Instead: Move to a third ocean area (1 Power), build a gate (3 Power). This earns your ocean gates spellbook. Take Dreams.
- You now have 5 Power remaining -- enough to Dreams twice and potentially steal opponent gates while they are tapped out.
- Awaken Cthulhu on Turn 3 instead, when you will start with 12+ Power.

### Turn 3 (Action Phase 3) -- 10-14 Power

This is your breakout turn. Your goals:
1. **Get your combat spellbooks.** You need to kill/devour 1 enemy unit and kill/devour 2 enemy units. Ideally, find one battle where you can get 3+ kills/devours to earn both books simultaneously. Submerge with Cthulhu and a strike force, pop up next to a juicy target, Devour one unit pre-battle, then roll enough dice to kill 2 more.
2. **Build your third ocean gate** if you have not already (earns the ocean gates spellbook if still needed).
3. By the end of Turn 3 or the start of Turn 4, you should have 5 spellbooks. Your 6th arrives automatically in the next Doom Phase, granting you unlimited combat -- and that changes everything.

## Early Game (Turns 1-3)

**Goals:**
- Establish 2-3 ocean gates.
- Awaken Cthulhu (ideally Turn 2).
- Earn your combat spellbooks through at least one decisive fight.
- Take Submerge first, then Devolve, then Dreams (adjust order based on what spellbooks you unlock first).

**Priorities:**
- Do not overextend on land. Your power base is the ocean.
- Use Devolve defensively to protect gates left with only an Acolyte.
- Keep at least 1 Acolyte and 1-2 Deep Ones in your pool at all times for Devolve and Dreams.
- When retreating pained units, send them to ocean areas so Submerge can pick them up.
- Look for one big fight to knock out both combat spellbook requirements at once. A battle against an opponent with 3+ units where Cthulhu Devours one and you roll 2+ kills is the ideal.

## Mid Game (Turns 4-5)

By Turn 4, you should have all 6 spellbooks and unlimited combat. This is when Great Cthulhu becomes terrifying.

**Priorities:**
- **Police the leader.** Identify whoever has the most doom or the strongest board position and hit them. This is your job, and the table will generally tolerate your aggression because you are keeping the game balanced.
- **Use the submerge stall.** Submerge for 1, unsubmerge for 0. You spend Power at half the rate of everyone else. Outlast them, then strike when they are tapped out.
- **Execute the rain cycle.** Absorb units in battle (they return to your pool), Devolve Acolytes into Deep Ones for defense, Dreams away undefended gates. Repeat.
- **Start ritualing when appropriate.** With 3+ gates and all spellbooks, ritual to accumulate doom. Each ritual with Cthulhu in play gives you doom and an Elder Sign.
- **Maintain 2-3 gates minimum.** Do not overextend to 4-5 gates unless you can defend them. Three gates with good board control is better than five gates spread thin.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

When you are in the mid-to-high 20s in doom, Great Cthulhu has one of the best doom-rush finishes in the game thanks to Immortal.

**The Immortal Doom Rush:**
- If you are at 27-28 doom with 12 Power, you can close the game during the Action Phase.
- Get into a fight where Cthulhu dies (or let him get killed). Re-awaken Cthulhu for 4 Power -- gain an Elder Sign (worth ~1.67 doom average).
- Get into another fight, die again, re-awaken for 4 Power -- another Elder Sign.
- Two re-awakenings cost about 8-10 Power total and can net you 2-4 Elder Signs in a single Action Phase.

**Important caveat:** Do not make the Immortal cycle your primary win condition. As the community wisdom goes, 4 Power for an average of 1.67 doom is not efficient as a main strategy. Think of it as your closing move -- the last few points to cross the finish line.

**Other late-game priorities:**
- Keep submerging to stay mobile and spend Power slowly.
- Use Dreams aggressively to deny opponents the gates they need to ritual.
- With unlimited combat, chain battles by getting pained from one area into another where you can immediately declare battle again. You can fight 2-3 opponents in a single turn this way.

## Power Combos & Synergies

**The Rain Cycle (Absorb + Devolve + Dreams):**
This is the defining engine of the faction. Units consumed by Absorb return to your pool. From your pool, Acolytes fuel Dreams (gate stealing) and Deep Ones enable Devolve (instant gate defense). You then recruit those Acolytes and Deep Ones back onto the map, and the cycle repeats. Mastering this flow is the difference between a competent Cthulhu player and a great one.

**Submerge + Unlimited Combat:**
Submerge for 1 Power, unsubmerge for 0 anywhere on the map, immediately declare battle. This is a zero-warning strike that opponents cannot predict or prevent. After the battle, if you get pained to an adjacent area, declare battle again. You can chain 2-3 fights in a single round.

**Submerge Stalling:**
Submerge (1 Power) then unsubmerge (0 Power) repeatedly without fighting. You spend 1 Power every 2 actions while opponents spend 1 Power per action at minimum. This lets you outlast everyone, then use Dreams or combat when they are dry.

**Devour + Absorb Ball:**
Cthulhu Devours 1 unit before combat. Then your Shoggoth Absorbs 3-4 of your own units for 9-12 extra dice. You are rolling 17-20+ dice while having already removed an enemy unit. Very few defensive formations survive this.

**Starspawn + Regenerate Strike Team:**
Cthulhu and 2 Starspawn: 12 dice + Devour. Each Starspawn soaks 2 results. This compact force is hard to kill and easy to Submerge with. Excellent for surgical strikes when you do not want to commit your entire army.

## Factions to Watch Out For

**Crawling Chaos** is your biggest threat. Madness lets Nyarlathotep's player choose where all your pained units go. Instead of retreating to the ocean (where you need to be for Submerge), your units get scattered across landlocked areas. This completely disrupts your Submerge-based strategy. Try very hard to maintain a friendly relationship with Crawling Chaos. If they are hostile, your game gets significantly harder.

**Opener of the Way** and **Sleeper** can mess with your South Pacific gate. Opener can use Beyond One to move it; Sleeper can Curse/Slumber it away. If you lose the South Pacific gate and Cthulhu dies, rebuilding and re-awakening is expensive and opponents will not give you the space to do it. Guard South Pacific fiercely.

## Matchups

### vs Black Goat
Black Goat generates a lot of units through Fertility and can build a massive board presence. However, their combat is not as strong as yours. Use Absorb to crack through walls of Dark Young and Fungi. Black Goat wants to be left alone to accumulate doom -- do not let them. Punish overextension with Submerge strikes.

### vs Crawling Chaos
Your most fraught matchup. Madness is devastating against you because it denies you control of your pain retreats. Try to form an early alliance -- even suggest both going greedy with double gates on Turn 1. If Crawling Chaos is hostile, you need to eliminate their presence near your ocean areas or accept that your Submerge plays will be much riskier. Flight can also be annoying, letting Nyarlathotep escape fights you set up.

### vs Yellow Sign
Yellow Sign can build a big doom lead through Desecration and passive scoring. You are the natural check to Yellow Sign -- submerge into their territory and smash their stacks. Even a King in Yellow plus Hastur formation crumbles against a well-executed Absorb ball rolling 20+ dice. Do not let them sit undisturbed.

### vs Opener of the Way
Opener lacks raw combat dice and relies on gate manipulation. Beyond One can remove your South Pacific gate, which is extremely disruptive. If Opener is friendly, they can move gates into the ocean to feed Y'ha-nthlei. If hostile, they can make your life miserable. Be wary of Yog-Sothoth's combat ability and prioritize protecting South Pacific.

### vs Sleeper
Sleeper turtles in the early game, stacking units and waiting. Their "everyone loses 1 Power" ability can knock you below the 10 Power threshold for awakening Cthulhu on Turn 2. Sleeper's late-game burst is strong, but they are vulnerable to early Absorb plays that crack their defensive stack before they come online. Hit them early if you can.

### vs Windwalker
Windwalker is another aggressive combat faction that can rival your dice output. Ithaqua hits hard and Gnoph-Keh grow stronger in groups. Avoid fighting Windwalker at full strength in areas where they have multiple Gnoph-Keh. Instead, use Submerge to strike where they are weak. You both benefit from fighting other people, so an alliance of convenience can work.

### vs Tcho-Tcho
Tcho-Tcho left unchecked will absolutely run away with the game through proto-Shoggoth and Terror scoring. You are the best faction at policing them. Submerge into their territory and use Absorb to shatter their turtled-up positions. They want to be left alone -- make sure that does not happen.

### vs Ancients
The Ancients play a defensive, area-denial game. Their combat is solid but not overwhelming. Use Submerge to bypass their controlled territories and strike at poorly defended gates. Absorb lets you match their defensive formations with overwhelming dice. Avoid prolonged attrition wars in their home turf.

### vs Daemon Sultan
Daemon Sultan can create chaos gates and has unpredictable scoring. If they place chaos gates in ocean areas, Y'ha-nthlei benefits you. Their combat is inconsistent, so you generally have the edge in direct fights. Watch for their doom-rush potential and police them if they start pulling ahead.

### vs Bubastis
Bubastis relies on cat-like mobility and indirect strategies. They are not a major combat threat compared to you, so you can pressure them relatively safely. Use Submerge to keep them off balance and deny them the space to execute their plans. They often want to avoid you -- use that fear as leverage for political deals.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not taking Submerge first.** When you awaken Cthulhu, take Submerge. Period. Do not get clever. Players who skip Submerge regret it immediately.

2. **Depleting your pool.** If all 4 Deep Ones are on the map, you cannot Devolve. If all 6 Acolytes are on the map, you cannot Dreams. Always keep reserves in your pool. The rain cycle only works if units are flowing back.

3. **Leaving units stranded on land.** Deep Ones stuck on land with no gate are dead weight. Get them back to ocean areas as fast as possible so Submerge can collect them.

4. **Making Immortal cycling your main strategy.** Re-awakening Cthulhu for Elder Signs is a great finisher, but 4 Power for an average of 1.67 doom is not efficient enough to be your primary plan. Fight, control gates, and score doom the normal way. Use Immortal to close out, not as your engine.

5. **Fighting without purpose.** Every battle should have a concrete goal: earn a spellbook, take a gate, kill a key unit, or police the leader. Random fights that cost you Power for no strategic gain are wasteful.

6. **Ignoring the South Pacific gate.** If that gate disappears and Cthulhu dies, you are in serious trouble. Protect it. Devolve an Acolyte there if threatened.

7. **Overextending to 4-5 gates.** Three well-defended gates (12+ Power) is better than five thinly spread ones. Overextending invites Dreams from an opposing Cthulhu player in a mirror or just mass capture from aggressive opponents.

8. **Taking Absorb without a Shoggoth.** Do not pick Absorb as a spellbook if you have no Shoggoths in play and no plans to summon one soon. Pick a book that matches what you actually have on the board.

## Tips & Tricks

- **The submerge stall is your secret weapon.** Submerge for 1, unsubmerge for 0, repeat. You spend Power at half the rate of opponents. Against less experienced players, this alone can win you the game by letting you outlast everyone and then steal gates or fight when nobody can respond.

- **Aim for 3 kills/devours in one battle** to earn both combat spellbooks simultaneously. Cthulhu Devours one unit pre-battle, then you need to roll 2 kills. This is the most Power-efficient path to getting online.

- **The Absorb ball can roll over 20 dice regularly** while maintaining other gates on the map. The theoretical maximum (eating all 10 possible units) is 38 dice, but 20-25 is the practical sweet spot for overwhelming any defense.

- **Pains are free movement.** When Crawling Chaos is not in the game (or is your ally), choose to pain your units into adjacent areas where you want them next. With unlimited combat, you can fight in one area, get pained to another, and immediately declare battle there. Chain 2-3 fights in a single turn.

- **Counter-play awareness:** When playing against Cthulhu, never build gates in the ocean (it powers Y'ha-nthlei), keep 2 Acolytes on every gate (to make Dreams expensive), and move your units away when Cthulhu unsubmerges to deny kill/devour spellbook requirements.

- **The rain cycle is like water cycling.** Absorb eats your units (they return to pool), Devolve transforms Acolytes into Deep Ones for defense (Deep Ones come from pool), Dreams steals gates using Acolytes from your pool. Master this loop and you will never run out of options.

- **When building your third ocean gate,** take Devolve if it is your first spellbook. You can immediately Devolve to protect the undefended gate rather than spending Power on a monster.

- **Sending Cthulhu to his death deliberately is a valid late-game tactic.** Dying once or twice per action phase to collect Elder Signs via Immortal can close out tight games -- just make sure you have the 4 Power per re-awakening budgeted. (Sandy Petersen)

- **Cthulhu cannot be strong everywhere at once.** Sandy Petersen designed the faction so that while Cthulhu's main force is unstoppable, he has fewer monsters than other factions, making him easy to weaken by picking off stragglers at the edges. Protect your flanks or accept that some gates will be vulnerable. (Sandy Petersen)

- **Regenerate makes a Starspawn pair nearly invincible.** It takes a minimum of three kill results to eliminate a single Starspawn with Regenerate active. Two Starspawn plus Cthulhu creates a compact strike force that is extremely hard to crack without committing an overwhelming force. (community insight)

## Frequently Asked Questions

*Common rules questions specific to Great Cthulhu. Sourced from the [official Petersen Games FAQ](https://petersengames.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48000952254) and community rulings.*

### Can Devour target Terrors or other special tokens?

No. Devour targets enemy monsters or Cultists present in the battle area. Terrors are immune to spellbook abilities that target monsters, so they cannot be Devoured. Devour also cannot target Great Old Ones -- it specifically eliminates a monster or Cultist of the enemy's choice.

### When exactly does Devour trigger in combat?

Devour is a pre-battle ability, meaning it resolves before any combat dice are rolled. The defending player must choose and eliminate one of their own monsters or Cultists from the battle area before the fight begins. This removal counts toward your kill/devour spellbook requirements.

### Can Submerge be used if Cthulhu is in a land area?

No. Cthulhu must be in an ocean or sea area to initiate the Submerge action. You cannot Submerge from a landlocked area. This is why it is critical to always retreat pained units back toward ocean areas when possible -- stranded units on land cannot be picked up by Submerge.

### Does Devolve trigger during another player's action?

Yes. Devolve is one of the only "instant speed" abilities in Cthulhu Wars. At the end of any player's action -- even if it is not your turn -- you may transform one or more of your Acolytes anywhere on the map into Deep Ones. This makes your gates extremely difficult to capture, since you can respond immediately when an opponent moves into your gate's area.

### Can Dreams target an area where a Great Old One is protecting the Cultist?

Yes. Dreams is not a capture action -- it forces the enemy to eliminate one of their Acolytes and replaces it with one of yours. The presence of a Great Old One or monsters does not prevent Dreams from working. However, the enemy chooses which Acolyte to eliminate if they have more than one in the area.

### What happens if all Deep Ones are already on the map when I want to Devolve?

You cannot Devolve. Devolve transforms Acolytes into Deep Ones from your unit pool. If all four Deep Ones are already deployed on the map, there are none available to place, so the ability simply cannot be used. This is why experienced players always keep at least one or two Deep Ones in reserve.

### Does Immortal trigger if Cthulhu is eliminated rather than killed?

Yes. Immortal triggers any time Cthulhu is removed from the map and subsequently re-awakened. Whether he was killed in battle, eliminated by an ability, or removed by any other effect, you gain an Elder Sign each time you pay the 4-Power re-awakening cost. The Elder Sign is tied to the act of awakening, not the method of removal.

### Can you use Absorb to sacrifice units from a faction that has no units in the battle?

No. Absorb lets you eliminate your own monsters or Cultists that are present in the battle area to add dice to your Shoggoth. You can only sacrifice your own units, and they must be in the same area where the battle is taking place. You cannot sacrifice units belonging to other factions, and you cannot sacrifice units from other areas.

### Does Y'ha-nthlei count gates controlled by allies or only enemies?

Y'ha-nthlei grants 1 Power for each enemy-controlled gate in an ocean area during Gather Power. Allied gates still count as "enemy-controlled" for this purpose -- in Cthulhu Wars, every other player is technically an enemy regardless of any informal alliances. However, experienced opponents will avoid building gates in the ocean specifically to deny you this bonus.
