# Bubastis

## Overview

Bubastis is one of the most unusual factions in all of Cthulhu Wars. Born from an April Fool's joke that became reality during Onslaught 4, this faction draws on the Lovecraftian tradition of cosmic cats -- most notably from *The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath* and Robert Bloch's *The Cult of Bubastis*. What you get is a collection of felines from across the solar system: Earth cats, cats from Mars, cats from Saturn, cats from Uranus, and the Elder God Bastet herself. Bubastis does not play by the same rules as any other faction. It has no Cultists, cannot control Gates (except its permanent one on the Moon), and cannot perform standard Rituals of Annihilation. Instead, it is a doom engine that accumulates points through its unique abilities -- Ailurophobia and Requires Attention -- while using the Moon as a staging ground and highway to every corner of the map. Think of Bubastis as a clock on the game: if left unchecked, it will win before anyone else crosses 30 doom. Understanding how the cats work is essential not just for the Bubastis player, but for everyone at the table.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

Bubastis is a doom-focused engine faction, comparable in spirit to how Tcho-Tcho or Yellow Sign build toward explosive scoring turns, but the cats approach it from a completely alien angle. They have no acolytes, no Gate control, and no traditional ritual. Every single unit on their roster is a monster (or an Elder God), which means every unit generates Power during Gather Power and every unit can capture enemy Cultists.

The faction's identity revolves around the prisoner's dilemma it forces onto the table. If all other players cooperate to police the cats, Bubastis stays manageable. If even one player decides to race ahead and ignore the cats, Bubastis can run away with the game. This dynamic is very similar to the Vagabond in Root -- a single entity that acts as a game clock requiring collective attention.

The Bubastis player's job is straightforward in concept but tricky in execution: maintain your cat count (since cats equal Power), position your cat varieties to maximize Ailurophobia doom, and get Bastet into the right spot to fire off Requires Attention for explosive doom plus Elder Signs. You are not fighting for Gates. You are not building an economy the traditional way. You are exploiting adjacency, timing, and the threat of Catnapping to control the tempo of the entire game.

**Setup:** Start with 8 Power. Place the Moon tile within reach. Place 6 Earth Cats on the Moon. In games using High Priests, Bubastis gains 1 extra Power each Gather Power phase.

**Unique Faction Ability -- Lunacy (Ongoing):** Spellbooks and abilities that affect Cultists can target Earth Cats as if they are acolytes. Earth Cats cannot be captured as Cultists, nor can they create or control Gates. This ability is not optional. Lunacy is more of a vulnerability than a boon -- it means abilities like Dreams, Zingaya, and Groth can all target your Earth Cats. Keep this in mind both as the cat player and when playing against them.

## Spellbook Abilities

### Catnapping
**Unlock condition:** Awaken Bastet
**Effect:** Action (cost 1 Power). Choose any or all enemy factions in Bastet's area. Move all units belonging to those factions from that area to the Moon. When a unit on the Moon leaves, you gain Power equal to what they spent on movement.
**Strategic notes:** Catnapping is one of the most powerful abilities in all of Cthulhu Wars. Target big clumps of units that don't roll many combat dice -- a cluster of Crawling Chaos acolytes with a Nightgaunt, or early-game Tcho-Tcho with several acolytes and a Proto-Shoggoth. Avoid sending two combat-heavy armies to the Moon together, because they will just fight each other, pain themselves off the Moon, and deny you the Power you would have earned from their movement. Be mindful of table politics: everyone you Catnap will be furious, and the Moon is adjacent to everything, so they can easily come after you. Use table talk to steer catnapped players toward other targets.

### Catabolism
**Unlock condition:** As an action, pay 2 Power
**Effect:** Ongoing. Earth Cats can recruit monsters as if the monsters were Cultists, instead of needing to summon them.
**Strategic notes:** Without Catabolism, you can only summon cats on the Moon (your only controlled Gate), then spend additional Power moving them to the map. With this spellbook, you can recruit cat varieties directly next to any Earth Cat already on the board, saving you significant Power over the course of the game. Take this as one of your first spellbooks -- the Power efficiency it provides compounds over multiple turns and gives you much more flexible positioning.

### Zagazig
**Unlock condition:** A Cat from Mars or a Cat from Saturn is killed or eliminated
**Effect:** Pre-battle ability. If a Cat from Mars is in the battle, all rolled pains become kills and all rolled kills become pains (for both sides).
**Strategic notes:** The standard Cthulhu Wars combat die has 3 blanks, 2 pains, and 1 kill. Zagazig flips pains and kills, giving everyone in the battle a 1-in-3 chance of rolling a kill instead of 1-in-6. This is a massive upgrade to lethality. It helps you earn your spellbook requirements (since you need cats to die) and lets you punch well above your weight in combat. The downside is symmetrical -- your opponent also rolls more kills -- so plan accordingly. Pair with Savagery for devastating results.

### Savagery
**Unlock condition:** No Earth Cats on the Moon
**Effect:** Pre-battle ability. Pay 1 Power to increase the combat of all Cats from Saturn by 4 for this battle.
**Strategic notes:** Cats from Saturn normally roll 2 dice. With Savagery, they roll 6 dice each for just 1 Power. Combined with Zagazig, you are rolling a huge number of dice with a doubled kill rate. If you have both Cats from Saturn in a single battle with Savagery active, that is 12 dice from them alone. This is how cats compete in straight-up fights with the heaviest combat factions in the game.

### Predator
**Unlock condition:** A Cat from Uranus is killed or eliminated
**Effect:** Post-battle ability. If a Cat from Uranus was in the battle, select one unit killed by the enemy. They must eliminate a second unit of that type from anywhere on the map, if possible.
**Strategic notes:** Predator turns every battle involving a Cat from Uranus into a potential extinction event for your opponent's key monsters. If you kill a Formless Spawn, a Spawn of Yog, or a specific Daemon Sultan larva type, you get to snipe another one of that same unit from anywhere on the map for free. Hunt endangered species -- target expensive monsters that your opponent only has a few of. This ability has enormous swing potential in the mid and late game.

### Ailurophobia
**Unlock condition:** A cat is in every enemy faction's starting area (gain 1 Power per enemy faction when earned)
**Effect:** Doom phase ability. Gain 1 doom per monster cat variety sharing a non-Moon area with units from enemy factions.
**Strategic notes:** You have four cat varieties (Earth, Mars, Saturn, Uranus), so Ailurophobia can generate up to 4 doom per doom phase with relatively little effort. Think of each cat variety sitting in an enemy-occupied area as equivalent to controlling a Gate. Combined with the Moon Gate (1 doom) and Requires Attention (4+ doom), this is how you build your doom total turn over turn. Position your cats at the end of each action phase to maximize Ailurophobia, then pull them to safety early in the next action phase. Note: the printed card has a known misprint omitting "non-Moon area," but this has been officially clarified. Ailurophobia only counts non-Moon areas.

## Units

### Earth Cats
| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | 1 Power |
| **Combat** | 0 |
| **Count** | 6 |
| **Type** | Monster |

Earth Cats are your cheapest units and the backbone of your Power economy. Each one generates 1 Power during Gather Power, same as every other cat. They cannot roll combat dice, but they are monsters -- meaning they can capture enemy Cultists, which is a huge deal in the early game. All 6 start on the Moon, which is adjacent to every map area, so they threaten captures from turn one. Thanks to Lunacy, Earth Cats can be targeted by abilities that affect Cultists (Zingaya, Dreams, etc.), making them your most vulnerable unit type. When not needed for captures or Ailurophobia positioning, park Earth Cats in unoccupied areas where enemies cannot easily kill them.

### Cats from Mars
| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | 2 Power |
| **Combat** | 1 |
| **Count** | 2 |
| **Type** | Monster |

Your cheapest combat-capable unit. Cats from Mars are essential for activating Zagazig, which transforms every battle into a far more lethal affair. At only 2 Power to summon, losing one to earn the Zagazig spellbook requirement is a reasonable investment. They generate 1 Power during Gather Power like all cats. In combat, a single die is not impressive on its own, but with Zagazig active, even one die has a 1-in-3 chance of producing a kill.

### Cats from Saturn
| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | 3 Power |
| **Combat** | 2 |
| **Count** | 2 |
| **Type** | Monster |

The mid-range combat cats. Rolling 2 dice base is respectable, but the real value comes from Savagery: pay 1 Power before battle and each Cat from Saturn rolls 6 dice instead. That is an extraordinary Power-to-dice ratio. Cats from Saturn are your primary damage dealers in any serious fight. Keep them alive when you can, and commit them to battle when you have Zagazig and Savagery online for maximum devastation.

### Cats from Uranus
| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | 4 Power |
| **Combat** | 3 |
| **Count** | 2 |
| **Type** | Monster |

The most expensive monsters in the Bubastis roster and among the priciest monsters in the entire game. Three combat dice is strong baseline, and Predator makes every battle featuring a Cat from Uranus potentially catastrophic for your opponent. The spellbook requirement to lose one can be tricky -- savvy opponents will avoid fighting your Cats from Uranus specifically to deny you that spellbook. Losing a 4-Power unit also hurts your economy, so plan your sacrifice carefully. Once you have the Predator spellbook, these cats become your big-game hunters.

### Bastet (Elder God)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | 6 Power |
| **Combat** | Special (see below) |
| **Count** | 1 |
| **Type** | Elder God |

Bastet is an Elder God, not a Great Old One. Elder Gods are treated as Great Old Ones for most purposes (blocking captures, counting for Harbinger, etc.) but with key differences: they never roll combat dice and cannot declare battles. They also do not inherently provide an Elder Sign when performing a Ritual of Annihilation. Instead, Bastet's combat benefit is fixed: add 1 kill to your combat total and the enemy must lower their kill total by 1. This makes Bastet surprisingly durable in defensive fights -- an opponent sending a single Great Old One against Bastet alone will lose that unit.

**Awakening Requirements:** All cat varieties must be in play (minimum 7 Power invested across Mars, Saturn, and Uranus cats plus Earth Cats). Pay 6 Power. Place Bastet in an area containing no enemy units. Expect to awaken Bastet in Action Phase 2 at the earliest, with Action Phase 3 being more typical.

**Requires Attention (Doom Phase):** If Bastet is in an area containing an enemy Cultist, you may perform a Ritual of Annihilation. This grants exactly 4 doom, plus 1 Elder Sign if Bastet's area has an enemy-controlled Gate, plus 2 Elder Signs if Bastet's area has an enemy Great Old One. These bonuses are additive. At maximum, a single Requires Attention can yield 4 doom plus 3 Elder Signs -- effectively close to 10 doom equivalent. This is the win condition for the entire faction. If you fire this twice with Elder Signs attached, the game is essentially over.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

The cats have a spectrum of openings depending on how opponents react. Here are the two main lines and the optimal greedy middle ground.

### Turn 1 (Action Phase 1)
You start with 8 Power and 6 Earth Cats on the Moon (adjacent to everything). Your two priorities are moving Earth Cats to the map and summoning off-world cat varieties. Stagger your Earth Cat movements -- move one per action rather than dumping several at once. This lets you react to what opponents do and maintain threat across more turns. If opponents are not moving monsters before building Gates, punish them by placing Earth Cats next to exposed Cultists for captures. If opponents are playing safely and escorting Cultists with monsters, pivot toward summoning a Cat from Mars (2 Power) or Cat from Saturn (3 Power) on the Moon to start building toward Bastet's awakening requirements.

### Turn 2 (Action Phase 2)
If you went heavy on Earth Cat movement in Turn 1, you should have most or all of them off the Moon. Use this turn to summon the remaining cat varieties you need. If you went the summoning route in Turn 1, finish moving Earth Cats off the Moon and fill in any missing cat varieties. Your goal by the end of Turn 2 is to have all cat varieties in play so you can awaken Bastet. If the board state allows it, an Action Phase 2 awakening is possible but aggressive. More commonly, you will be setting up for Turn 3.

### Turn 3 (Action Phase 3)
Awaken Bastet if you have not already. You need all cat varieties in play, 6 Power, and an area with no enemy units. After awakening, you still want Power left over to begin Catnapping and positioning cats for Ailurophobia. From this point forward, the game shifts into your doom engine phase.

**The Greedy Opening (4-player game):** Spend 6 Power moving all Earth Cats off the Moon, placing 3 into enemy starting areas (earning the spellbook requirement and gaining Power back). With your remaining 5 Power, summon a Cat from Saturn (3) and a Cat from Mars (2). Next turn you will have enough for a Cat from Uranus (4) and Bastet (6). The risk is that this only works if nobody kills your cats -- once players learn to police the cats, you will need to be more conservative and accept a slower build.

## Early Game (Turns 1-3)

The early game is all about establishing your presence on the map and earning spellbooks as efficiently as possible. Your cats create a new rule layer for the entire table, similar to how Crawling Chaos and Madness warp the opening. The implicit message to all players is: you cannot safely send a lone Cultist to build a Gate anymore, because an Earth Cat can drop in from the Moon and force a capture. The only faction immune to this threat is Black Goat, which can build a Gate and immediately summon a monster via Fertility Cult before the cats get a turn.

Prioritize Catabolism early so you can recruit cats directly on the map instead of always summoning on the Moon and paying to move. The "pay 2 Power" spellbook requirement is flexible -- do not rush it if you have better uses for your Power on Turn 1. Getting all Earth Cats off the Moon and into enemy starting areas earns you a spellbook and Power, so weave that in naturally across your early actions.

## Mid Game (Turns 4-5)

By the mid game, Bastet should be awake and you should have most or all of your spellbooks. This is when the doom engine kicks into gear. Your priorities shift to:

1. **Positioning for Ailurophobia:** At the end of each action phase, have as many cat varieties as possible sharing areas with enemy units (not on the Moon). Each variety in an enemy-occupied area is 1 doom.

2. **Setting up Requires Attention:** Get Bastet into an area with an enemy Cultist, ideally also containing an enemy Gate and/or an enemy Great Old One for the Elder Sign bonuses. This requires careful timing -- move Bastet into position late in the action phase so opponents have limited chances to react.

3. **Catnapping for Power:** Use Catnapping to send enemy armies to the Moon, generating Power as they move off. Target clumps of low-combat units for maximum Power gain.

4. **Preserving your cat count:** Every cat that dies reduces your Power income. After earning your kill-based spellbook requirements, shift to a preservation mindset. Hide Earth Cats in unoccupied areas. Keep combat cats together where they can leverage Zagazig, Savagery, and Predator if attacked.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

In the late game, you are looking to fire Requires Attention one or two more times to close out the game. A single Requires Attention with full Elder Sign bonuses (area with enemy Cultist + enemy Gate + enemy Great Old One) generates approximately 10 doom equivalent. Two such triggers will end the game outright, even if you started the late game behind.

Ritual costs escalate as the game progresses, so do not let yourself get drained. If you started a doom phase with only 11 Power and the ritual costs 8, you will have almost nothing left to work with. Keep your cat count high and use Catnapping to supplement your Power.

At this stage, the other players should be forming what the podcast calls a "kitty committee" -- a social contract to collectively police the cats. If they are not coordinating, you win. If they are, you need to play more carefully, using the Moon's universal adjacency to dodge threats and sneak cats into scoring positions at the last possible moment.

## Power Combos & Synergies

**Zagazig + Savagery + Predator (The Full Cat Battle):** Bring a Cat from Mars, a Cat from Saturn, and a Cat from Uranus into a single battle. Pay 1 for Savagery. You are now rolling 10 dice (1 from Mars + 6 from boosted Saturn + 3 from Uranus) with Zagazig converting pains to kills. After the battle, Predator lets you snipe another copy of a killed enemy unit from anywhere on the map. Add Bastet for a guaranteed kill and damage reduction. This is one of the deadliest combat setups in the game.

**Catnapping + Moon Adjacency:** Catnap enemies to the Moon, then exploit the fact that the Moon is adjacent to everything. Enemies on the Moon must spend Power to move off (generating Power for you), and they might fight each other on the Moon (saving you the trouble). Meanwhile, the area you just cleared of enemies is now open for Ailurophobia positioning or Bastet's Requires Attention.

**Ailurophobia + Requires Attention + Moon Gate:** In a single doom phase, you can potentially earn 1 doom from the Moon Gate, up to 4 doom from Ailurophobia, and 4 doom plus 3 Elder Signs from Requires Attention. That is a theoretical ceiling of approximately 15 doom in one turn, which is game-ending.

**Catabolism + Earth Cat Positioning:** Recruit off-world cats directly next to Earth Cats already on the map, bypassing the Moon entirely. This saves you movement Power and lets you respond to board state in real time rather than pre-positioning cats on the Moon.

## Factions to Watch Out For

**Sleeper** is arguably the hardest counter to Bubastis. Capture Monster can devastate your cat varieties without even requiring combat, and Lethargy can lock your cats in place. As long as Bastet is not present to block captures, the Sleeper can systematically strip away your expensive off-world cats.

**Yellow Sign** might seem weak against cats due to low combat dice, but Zingaya targets Cultists -- and thanks to Lunacy, Earth Cats count. Yellow Sign can convert your Earth Cats into Undead cheaply and efficiently, reducing your Power income and forcing expensive re-summons.

**Any faction with strong combat dice** (Great Cthulhu, Windwalker) can proactively hunt your cats to reduce your Power and deny Ailurophobia doom. The key for opponents is cooperation: if only one player is fighting the cats, they fall behind while everyone else benefits. All non-cat players need to pitch in.

## Matchups

### vs Great Cthulhu
Cthulhu's combat prowess means they can hunt your cats effectively, and Devolve makes losing monsters sting even more. However, Cthulhu's armies tend to clump around Gates, making them prime Catnapping targets. Avoid leaving cats near Cthulhu death balls and use Catnapping to scatter his forces when they stack up.

### vs Black Goat
Black Goat is the one faction that can safely ignore your early Earth Cat capture threat thanks to Fertility Cult, which lets them summon a monster immediately after building a Gate. Their swarm of cheap units can be irritating to deal with, but those same swarms make great Catnapping targets. Keep your distance from Shub-Niggurath.

### vs Crawling Chaos
Crawling Chaos acolyte clusters with Nightgaunts are ideal Catnapping targets -- lots of units, not many combat dice. However, Madness adds another layer of disruption you need to track. Nyarlathotep's mobility makes it hard to pin down, but he is also unlikely to kill Bastet alone thanks to her damage reduction.

### vs Yellow Sign
Yellow Sign's low combat makes it hard for them to clear cats from their areas, but Zingaya is a serious threat to your Earth Cats via the Lunacy ability. The Desecration doom engine can keep pace with yours, making this a race. Watch for Zingaya targeting and protect your Earth Cats accordingly.

### vs Opener of the Way
Yog-Sothoth's ability to move Gates around the map and his faction's general flexibility make them unpredictable neighbors. They have decent combat and can threaten your cats. The Moon being a controlled Gate is notable -- some interactions with Gate-moving abilities may apply. Keep your cats mobile and avoid getting caught by concentrated Opener forces.

### vs Sleeper
This is your worst matchup. Capture Monster can eliminate your off-world cats without combat, Lethargy can lock down your positioning, and Tsathoggua's presence makes areas dangerous to approach. Prioritize keeping Bastet near your valuable cats to block captures. If Sleeper is in the game, your cat preservation game must be flawless.

### vs Windwalker
Windwalker has strong combat and Ithaqua's mobility via Arctic Wind can bring concentrated force to bear quickly. They are good at hunting your cats, but you can use Catnapping to disrupt their positioning. Rhan-Tegoth being in unexpected places can be a threat. Fight defensively and use Zagazig plus Savagery to make any attack on you costly.

### vs Tcho-Tcho
Early-game Tcho-Tcho with several acolytes and a Proto-Shoggoth make excellent Catnapping targets. Their Martyrdom economy means they actively want units to die, but being sent to the Moon disrupts their tempo without triggering Martyrdom benefits. Tcho-Tcho also accelerate ritual costs, so be aware of how quickly rituals become expensive.

### vs Ancients
The Ancients are another strong engine faction that can race your doom total. Their ability to ramp up quickly means the game may end before you have time to fire Requires Attention multiple times. This matchup is a tempo race -- get your engine online fast and do not let the Ancients out-doom you unchallenged.

### vs Daemon Sultan
Daemon Sultan has its own unusual mechanics and can generate doom in non-traditional ways. Both factions warp the game around them, so when they appear together, the table has two clocks to manage simultaneously. Coordinate with other players if you can, or accept that the game will be chaotic. Watch for Daemon Sultan's larvae -- Predator can be effective at eliminating specific larva types.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Dumping all Earth Cats off the Moon at once.** Stagger your Earth Cat movements one per action. Moving 3-4 cats in a single action wastes your tempo and gives opponents too much information about your plans.

2. **Neglecting cat preservation after earning kill-based spellbooks.** Once you have Zagazig, Predator, and the Uranus kill spellbook, shift to keeping cats alive. Every dead cat is 1 less Power per turn.

3. **Putting two combat-heavy enemy armies on the Moon together via Catnapping.** They will fight each other, pain themselves off the Moon, and you get zero Power for it. Target low-combat clumps instead.

4. **Ignoring ritual cost escalation.** Requires Attention is your ritual, and it gets more expensive as other factions perform rituals. Do not wait too long to fire it, and make sure you have enough Power when the time comes.

5. **Leaving Bastet exposed during the action phase.** Bastet only needs to be in a dangerous position at the end of the action phase for Requires Attention. During the action phase, keep her safe. Getting Bastet killed costs you 6 Power to re-awaken and loses your Requires Attention for a full turn.

6. **Forgetting that Earth Cats can be targeted by Cultist-affecting abilities.** Lunacy is a real vulnerability. Zingaya, Dreams, and Groth can all hit your Earth Cats. Do not assume they are safe just because they are monsters.

7. **Not earning the Cat from Uranus spellbook early enough.** This is consistently the last spellbook players struggle to earn. Savvy opponents will avoid fighting your Uranus cats to deny you the spellbook. Actively engineer a battle where one will die -- do not wait for it to happen on its own.

## Tips & Tricks from the Podcast

- **The Moon is adjacent to everything.** This cannot be overstated. You can reach any area in one move from the Moon, and this is what makes Earth Cat captures so threatening in the early game. Use the Moon as a highway.

- **Other factions can move off the Moon but not to it.** When you Catnap enemies to the Moon, they can leave, but they cannot return voluntarily. This is a one-way trip that disrupts their positioning and costs them Power (which you gain).

- **Form a "kitty committee."** When playing against Bubastis, all non-cat players should agree to collectively police the cats. Everyone watches for Ailurophobia positioning and Requires Attention setups during the doom phase. If one player defects from the committee and stops punching cats, that player should not be trusted or assisted.

- **Pain yourselves off the Moon.** If you get Catnapped to the Moon with another faction, fight each other and use pains to leave. This denies the cat player the Power they would earn from your movement.

- **Target Cats from Uranus.** After the cat player has already earned their kill-based spellbooks, prioritize killing Cats from Uranus. At 4 Power each, they are the most expensive to re-summon, and every Power the cat player spends resummoning is Power they cannot spend elsewhere.

- **Killing Bastet is always worth it.** If you have the opportunity to kill Bastet, take it. Denying Requires Attention for even one turn can be the difference between the cats winning and losing. Everyone at the table needs to be on the same page about this.

- **The cats can actually fight.** With all cat varieties in a single battle, Savagery active, and Zagazig flipping pains to kills, the cats roll 10+ dice with a doubled kill rate. Do not underestimate their combat potential just because they are a doom engine faction.

- **Black Goat is immune to early Earth Cat captures** thanks to Fertility Cult allowing immediate monster summons after Gate building. Every other faction needs to escort Cultists with monsters from Turn 1 when cats are in the game.

- **Consider the "Noobastis" variant.** If your group finds Bubastis too oppressive, try removing Ailurophobia and Catabolism and replacing them with Syzygy (gain an Elder Sign during the doom phase if you have no units on the Moon) and Carnivore (post-battle, gain 1 doom for every unit killed or eliminated in the battle). This variant makes the cats more interactive, more fragile, and less engine-dependent. It is the default version played on Tabletop Simulator.
