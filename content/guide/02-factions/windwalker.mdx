# Windwalker

## Overview

Windwalker is an expansion faction that combines two Great Old Ones -- Ithaqua and Rhan-Tegoth -- into one of the most powerful and flexible factions in the entire game. Drawing from both August Derleth's "The Thing That Walked on the Wind" (Ithaqua) and the Lovecraft/Hazel Heald collaboration "The Horror in the Museum" (Rhan-Tegoth), this faction unites the cold, desolate corners of the world under a single terrifying banner.

- **Difficulty:** Beginner-friendly but with a very high skill ceiling. The straightforward mechanics make it approachable for new players, but an experienced pilot can make this faction absolutely devastating.
- **Starting Setup:** 8 Power, 6 Acolytes, one controlled Gate on either the North Pole or South Pole (your choice of Windwalker glyph area). You set up after everyone except Opener of the Way.
- **Unique Faction Ability:** Hibernate -- a zero-cost action that lets you bank unspent Power into the next turn, plus gain bonus Power for each enemy Great Old One in play (capped at your current Power). You take no further actions this phase.
- **Playstyle:** Patient accumulator and explosive striker. Build up Power through repeated hibernation, then unleash a devastating turn where you march your death ball across the map, claim Gates, and earn multiple Spellbooks in a single action phase.

When played correctly, Windwalker is arguably the number one or number two faction in the game, easily in the top three. It can pivot between an aggressive, combat-heavy playstyle rivaling Great Cthulhu and Crawling Chaos, or a more defensive, ritual-centric approach -- and the best Windwalker players blend both styles to keep opponents guessing.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

Windwalker is the hibernating predator of Cthulhu Wars. Think of it like a grizzly bear deciding to sleep through the winter -- you really do not want to be nearby when it finally wakes up and starts doing things.

**Core Strengths:**
- Hibernate generates more Power than any other faction in the game, routinely reaching 20+ Power and occasionally hitting 30 on larger maps
- Two Great Old Ones provide enormous combat dice and board presence
- Ice Age token acts as a virtual 0.5 Great Old One, taxing opponents for every action in its area
- Arctic Wind enables one of the scariest death balls in the game, moving your entire army for a single Power
- Herald of the Outer Gods locks your ritual cost at 5 Power regardless of the ritual track, enabling consistent 6+ doom per turn on just two Gates
- Ferox makes your Cultists immune to monster capture, forcing opponents to commit their Great Old Ones to steal your Gates
- Cannibalism provides free unit replacement after every battle where you score kills
- Three free Elder Signs from the final Spellbook requirement translate to roughly five doom on average for zero effort

**Core Weaknesses:**
- Doom tempo is extremely slow in the early game -- you may be earning just one doom per turn for the first few action phases while hibernating
- Ithaqua replaces a Gate when awakened, temporarily reducing your economy
- If Ithaqua is killed and no Gates exist on either pole, re-awakening becomes very difficult
- Gnoph-Keh are expensive to summon initially (first one costs 4 Power)
- Opponents who coordinate early disruption can prevent the big hibernation payoff
- The faction requires patience and good timing -- hibernating too long means you may never catch up in doom

**Key Philosophy:** You are a slow-building avalanche. Spend the early game stockpiling Power through hibernation while your opponents exhaust themselves with their own priorities. When you finally move, you should have overwhelming force, multiple objectives to accomplish, and the Power to do it all in one explosive turn. Then hibernate again and repeat.

## Spellbook Abilities

### Ice Age
**Unlock condition:** One of six available Spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** 1-cost action. Place or move your Ice Age token into any area. When an enemy faction takes any action ending in the Ice Age area, they must pay 1 additional Power.
**Strategic notes:** This is one of the best Spellbooks in the entire game, and you should take it early. The Ice Age token is so strong it functions like half a Great Old One -- you can effectively consider Windwalker as having 2.5 Great Old Ones on the board. Use it defensively on one of your Gates to make attacking you prohibitively expensive: an opponent trying to steal a Gate with two Acolytes and Ice Age needs to spend 2 Power just to move in, then additional Power for captures or battles, easily totaling 4+ Power for a single Gate. That is enough to deter most opportunistic attacks. You can also use it offensively -- drop it on an area where an opponent plans to awaken their Great Old One to make it more expensive, or place it on a contested Gate to grief a specific player. There is also a strong diplomacy angle: offer to Ice Age an ally's Gate to protect it from other players in exchange for leaving you alone. The FAQ for this Spellbook is lengthy; the key rule is that actions must end in the area to be taxed (so Submerge out of an Ice Age area is free, but re-emerging into one costs extra).

### Arctic Wind
**Unlock condition:** One of six available Spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Ongoing. When Ithaqua uses the move action, any or all of your units in the same area can move with Ithaqua for no additional cost.
**Strategic notes:** This is the engine that makes the Windwalker death ball possible, and it is among the strongest movement abilities in the game. For a single Power, you can move Ithaqua and your entire army -- Rhan-Tegoth, all four Gnoph-Keh, Wendigos, Acolytes, everything -- into an adjacent area. Take this Spellbook immediately when you awaken Ithaqua. Never let Ithaqua walk alone, because it is easily killed in isolation. The power of Arctic Wind is that your big explosive turns become incredibly efficient: march your consolidated death ball across the map, smashing through under-defended Gates, capturing Cultists, and building a Gate on the opposite pole, all while spending minimal Power on movement. One Power per area of movement for your entire army is an absurd value proposition.

### Cannibalism
**Unlock condition:** One of six available Spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Post-battle. After all battle results have been applied, if one or more enemy units were killed, you may place a Wendigo or Acolyte from your pool into the battle area. You may do this even if you are not involved in the battle.
**Strategic notes:** This is an extremely strong Spellbook that fundamentally changes how you approach combat. Throw your Acolytes and Wendigos under the bus as expendable casualties in every big fight, because as long as you kill at least one enemy unit (which you almost certainly will with this faction's dice output), you immediately replace what you lost. The best-case scenario is fighting at a Gate you want to claim: you kill enemy units, your own Acolytes die to battle results, and then Cannibalism triggers, placing a fresh Acolyte into the area to immediately take control of the Gate. You can also use this ability when you are not even involved in the fight -- place a Wendigo at a random distant Gate where two other factions are battling, giving you a surprise presence on the other side of the map. Typically, though, you want to keep your forces consolidated in your death ball, so use the remote placement sparingly.

### Howl
**Unlock condition:** One of six available Spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Pre-battle. Before the battle, if any Wendigos are present, you may force an enemy to retreat one unit of their choice out of the area to an adjacent area. This is not a pain. The unit may be moved to an area containing your units.
**Strategic notes:** Howl forces your opponents to over-commit resources to take your Gates. If you have an Acolyte and a Wendigo on a Gate and an opponent moves in a single Star Spawn to attack, you just Howl it out. They wasted their Power moving in and declaring battle, and no dice are ever rolled. This means opponents need to bring multiple units or their Great Old One to have any chance of threatening a Wendigo-defended Gate, which is exactly the kind of inefficiency you want to impose on them. However, do not knee-jerk use Howl in every battle. When you are on offense with your death ball and you want to kill a specific target -- say, Tsathoggua -- do not use Howl, because your opponent will simply retreat the valuable unit you are trying to eliminate. Only Howl when removing a unit genuinely benefits you.

### Berserker Gang
**Unlock condition:** One of six available Spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Post-battle. For each Gnoph-Keh assigned a kill in battle, the enemy must eliminate one additional monster or Cultist.
**Strategic notes:** The value of this Spellbook scales directly with how many Gnoph-Keh you have in play. With zero to two Gnoph-Keh, this is your least useful Spellbook. But once you have three or four on the map, it becomes devastating. Your full death ball can easily roll 25+ dice (12 from Gnoph-Keh, 3 from Rhan-Tegoth, 10+ from Ithaqua, plus Wendigos), and if several Gnoph-Keh die in the battle, each one generates a bonus kill. You can reach a point where there are simply no survivors on the enemy side. Prioritize this Spellbook and the Gnoph-Keh investment when the table has other combat-heavy factions like Great Cthulhu, Crawling Chaos, or Sleeper. In a less fighty composition (Tcho-Tcho, Yellow Sign, Daemon Sultan), you can deprioritize Gnoph-Keh entirely and skip or delay Berserker Gang.

### Herald of the Outer Gods
**Unlock condition:** One of six available Spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Ongoing. Pay 5 Power for Windwalker's Ritual of Annihilation regardless of the number indicated on the ritual track.
**Strategic notes:** This is the main win condition of the faction. It does not matter how expensive the ritual gets for everyone else -- Windwalker always pays 5. On just two Gates with both Great Old Ones in play, you are earning a minimum of 6 doom per ritual (2 doom from Gates + 2 doom from Great Old Ones + whatever doom the ritual itself provides). That is an incredible rate that most factions cannot keep pace with. When combined with Hibernate, which gives you extra Power that effectively makes rituals nearly free, you can ritual every single turn and grind the game to a close. This is why even a defensive, ritual-centric Windwalker is extremely hard to stop: two Gates, two Great Old Ones, five-cost rituals, and free Power from hibernation. Linear doom-scoring factions like Great Cthulhu and Crawling Chaos will have a very difficult time keeping up with 6+ doom per turn.

## Units

### Cultists
- **Cost:** 1 Power to recruit
- **Combat:** 0
- **Count:** 6
- **Role:** Your economic backbone and surprisingly durable Gate-holders. Windwalker Cultists gain enormous value once Ithaqua is in play thanks to the Ferox ability, which makes them immune to capture by enemy monsters -- only enemy Great Old Ones can take them. This means a lone Acolyte on a Gate requires your opponent to bring their Great Old One to steal it, which is a massive commitment. Stack two Acolytes on a Gate with the Ice Age token and it becomes agonizingly expensive to contest. In battle, throw your Cultists under the bus as casualties without hesitation -- Cannibalism lets you immediately replace them if you score kills.

### Wendigos
- **Cost:** 1 Power to summon
- **Combat:** 1
- **Count:** 4
- **Role:** Cheap, efficient combat bodies that punch well above their weight class. At 1 Power for 1 combat die, Wendigos match the efficiency of Undead from Great Cthulhu. Their real value comes from enabling Howl -- any Gate with a Wendigo present forces opponents to over-commit or waste their Power. Wendigos are great for holding down secondary Gates, keeping them safe from lone units that would otherwise capture them. They can also be placed via Cannibalism after battles, giving you surprise board presence. Summon them cheaply during your Power-advantage turns, and do not hesitate to sacrifice them in combat.

### Gnoph-Keh
- **Cost:** Equal to the number of Gnoph-Keh remaining in the pool (first costs 4, second costs 3, third costs 2, fourth costs 1)
- **Combat:** 3
- **Count:** 4
- **Role:** Your heavy hitters and the backbone of the death ball's raw combat power. Four Gnoph-Keh contribute 12 dice to any fight, which is enormous. The inverted cost structure means the first one is very expensive, but once you have most of them out, the last ones cost practically nothing. At 1-2 Power for 3 combat dice, they are among the best value monsters in the game. With Berserker Gang, each Gnoph-Keh killed in battle generates a bonus kill, making them valuable even in death. Whether you invest heavily in Gnoph-Keh should depend on the table composition: against fighty factions (Great Cthulhu, Crawling Chaos, Sleeper), get them all out; against ritual-centric factions (Tcho-Tcho, Yellow Sign, Daemon Sultan), you can get away with fewer or even none.

### Rhan-Tegoth (Great Old One)
- **Cost:** 6 Power to awaken in any area containing a Windwalker glyph (does not require a controlled Gate)
- **Combat:** 3
- **Count:** 1
- **Ability -- Eternal:** Post-battle. If Rhan-Tegoth receives a pain or a kill, you can pay 1 Power to cancel its effect. Rhan-Tegoth can only receive one combat result per battle.
- **Role:** Your indestructible anchor. Rhan-Tegoth is extremely hard to remove from the board as long as you have Power to spend on Eternal, making it perfect for holding down a Gate on its own. Since Rhan-Tegoth does not require a controlled Gate to awaken -- only a Windwalker glyph area -- you can wake it up on the opposite pole to establish a forward position, especially useful with High Priest or Dunwich Horror for additional Cultist access. Be mindful that Crawling Chaos's Narlathotep loves bullying Rhan-Tegoth: even when you cancel the combat result with Eternal, Harbinger still triggers off the original pain or kill assignment. Do not leave Rhan-Tegoth isolated against Crawling Chaos if you can help it.

### Ithaqua (Great Old One)
- **Cost:** 6 Power. Requires that Rhan-Tegoth has been previously awakened (does not need to still be in play) and that a Gate exists in a Windwalker glyph area (you do not need to control it). The Gate is replaced by Ithaqua when awakened.
- **Combat:** Equal to half your opponent's doom, rounded up
- **Count:** 1
- **Ability -- Ferox:** Ongoing. While Ithaqua is in play, your Cultists cannot be captured by enemy monsters or terrors. They remain vulnerable to enemy Great Old Ones.
- **Role:** The general of your army and the linchpin of everything Windwalker does. Ithaqua's combat scaling is terrifying -- once an opponent reaches 20 doom, Ithaqua alone is rolling 10+ dice. Combined with Arctic Wind, Ithaqua moves your entire death ball for a single Power. Ferox makes all your Cultists incredibly sticky on Gates, forcing opponents to commit their Great Old Ones to take them. Never, ever leave Ithaqua isolated. If Ithaqua is killed and there are no Gates on either pole, re-awakening is a nightmare that can lose you the game. Note that awakening Ithaqua deletes a Gate, so avoid doing it at the end of an action phase when you would miss out on the Power and doom from that Gate during the next Gather Power phase. Time it for the start of a big turn when you have plenty of Power to rebuild.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

### Turn 1 (Action Phase 1)

**Recommended Opening -- The Early Hibernate:** Summon a Wendigo at your starting Gate (1 Power, leaving you at 7 Power), then immediately Hibernate. This sounds insane to newer players, but it is actually extremely safe and extremely strong. Nobody is going to march across the map to mess with your starting position in the first action phase -- they have their own priorities like building Gates and preparing to awaken their Great Old Ones. Assuming no other Great Old Ones are in play yet, you bank 7 Power and start Action Phase 2 with approximately 15 Power (7 banked + 8 from Gather Power). This guarantees the First Player Spellbook requirement and sets you up for one of the strongest Turn 2 positions in the game.

**Alternative -- Summon Gnoph-Keh + Hibernate:** Instead of a Wendigo, summon a Gnoph-Keh (4 Power, leaving you at 4 Power), then Hibernate at 4 Power. You start Turn 2 with around 12 Power while reducing the cost of your next Gnoph-Keh to 3. This is less Power overall but gets your expensive monsters started earlier.

**Alternative -- Two-Gate Opening:** Move an Acolyte to an adjacent area, build a Gate (3 Power), summon a couple of Wendigos for protection, and potentially Hibernate with whatever Power remains. You end with two Gates and some leftover Power for next turn. This is the "boring but solid" opening -- a new player will do this naturally and there is nothing wrong with it.

**Not Recommended -- Rush the Opposite Pole:** It is only three spaces away, so you can technically move an Acolyte to the other pole and build a Gate in the first action phase. But savvy opponents will block this by dropping a monster on the other pole. This plan is too prone to disruption unless you can talk the table into letting you through.

### Turn 2 (Action Phase 2)

If you did the Early Hibernate, you are starting with approximately 15 Power while most opponents have 10-12. You have the First Player Spellbook. Take Ice Age as your Spellbook and place the Ice Age token on your starting area. Now your home Gate is defended by 6 Acolytes and Ice Age -- nobody is coming for that.

**The Double Hibernate:** Seriously consider hibernating again immediately on Turn 2. This sounds absurd, but Turn 2 is typically the turn where everyone spends their entire action phase awakening their Great Old One. There is very little anyone can do to threaten you. If one or two Great Old Ones have been awakened before your turn, you gain bonus Power from Hibernate on top of banking your 15. You will start Action Phase 3 with 22-23+ Power. You are building toward an explosive turn.

**Alternative -- Start Building:** If you are uncomfortable with the double hibernate, use Turn 2 to build a second Gate, summon some units, and maybe still Hibernate with your remaining Power. You will be on pace with other players but will not have the massive Power advantage that double hibernating provides.

### Turn 3 (Action Phase 3)

If you double-hibernated, you now have over 20 Power -- more than any other player at the table. This is your first big action turn. Priorities:

1. **Awaken Rhan-Tegoth** (6 Power) in a Windwalker glyph area. Consider awakening it on the opposite pole if you have a way to get a Cultist there (High Priest, etc.) to set up that Gate for your Spellbook requirement.
2. **Build your army** -- summon Gnoph-Keh and Wendigos while their costs are manageable
3. **Build a second Gate** if you only have one
4. Take additional Spellbooks as requirements are met

From here, continue alternating between action turns and hibernate turns. Every other turn, awaken a Great Old One or summon monsters, then hibernate to rebuild your Power reserve. Your goal is to eventually have both Great Old Ones, a sizable army, and 10-15+ Power for the turn where you march out and devastate the map.

## Early Game (Turns 1-3)

The early game for Windwalker is all about patience and accumulation. While other factions scramble to build Gates and awaken their Great Old Ones, you are deliberately choosing to do less in exchange for building an overwhelming Power advantage.

**Priorities:**
1. Hibernate early and often to stockpile Power -- the bonus Power from enemy Great Old Ones in play makes this increasingly valuable as the game progresses
2. Take Ice Age as your first Spellbook and use it to protect your starting position
3. Earn the First Player requirement by having the most Power (trivially easy after a single hibernate)
4. Do not rush the opposite-pole Gate requirement -- you will handle it during your big explosive turn
5. Keep your starting area unappealing to attack: 6 Acolytes, Ice Age, and eventually a Great Old One make it a terrible target

**Key Principle:** Your doom tempo will be painfully slow in the early game -- expect just one doom per turn for the first few action phases. This is fine. You are trading early doom for a position that will generate far more doom in the mid and late game. Do not panic about falling behind on the doom track early.

## Mid Game (Turns 4-5)

The mid game is when Windwalker transitions from hibernation mode to action mode. By now you should have both Great Old Ones awakened (or close to it), a growing army, and a massive Power reserve from repeated hibernation.

**Priorities:**
1. Complete the death ball -- get Ithaqua, Rhan-Tegoth, Gnoph-Keh, and Wendigos consolidated into one area
2. Plan your path to the opposite pole, ideally crossing through under-defended enemy Gates along the way
3. Take Arctic Wind when you awaken Ithaqua and start moving the death ball as a unit for 1 Power per area
4. Claim Gates along your march route -- you should be able to end your big turn on three or four Gates
5. Start ritualing once you have Herald of the Outer Gods -- 5-Power rituals on two or more Gates is your endgame engine

**The Big Turn:** This is the moment you have been building toward. With 15-20+ Power, move your death ball out of your starting area and march across the map. Use Arctic Wind to move everyone for 1 Power per space. Smash through enemy Gates, capture Acolytes (Ferox protects yours from retaliation), build a Gate on the opposite pole for your Spellbook requirement, and arrive at the end of the turn with three or more Gates. If this turn goes well, you may earn two or three Spellbooks in a single action phase.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

Once you have all your Spellbooks, Windwalker's endgame is remarkably straightforward: hold two Gates, ritual every turn for 5 Power, and grind out the doom victory.

**The Ritual Engine:**
- Two Gates + two Great Old Ones + Herald of the Outer Gods = minimum 6 doom per turn
- Hibernate with leftover Power to make next turn's ritual essentially free
- Three free Elder Signs from your final Spellbook requirement add roughly 5 doom on average
- Even linear-scoring factions like Great Cthulhu and Crawling Chaos struggle to keep pace with consistent 6+ doom per turn

**Death Ball Maintenance:**
- Keep Ithaqua surrounded at all times -- it must never be isolated
- Ithaqua's combat scales with opponent doom, so it becomes increasingly terrifying as the game progresses (10+ dice when an opponent hits 20 doom)
- Use Howl and Cannibalism to make attacking your death ball as painful and inefficient as possible
- If you can end on three Gates even once or twice, the doom lead becomes insurmountable

**Late Hibernate Strategy:** Even in the late game, hibernate when you have 1-3 Power remaining after your actions. Those stored Power points plus the bonus from enemy Great Old Ones essentially pay for your next ritual. In a low-resource game where everyone is struggling for Power, Windwalker thrives because Hibernate provides virtual Power that no one else has access to.

**Saving the Free Spellbook:** Consider making the Elder Sign Spellbook (take at any time) the last book you take. It is not an action to claim it, so you can take it at any moment -- even right before declaring a battle. This lets you catch opponents off guard by suddenly gaining Unlimited Combat when they thought you were still at five Spellbooks.

## Power Combos & Synergies

**Hibernate + Herald of the Outer Gods:** The core economic engine. Hibernate stores Power and gains bonus Power from enemy Great Old Ones. Herald locks your ritual cost at 5. Together, you can ritual every single turn while other factions struggle to afford increasingly expensive rituals. This is your primary win condition.

**Arctic Wind + Death Ball:** Move Ithaqua and your entire army for 1 Power. When your death ball includes Ithaqua (10+ dice), Rhan-Tegoth (3 dice), four Gnoph-Keh (12 dice), and several Wendigos (1 die each), you are rolling 25+ combat dice and can wipe entire factions off the map in a single battle. Moving all of that for 1 Power is absurd efficiency.

**Cannibalism + Expendable Units:** Sacrifice Acolytes and Wendigos freely in combat, knowing that Cannibalism replaces them as long as you kill at least one enemy unit. The best play is fighting at a Gate: your Acolytes die, Cannibalism places a fresh Acolyte, and you immediately take control of the Gate.

**Ferox + Ice Age + Howl:** The Gate defense trinity. Ferox means only Great Old Ones can capture your Cultists. Ice Age taxes every action in the area by 1 Power. Howl forces a unit out before battle even begins. An opponent trying to steal a Gate protected by all three needs to bring their Great Old One, pay extra Power for everything, and still deal with losing a unit to Howl before dice are rolled. Most players will simply go after someone else.

**Berserker Gang + Full Gnoph-Keh Complement:** With all four Gnoph-Keh on the map, they contribute 12 dice and each death generates a bonus kill. In a big battle, this can create cascading eliminations where the enemy side has zero survivors. Combine with Ithaqua's scaling dice for truly overwhelming combat power.

**Rhan-Tegoth + Eternal on Opposite Pole:** Awaken Rhan-Tegoth on the far pole without needing a controlled Gate. Use Eternal to shrug off combat results while establishing a forward position. With High Priest or similar independent access, build a Gate there without having to march your entire army across the map.

## Factions to Watch Out For

**Crawling Chaos:** Your most dangerous opponent. Narlathotep loves fighting Rhan-Tegoth because Harbinger triggers even when you cancel the combat result with Eternal -- Crawling Chaos still collects their Elder Signs or Power. Madness can scatter your death ball across the map, undoing your careful consolidation. If Crawling Chaos gets Unlimited Combat and starts chaining Harbinger hits against both your Great Old Ones, the Elder Sign payout is enormous for them. Keep your death ball tight and avoid letting either Great Old One get caught alone.

**Coordinated Opponents:** An experienced table will recognize that Windwalker with two Gates and Herald of the Outer Gods is generating unsustainable doom. Stopping Windwalker is genuinely a group project -- no single faction can easily take you down when you are fully online. If the table coordinates to deny you Gates and snipe Ithaqua, things get very difficult. This is one reason Windwalker is considered one of the best factions: it takes multiple opponents working together to stop you.

## Matchups

### vs Great Cthulhu
Cthulhu is a fellow combat-heavy faction, but your death ball typically outclasses theirs in a straight fight thanks to Ithaqua's scaling dice. Be careful not to start on the Arctic Ocean, as you would contribute to Cthulhu's Ocean Gates Spellbook requirement. Invest in Gnoph-Keh and Berserker Gang in this matchup, as you will likely need to brawl.

### vs Black Goat
Black Goat is less of a direct combat threat and more of a doom-racing concern. They can spread wide and generate doom through Fertility Cult and multiple Gates. Your advantage is that Ferox prevents their monsters from capturing your Cultists. Focus on your own ritual engine rather than chasing Black Goat across the map.

### vs Crawling Chaos
Your toughest matchup. Narlathotep farms Harbinger Elder Signs off both your Great Old Ones, and Madness can split your death ball apart. Do not leave Rhan-Tegoth isolated where Narlathotep can bully it for free Elder Signs. Keep your forces consolidated so that any engagement with Crawling Chaos is on your terms with overwhelming dice.

### vs Yellow Sign
Yellow Sign is generally less threatening in direct combat but can doom-rush through Desecration and rituals. Howl and Ferox make it hard for Yellow Sign to steal your Gates without committing Hastur or the King in Yellow. Ice Age on a contested Gate near Yellow Sign territory is particularly effective since their Undead are cheap but become much less efficient when taxed.

### vs Opener of the Way
Opener has strong monsters (Spawn of Yog-Sothoth) and Dragon Ascending/Descending can reposition units in unexpected ways. Your death ball should overpower theirs in a direct fight, but watch out for Yog-Sothoth's ability to move your Great Old Ones. Keep your forces together and leverage your Power advantage from hibernation to outlast them.

### vs Sleeper
Sleeper is a patient, grinding faction that can be deceptively strong. Tsathoggua with Cursed Slumber can stall your attacks. If Sleeper copies Hibernate with Ancient Sorcery, that is a problem, but they typically covet Flight from Crawling Chaos more. Pressure Sleeper before they get fully online with all their Spellbooks and copied abilities.

### vs Tcho-Tcho
Tcho-Tcho are aggressive early with cheap monsters and Terror mechanics. In this matchup, Gnoph-Keh are less critical since Tcho-Tcho are not a heavy combat faction in the traditional sense. Focus on your ritual engine and let your natural Power advantage from hibernation carry you past their early aggression.

### vs Ancients
Ancients play a doom game through Primeval markers and area control rather than combat. They may not fight you directly, but their passive doom generation can be hard to keep pace with. Fortunately, Herald of the Outer Gods lets you ritual-race them effectively. Use your death ball to contest key regions if they start pulling ahead.

### vs Daemon Sultan
Daemon Sultan has three Great Old Ones, which is a double-edged sword for you: more enemy Great Old Ones means more bonus Power from Hibernate, but Daemon Sultan can also generate enormous doom through rituals. This is often a ritual-racing matchup where both factions try to outpace the other with consistent doom generation.

### vs Bubastis
Bubastis has unique mechanics that can catch you off guard. Study their Spellbooks carefully and play your standard game: hibernate, build the death ball, ritual consistently. Your fundamental strengths -- overwhelming combat power, efficient rituals, and sticky Gates -- apply regardless of what Bubastis is doing.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Never hibernating or barely using it.** Hibernate is your single greatest advantage over every other faction. Using it sparingly means playing Windwalker like a generic faction without its signature strength. Embrace the early hibernation -- you should be banking Power aggressively in the first two to three action phases.

2. **Rushing to the opposite pole on Turn 1.** While technically possible, this plan is easily disrupted by any opponent who drops a monster on the other pole. You do not need this Spellbook early. Save it for your big explosive turn when you can march your death ball across the map and accomplish multiple objectives at once.

3. **Leaving Ithaqua isolated.** This is the single fastest way to lose a game as Windwalker. If Ithaqua is killed and there are no Gates on either pole, re-awakening requires rebuilding a Gate on a pole first. Keep Ithaqua surrounded by your army at all times.

4. **Awakening Ithaqua at the end of an action phase.** Ithaqua replaces a Gate when awakened. If you do this right before the Gather Power phase, you lose the Power and doom from that Gate for nothing. Awaken Ithaqua at the start of a big turn when you have the Power to make the most of it.

5. **Panicking about slow early doom.** Windwalker naturally falls behind on the doom track in the first few action phases. This is the cost of hibernating, and it is worth it. Once Herald of the Outer Gods is online with two Gates, you will catch up rapidly with 6+ doom per turn.

6. **Using Howl reflexively in every battle.** When you are attacking and want to kill a specific enemy unit (like a Great Old One), Howl lets your opponent retreat that exact unit to safety. Only Howl when removing a unit from the battle genuinely benefits you -- typically on defense, not offense.

7. **Taking the free Elder Sign Spellbook too early.** Each enemy player with six Spellbooks is worth one Elder Sign, up to three. Taking this Spellbook before at least three opponents have all their books means leaving free doom on the table -- potentially 5+ doom from Elder Signs you could have earned by waiting.

8. **Splitting your forces across the map.** Windwalker's power is concentration. Arctic Wind lets you move your entire death ball together cheaply. Spreading units thin negates your combat advantage and leaves individual groups vulnerable. Consolidate, move together, and strike with overwhelming force.

## Tips & Tricks from the Podcast

- **Hibernate is not just for when you have nothing to do -- it is a deliberate strategy.** The best Windwalker players intentionally Hibernate with 7+ Power on Turn 1, starting the next turn with 15 Power and the First Player Spellbook. This sets up a cascading advantage that compounds every turn.

- **The double hibernate (hibernating on both Turn 1 and Turn 2) is legitimate.** You will start Turn 3 with 22-23+ Power. Nobody else at the table will come close. Turn 2 is typically safe because everyone is busy awakening their Great Old One and cannot spare resources to bother you.

- **Count Windwalker as having 2.5 Great Old Ones.** The Ice Age token is so impactful that it functions like half a Great Old One for Gate defense purposes. Two Great Old Ones on two Gates plus Ice Age on a third means you can effectively hold three Gates with minimal additional investment.

- **Adapt your Gnoph-Keh investment to the table composition.** Against fighty factions (Great Cthulhu, Crawling Chaos, Sleeper), get all four Gnoph-Keh out and take Berserker Gang. Against less combative factions (Tcho-Tcho, Yellow Sign, Daemon Sultan), you can skip Gnoph-Keh entirely and focus on the ritual engine.

- **The free Spellbook can be taken at any time -- even mid-turn.** Since it is not an action, you can take it right before declaring a battle to surprise opponents with Unlimited Combat, or take it between actions to unlock a Spellbook you have been waiting for. Time this for maximum surprise value.

- **Your late-game ritual math is devastating.** Two Gates, two Great Old Ones, 5-Power rituals, plus approximately five free doom from Elder Signs. Even without a single moment of combat, this engine will close out the game. Most factions simply cannot match 6+ doom per turn sustained over multiple action phases.

- **When opponents hibernate-check you by attacking your Gates, make them pay.** Ice Age plus Ferox plus Howl means any Gate attack costs the opponent far more than it costs you. If they commit their Great Old One, you get to fight them with your death ball. If they do not bring their Great Old One, Ferox means they cannot even capture your Cultists.

- **Thwarting Windwalker requires coordination.** If you are playing against Windwalker: talk to the other players, never let them hold more than two Gates, and snipe Ithaqua whenever it is isolated. Attacking Rhan-Tegoth while Windwalker is hibernating drains their stored Power via Eternal, even if you cannot kill it.
