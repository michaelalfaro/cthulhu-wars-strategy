# Crawling Chaos

## Overview

Crawling Chaos is one of the original four factions in Cthulhu Wars and arguably the most devious faction in the entire game. Built around mobility, social manipulation, and devastating Great Old One assassination runs, this faction rewards cunning players who enjoy wheeling and dealing -- and occasionally backstabbing at the perfect moment.

- **Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced. You need strong table awareness, negotiation skills, and the ability to track every battle on the board for your Madness spellbook.
- **Starting Setup:** 8 Power, 6 Acolytes, always in South Asia.
- **Unique Faction Ability:** Flight -- all your units (even Cultists) can fly over two areas containing enemy units. This is widely considered one of the two or three best faction abilities in the game.
- **Playstyle:** Great Old One-centric assassin. Nearly all of your plans revolve around having Nyarlathotep in play, hunting enemy Great Old Ones for Elder Signs via Harbinger, and using Madness to politically control every battle on the board.

When played well, Crawling Chaos is one of the strongest and most dangerous factions in the game. Once fully online with all six spellbooks, this faction can end games in explosive bursts of Elder Signs that seem to come from nowhere.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

Crawling Chaos is the trickster faction. Where other factions rely on brute force or economic engines, Crawling Chaos thrives on social engineering, precise strikes, and controlling the flow of battle outcomes across the entire map.

**Core Strengths:**
- Unmatched mobility via Flight -- nowhere on the map is safe from you
- Madness gives you political control over every battle in the game, even ones you are not in
- Harbinger is your win condition, letting you burst Elder Signs by paining enemy Great Old Ones
- Thousand Forms provides free Power generation with strong social pressure
- Emissary of the Outer Gods makes Nyarlathotep nearly unkillable by non-GOO units
- Nyarlathotep scales with both players' spellbook counts, reaching up to 12 combat dice

**Core Weaknesses:**
- Extremely GOO-dependent -- if Nyarlathotep dies, your faction crumbles
- Monsters are weak individually (0, 1, and 2 combat dice)
- Expensive spellbook requirements (Pay 4 and Pay 6 Power eat into your economy)
- Thousand Forms has high variance (rolling 1s vs 6s is a huge swing)
- Requires constant attention to every battle for Madness (can slow the game if you are not snappy)

**Key Philosophy:** You are a scalpel, not a hammer. You want to pick your fights carefully, bring overwhelming force when you do engage, and use Madness and Invisibility to tilt every battle in your favor -- or in your allies' favor, when it suits you.

## Spellbook Abilities

### Madness
**Unlock condition:** One of six available spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Post-battle. After all pain results are assigned to units but before they are applied, you choose where all units are pained to rather than their owner. You can pain them in any order rather than the normal attacker-then-defender sequence. This applies even in battles in which you do not participate.
**Strategic notes:** This is the signature spellbook of the faction and one of the strongest spellbooks in the entire game. Once you have Madness, every battle for the rest of the game is under your influence. Use it politically: ask allies where they want to be pained and honor their requests -- or betray them at the decisive moment. Against enemies, scatter their forces to the winds. Against death balls, split them apart. You can even engineer surrounds by paining units into positions where another faction will eliminate them. Against Black Goat specifically, be careful not to spread their units into many areas (which actually helps them). Always be paying attention to every battle so you can resolve Madness quickly without slowing the game down.

### Emissary of the Outer Gods
**Unlock condition:** One of six available spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Post-battle. Unless an enemy Great Old One is involved in the battle, a kill applied to Nyarlathotep becomes a pain instead. Additionally, if Nyarlathotep cannot be pained due to being surrounded, he is not eliminated.
**Strategic notes:** This is essential protection for your most important unit. Take this almost every time as one of your first two spellbooks, ideally right when Nyarlathotep is awakened. It makes Nyarlathotep immune to being killed by random monsters -- only enemy Great Old Ones can threaten a true kill. This also makes it trivial to fly Nyarlathotep into enemy areas to capture Acolytes for your spellbook requirement, since the worst they can do without a GOO is pain you away. Sometimes they will even pain you right into another area with a Gate, enabling further captures.

### Thousand Forms
**Unlock condition:** One of six available spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Zero-cost action. If Nyarlathotep is in play, roll a d6. Your foes lose that much Power between them. They have one minute to decide how much each player loses. If they cannot agree, you gain the rolled number as Power instead. This spellbook flips face-down after use and resets during the Gather Power phase.
**Strategic notes:** Take this as one of your first two spellbooks and use it every single action phase. Even in the worst case where opponents pay for it, you are still draining Power from them, which is valuable. In the best case (high roll and no one can pay), you get a massive Power injection. This is your tool for offsetting the expensive Pay 4 and Pay 6 spellbook requirements. Bargain with allies -- tell them you will not use the Power against them (whether or not you intend to keep that promise). Timing matters: use it early if you need the Power to hit 12 or 15 for a spellbook requirement, or use it late when opponents are low on Power and cannot afford to pay. The variance can be swingy -- rolling three 6s in a game feels unstoppable; rolling all 1s feels terrible. But the expected value over time is strongly in your favor.

### Invisibility
**Unlock condition:** One of six available spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Pre-battle. Select one monster or Cultist from either faction per Flying Polyp present and exempt it from the battle. The selected unit does not participate in the rest of the battle.
**Strategic notes:** This is surprisingly potent and perhaps slightly underutilized. On offense, exempt the enemy monsters rolling the most dice (Spawn of Yog-Sothoth, Formless Spawn, Star Spawn, etc.) to swing decisive battles in your favor. On defense, a single Flying Polyp on a Gate makes it impossible for a lone enemy monster to take -- you just exempt them every time they declare battle, and they waste their Power. A Flying Polyp can also exempt itself from a losing battle, making it functionally indestructible; it just stays in the area and continues menacing the Gate. Station Flying Polyps on contested Gates around the map for persistent, low-cost area denial.

### Abduct
**Unlock condition:** One of six available spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Pre-battle. Eliminate one or more Nightgaunts in the battle. For each Nightgaunt eliminated, your enemy must eliminate a monster or Cultist from the battle.
**Strategic notes:** Not the most powerful spellbook, but it has useful applications. On defense, if an expensive monster (Star Spawn, etc.) moves to attack your Gate, sacrifice a Nightgaunt to eliminate it before dice are rolled -- you lose a 1-cost unit and they lose a much more expensive one. In big fights targeting Great Old Ones, use Abduct to strip away cheap enemy units before combat, leaving only the juicy GOO targets for your dice. Since Nightgaunts only cost 1 Power to resummon, the trade is almost always in your favor. The opponent chooses what they lose, but that is usually their cheapest unit, which still clears the board for your big hits.

### Seek and Destroy
**Unlock condition:** One of six available spellbook slots (choose when unlocking any requirement).
**Effect:** Pre-battle. Immediately move any or all Hunting Horrors from any area into the battle area.
**Strategic notes:** This is a very strong force projection ability. Once you have Seek and Destroy, you essentially never need to spend Power moving your Hunting Horrors -- they teleport into any battle for free. This means 4 extra combat dice (if both Horrors are alive) plus two extra bodies to absorb hits, all at zero cost. When combined with Nyarlathotep's potential 12 dice, you can roll up to 16 dice in a single battle. However, Hunting Horrors cost 3 each to resummon, so protect them. Assign pain and kill results to cheaper units (Nightgaunts, Acolytes) whenever possible to keep your Horrors alive across multiple battles, extracting maximum value.

## Units

### Cultists
- **Cost:** 1 Power to recruit
- **Combat:** 0
- **Count:** 6
- **Role:** Your economic backbone and surprisingly mobile capture units. Thanks to Flight, even your Cultists can reach remote areas two zones away, making it easy to claim abandoned Gates or spread across the map for Power generation. Use them as bodies in battle to absorb hits and protect Nyarlathotep. Stacking two Acolytes on a Gate adds meaningful capture protection without spending Power on monsters.

### Nightgaunts
- **Cost:** 1 Power to summon
- **Combat:** 0
- **Count:** 3
- **Role:** Cheap, disposable tactical units. They cannot initiate battles (0 combat), but they are excellent at pressuring opponents who are trying to build Gates -- fly one in and force them to either waste a move or get captured. At 1 Power each, they are the perfect meat shields for Nyarlathotep. Throw them into battles as ablative armor and resummon them cheaply next turn. Their primary spellbook, Abduct, lets them trade 1-for-1 with much more expensive enemy units before dice are even rolled.

### Flying Polyps
- **Cost:** 2 Power to summon
- **Combat:** 1
- **Count:** 3
- **Role:** The cheapest combat-capable unit in your roster. Their real value comes from the Invisibility spellbook, which exempts one unit per Polyp from any battle. Polyps are excellent as area denial tools -- park one on a contested Gate and no single enemy monster can dislodge it. They can also exempt themselves from losing battles, making them functionally indestructible. On offense, bring Polyps alongside Nyarlathotep to strip away the enemy's best dice-rollers before combat begins.

### Hunting Horrors
- **Cost:** 3 Power to summon
- **Combat:** 2
- **Count:** 2
- **Role:** Your heavy hitters (by Crawling Chaos standards). At 2 combat each, they provide meaningful dice support. Their true value comes from Seek and Destroy, which lets them teleport into any battle for free. This means you never spend Power moving them -- just leave them anywhere on the map and they fly in when needed. Both Horrors joining a Nyarlathotep battle adds 4 dice and 2 extra bodies for free. Protect these units aggressively. At 3 Power each to resummon, losing even one is a significant setback for a faction where every Power counts.

### Nyarlathotep (Great Old One)
- **Cost:** 10 Power to awaken at a controlled Gate
- **Combat:** Equal to the total of your faction spellbooks plus your opponent's faction spellbooks in the battle (maximum 12 dice at 6+6)
- **Count:** 1
- **Ability -- Harbinger:** Post-battle. If Nyarlathotep is in a battle in which one or more enemy Great Old Ones are pained or killed, you receive Power equal to half the cost to awaken those GOOs. Per enemy GOO, you may choose to receive 2 Elder Signs instead of Power. Harbinger takes effect even if Nyarlathotep himself is killed or pained in the battle.
- **Role:** The absolute centerpiece of the faction. Nyarlathotep is your bread and butter -- nearly all of your plans revolve around him. He is your primary damage dealer, your win condition via Harbinger, and the lynchpin that enables Thousand Forms. Awaken him in Action Phase 2 (99% of the time) and protect him at all costs. The scaling combat dice mechanic means he gets stronger as the game progresses and both sides collect spellbooks, reaching a terrifying 12 dice in late-game fights. Use Harbinger to choose Elder Signs vs Power strategically: take Elder Signs from cheap GOOs (King in Yellow, Rhan-Tegoth) and take Power from expensive ones (8-10 cost) to fuel further attacks.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

### Turn 1 (Action Phase 1)

**Standard Opening:** Move an Acolyte to a remote area (Flight makes this easy), Build a Gate (3 Power), then summon monsters with your remaining 4 Power. Your monster choices shape your early game:
- **2 Flying Polyps (4 Power):** Sets up Invisibility and area denial. Recommended if you expect early aggression.
- **1 Nightgaunt + 1 Hunting Horror (4 Power):** Balanced option with immediate battle capability and a cheap body.

**Aggressive Nightgaunt Opening:** Summon a Nightgaunt as your very first action of the entire game (1 Power). Then use it to pressure opponents trying to build Gates -- fly it into their target area. They either waste a Power moving away or build the Gate and get captured, giving you a free spellbook and potentially a Gate. If the capture works, you enter Action Phase 2 with around 11 Power, enough to awaken Nyarlathotep and activate Thousand Forms.

**Greedy 3-Gate Opening:** With Flight, you can reach remote corners of the map that others cannot easily contest. Move, Build, Move, Build to end Turn 1 with 3 Gates. This is incredibly strong -- it gets you a spellbook requirement and sets up a 12+ Power Turn 2. However, it paints a huge target on you. Only attempt this if the faction mix at the table lets you get away with it.

### Turn 2 (Action Phase 2)

**Primary Goal: Awaken Nyarlathotep.** You should be doing this 99% of the time. He costs 10 Power, so you need at least 2 Gates to afford him (10 Power from Gather Phase). Take Emissary of the Outer Gods and Thousand Forms as your first two spellbooks (in either order depending on which requirements you have fulfilled).

If something went wrong (e.g., Yellow Sign captured one of your Acolytes from Arabia, dropping you to 8-9 Power), pivot: build a 3rd Gate to get that spellbook requirement, take Invisibility, and use your Flying Polyps to prey on lightly defended Gates. Ensure that by Action Phase 3, you have enough Power to awaken Nyarlathotep no matter what.

### Turn 3 (Action Phase 3)

If you awakened Nyarlathotep on Turn 2, Turn 3 is about getting your remaining spellbooks and starting to pressure opponents. Priorities:
- Pay the 6 Power spellbook requirement now -- it only gets harder to afford later
- Use Thousand Forms for Power generation
- Start hunting lightly defended Gates and isolated Acolytes for your Capture Cultist spellbook requirement
- Begin looking for Harbinger opportunities against vulnerable Great Old Ones
- Take Madness as soon as possible to start controlling battle outcomes

## Early Game (Turns 1-3)

Your early game goals are straightforward: establish an economic base, get Nyarlathotep online, and collect spellbooks as fast as possible.

**Priorities:**
1. Build 2-3 Gates using Flight to reach remote, defensible locations
2. Awaken Nyarlathotep in Action Phase 2 (non-negotiable if at all possible)
3. Take Emissary of the Outer Gods and Thousand Forms as your first two spellbooks
4. Begin paying for your 4-Power and 6-Power spellbook requirements -- eat these costs early before the late game squeeze
5. Start building political relationships -- you will need allies for Madness and Thousand Forms

**Key Principle:** Do not delay. Every turn you spend without Nyarlathotep is a turn where you are just a faction with bad monsters. The faster you get online, the faster you become the most dangerous faction at the table.

## Mid Game (Turns 4-5)

The mid game is where Crawling Chaos transforms from setup mode into predator mode. By now you should have Nyarlathotep, most or all of your spellbooks, and a clear picture of who is ahead.

**Priorities:**
1. Finish collecting all six spellbooks if you have not already
2. Obtain unlimited combat -- this is when the Train of Pain becomes available
3. Use Madness politically to build and maintain alliances
4. Start identifying your Harbinger targets -- which enemy GOOs are most vulnerable?
5. Use Thousand Forms every action phase without exception
6. Begin positioning for your late-game Elder Sign burst

**Defensive Posture:** If the table is united against you, turtle up. Place Nyarlathotep in an area with multiple cheap units (Nightgaunts, Acolytes, a Flying Polyp or two). With Invisibility exempting the biggest threats and Emissary preventing non-GOO kills, it takes an enormous commitment of resources to actually kill Nyarlathotep. Make the cost of attacking you so high that opponents look for easier targets.

**Gate Defense:** A Gate defended by one Acolyte, one Nightgaunt, and one Flying Polyp is surprisingly robust. No single enemy monster can take it (Invisibility neutralizes them). The opponent needs to commit multiple monsters or their GOO, which plays into your hands.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

This is where Crawling Chaos wins games. Your goal is to engineer an explosive burst of Elder Signs via Harbinger to jump from the low 20s in doom to 30+ in a single action phase.

**The Harbinger Doom Rush:**
1. Get to around 20-22 doom through Gates and rituals
2. With unlimited combat, fly Nyarlathotep into an area with an enemy Great Old One
3. Bring plenty of bodies (Seek and Destroy your Hunting Horrors in, plus Nightgaunts and Polyps)
4. Fight, pain the enemy GOO, and choose Elder Signs (2 per GOO) via Harbinger
5. Use Madness to pain yourself into an adjacent area with another enemy GOO
6. Fight again (unlimited combat), collect more Elder Signs
7. A chain of 2-3 fights can yield 4-6 Elder Signs, translating to 5-8+ doom in a single phase

**Target Selection for Harbinger:**
- Take Elder Signs from cheap GOOs (King in Yellow, Rhan-Tegoth, etc.) -- the Power alternative from cheap GOOs is minimal
- Take Power from expensive GOOs (8-10 cost) if Nyarlathotep survives, as the 4-5 Power can fund further attacks
- Factions with multiple GOOs (Windwalker, Yellow Sign, Daemon Sultan) are ideal targets -- fighting 2-3 GOOs in one battle is 4-6 Elder Signs at once

**Key Insight:** It does not matter if Nyarlathotep dies during the burst. Harbinger triggers even if he is killed or pained. If you gained 6 Elder Signs and you were at 22 doom, the game is simply over.

## Power Combos & Synergies

**Madness + Train of Pain:** With unlimited combat, get pained out of one battle and into an area with another enemy force. Immediately declare another battle. Use Madness to position your next pain into yet another area. Chain 2-3 battles in a single turn for devastating effect.

**Harbinger + Unlimited Combat:** The core win condition combo. Fight multiple Great Old Ones in a single action phase, collecting Elder Signs from each one. A burst of 4-6 Elder Signs can end the game from what looks like a losing position.

**Invisibility + Defensive Polyps:** Park Flying Polyps on contested Gates. They exempt themselves from losing battles (indestructible) and exempt enemy monsters from battles they initiate (area denial). A single Polyp on a Gate requires the opponent to commit far more resources than the Gate is worth.

**Seek and Destroy + Nyarlathotep:** Move Nyarlathotep into battle, then fly in both Hunting Horrors for free. You go from 12 dice to 16 dice with 2 extra bodies to absorb hits, all without spending a single Power on Hunting Horror movement.

**Thousand Forms + Spellbook Requirements:** Use Thousand Forms to push your Power total from 10 to 12 or from 12 to 15 to hit your Gate/Power spellbook thresholds without needing to build extra Gates.

**Emissary + Gate Raiding:** With Emissary active, fly Nyarlathotep alone into enemy Gates to capture Acolytes. The worst they can do (without a GOO) is pain you away. You get a spellbook requirement and possibly a Gate, with virtually no risk.

## Factions to Watch Out For

**Yellow Sign:** In the classic four-faction game, Yellow Sign starts close to you and can awaken the King in Yellow in Arabia, then march into South Asia to capture your Acolytes in Action Phase 1. This can delay your Nyarlathotep awakening by a full turn. Establish an early non-aggression pact or be ready with a backup plan.

**Any faction with a strong GOO-hunting capability:** Factions that can reliably kill Nyarlathotep are your biggest threats. If the table cooperates to isolate and kill him, your faction collapses -- your monsters cannot carry the game alone.

**Factions that do not care about Madness:** Some factions (like those with minimal combat interactions) can partially ignore your political leverage. Know who you have leverage over and who you do not.

## Matchups

### vs Great Cthulhu
Cthulhu needs to be your friend. Madness is devastating to Cthulhu's plans -- if you are enemies, you will scatter his forces across the map every battle. Offer a Madness alliance: you pain his units favorably, and he does not target you. Cthulhu's Dreams ability threatens your lone-Acolyte Gates, so stack extra Acolytes or Nightgaunts on Gates near ocean zones.

### vs Black Goat
Be careful with Madness against Black Goat -- scattering their units into many areas can actually help them spread Fungi and hit their spellbook requirements. Instead, use Madness to clump Black Goat's forces together where they are less useful. Their monsters are individually strong (Fungi, Dark Young), so Invisibility is valuable for neutralizing them. Target Shub-Niggurath with Harbinger when the opportunity arises.

### vs Yellow Sign
Your closest neighbor in the classic setup and an early-game threat. The King in Yellow can raid South Asia before you are ready. Negotiate early or prepare a defensive posture. In the mid-to-late game, Yellow Sign with the Desecration engine can doom-rush faster than you if left unchecked. Use Madness to keep Hastur and the King in Yellow separated and vulnerable to Harbinger strikes.

### vs Opener of the Way
Opener is dangerous because Yog-Sothoth can move enemy GOOs and is expensive enough that taking Power via Harbinger is worthwhile (5 Power from a 10-cost GOO). Watch out for Dragon Ascending/Descending shenanigans that can reposition your forces unexpectedly. Invisibility is strong against Spawn of Yog-Sothoth, which roll lots of dice.

### vs Sleeper
Sleeper covets your Flight ability for their Ancient Sorcery copy mechanic -- Flight is one of the most desirable abilities in the game. Tsathoggua is hard to deal with because of his lethargy mechanics and Cursed Slumber. Sleeper can be a patient, grinding threat. Try to pressure them before they get fully online.

### vs Windwalker
Windwalker has multiple Great Old Ones (Ithaqua and Rhan-Tegoth), making them a prime Harbinger target. Fighting both GOOs in a single battle could yield 4 Elder Signs. However, Windwalker is also highly mobile and aggressive with Howl and their own train of pain. Respect their combat power and bring plenty of bodies to any engagement.

### vs Tcho-Tcho
Tcho-Tcho are aggressive early and can generate enormous Power from their proto-Shoggoths and Terror mechanics. Their relatively cheap GOO and monster-heavy playstyle gives Invisibility lots of targets to exempt. Watch out for their ability to snowball if left unchecked in the early game.

### vs Ancients
Ancients play a very different game focused on the Primeval marker and controlling multiple regions. They may not fight you directly as much as other factions, but their ability to deny regions and gain doom passively means you cannot ignore them. Look for Harbinger opportunities against their GOO when it ventures out.

### vs Daemon Sultan
Daemon Sultan has three Great Old Ones -- Azathoth, plus two others. This is a Harbinger dream scenario. If you can engage a battle with two or three of their GOOs, the Elder Sign payout is enormous. However, Daemon Sultan is also chaotic and dangerous. Coordinate with allies to keep them from snowballing before you are ready for the big fight.

### vs Bubastis
Bubastis has unique mechanics that can catch you off guard. Study their spellbooks and GOO abilities carefully. Your standard game plan of Harbinger assassination still applies -- identify when their GOO is vulnerable and strike. Madness gives you leverage in any battle they participate in or near.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Delaying Nyarlathotep's awakening past Action Phase 2.** He is your entire strategy. Every turn without him is a turn wasted. If you cannot awaken him on Turn 2, it must happen on Turn 3 -- no later.

2. **Not paying for the 4-Power and 6-Power spellbook requirements early.** These costs only get more painful as the game progresses. Pay them in Action Phase 3 if possible, especially the 6-cost. Getting locked behind this paywall when other factions have unlimited combat is a death sentence.

3. **Forgetting to use Thousand Forms every action phase.** It is a free action. There is zero reason not to use it every turn that Nyarlathotep is alive. Even if opponents pay for it, draining their Power is valuable.

4. **Not paying attention to battles for Madness.** If you have Madness, you need to be tracking every battle on the board and making pain placement decisions quickly. A Crawling Chaos player who is zoning out or not paying attention slows the entire game and wastes their most powerful spellbook.

5. **Leaving Nyarlathotep exposed without an entourage.** Never let your GOO get caught alone once enemies have unlimited combat. Always keep cheap bodies (Nightgaunts, Acolytes, Polyps) nearby to absorb hits. Losing Nyarlathotep is catastrophic -- your remaining monsters have terrible stats and cannot win the game alone.

6. **Resummoning Hunting Horrors unnecessarily.** At 3 Power each, Hunting Horrors are expensive to replace. Assign kills and pains to cheaper units whenever possible. The longer your Horrors survive, the more free Seek and Destroy value they generate across multiple battles.

7. **Ignoring the social dimension of the game.** Crawling Chaos is a deeply political faction. If you are not making deals, leveraging Madness for alliances, and negotiating Thousand Forms outcomes, you are leaving a huge amount of value on the table.

8. **Trying to fight without Nyarlathotep.** Your monsters are weak. Nightgaunts roll 0 dice. Flying Polyps roll 1. Hunting Horrors roll 2. Without Nyarlathotep and his scaling combat, you simply do not have the firepower to win meaningful battles.

## Tips & Tricks

- **Flight is arguably the best movement ability in the game.** You are always at most two moves from anywhere. In the early game, this lets you claim remote Gates with ease. In the late game, nobody can hide from you. Sleeper players consistently rate Flight as one of the top abilities they want to copy with Ancient Sorcery.

- **Backstabbing at the right moment can win you the game.** Crawling Chaos thrives on alliances of convenience. Keep your word most of the time to build trust, but recognize that a well-timed betrayal -- especially using Madness to scatter an ally's forces right before your Harbinger doom rush -- can be the difference between winning and losing.

- **Use the Nightgaunt opening to punish greedy players.** Summoning a Nightgaunt as your first action and flying it into an opponent's Gate-building path forces them to waste Power or get captured. This is devastating against less experienced players or anyone going for a greedy 3-Gate opening.

- **The 3-Gate opening is powerful but risky.** If you can get three Gates on Turn 1 using Flight, you enter Turn 2 with 12+ Power and a spellbook. But you will paint a massive target on yourself. Only attempt this when the faction mix allows it.

- **One Acolyte + one Nightgaunt + one Flying Polyp is a surprisingly strong Gate defense.** No single monster can threaten this setup thanks to Invisibility. Opponents need to commit a GOO or multiple monsters, which is expensive and plays into your Harbinger strategy.

- **Engineer your Harbinger burst from the low 20s in doom.** Aim to be at 20-22 doom, then chain unlimited combat battles against GOOs. Pain yourself into adjacent areas with more GOOs using Madness. Two or three fights can yield 4-6 Elder Signs, which is 5-8+ doom -- enough to close out the game in a single explosive action phase.

- **When the table unites against you, turtle up.** Put Nyarlathotep in a defensible position with multiple cheap units. Invisibility and Emissary make him incredibly hard to kill. Make the cost of attacking you so prohibitive that opponents turn on each other instead.

- **Against Crawling Chaos, the counter-strategy is coordination.** Get all players to agree: always pay for Thousand Forms, target Crawling Chaos Gates, isolate Nyarlathotep, and kill him. Focus on killing Hunting Horrors when they are out of position. Without Nyarlathotep, Crawling Chaos falls apart completely.

- **Use pains as free movement.** From the intermediate/advanced tactics episode: when there is no Madness in play (or you control it), pains are essentially free repositioning. With unlimited combat, you can pain yourself from one fight into the next, chaining battles across the board -- the Train of Pain.

- **Crawling Chaos is the opportunist faction -- prey on the weak, not the strong.** Your faction excels at punishing overextended opponents, not brawling with prepared defenders. Look for isolated Cultists, undefended Gates, and factions that just spent all their Power. If you find yourself attacking into strength, you are playing incorrectly. *(Sandy Petersen)*

- **Thousand Forms is your single most important economic weapon.** Every time an opponent pays to ignore it, that is Power they are not spending on their own plan. Even if nobody ever fails the check, the cumulative drain on opponent Power budgets over a full game is enormous. Never underestimate its passive value. *(community insight)*

- **Flight is the best opening spellbook in most games.** Getting Flight on Turn 1 lets you reach any Gate on the map, enabling the 3-Gate rush or opportunistic Cultist captures. Delay Flight only if you have a very specific reason to take something else first. *(community insight)*

## Frequently Asked Questions

*Common rules questions specific to Crawling Chaos. Sourced from the [official Petersen Games FAQ](https://petersengames.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48000952254) and community rulings.*

### Can Madness redirect pained units to any area on the map, or only adjacent areas?

Madness must obey normal pain/retreat restrictions. Pained units can only be moved to adjacent areas, just like regular pain results. Madness does not let you send units to any arbitrary area on the map. What it does is let you choose which adjacent area each pained unit retreats to, rather than letting the unit's owner decide. This is still extremely powerful for scattering enemy forces.

### Does Flight work for Nyarlathotep, or only for monsters like Nightgaunts?

Flight applies to all of your units, including Nyarlathotep, all your monsters, and even your Cultists. Every unit in the Crawling Chaos faction can fly over up to two areas containing enemy units during a move action. This is a faction-wide ability, not restricted to any specific unit type.

### Can Emissary of the Outer Gods protect Nyarlathotep against elimination effects?

Emissary specifically converts kill results into pain results when no enemy Great Old One is involved in the battle. It does not protect against elimination effects that occur outside of battle (such as abilities that directly eliminate units without a combat roll). If an effect simply eliminates Nyarlathotep without a battle taking place, Emissary does not apply.

### How does Harbinger placement work -- are there restrictions on choosing Elder Signs vs Power?

When Harbinger triggers (an enemy Great Old One is pained or killed in a battle where Nyarlathotep is present), you receive Power equal to half the cost to awaken that GOO. For each enemy GOO affected, you may choose to take 2 Elder Signs instead of the Power. This choice is made per GOO, so if two GOOs are pained in the same battle, you can take Elder Signs from one and Power from the other. Harbinger triggers even if Nyarlathotep himself is killed or pained in the same battle.

### Can you use Seek and Destroy if you have no Hunting Horrors on the map?

No. Seek and Destroy moves Hunting Horrors that are currently on the map into the battle area. If both Hunting Horrors are in your unit pool (not yet summoned or previously killed), there are no valid targets for the ability and it does nothing. You need at least one Hunting Horror deployed somewhere on the map for Seek and Destroy to have an effect.

### Does Thousand Forms let Nyarlathotep use any monster's ability or copy faction powers?

No. Thousand Forms is not a shape-shifting or ability-copying power. It is a zero-cost action that rolls a d6 to drain Power from your opponents (or gain Power yourself if they cannot pay). The name is thematic, but the mechanical effect is purely economic. It has nothing to do with copying other units' abilities.

### Does Madness determine which units retreat, or just where they go?

Madness only determines the destination of pained units -- it does not let you choose which enemy units receive pain results. The normal combat resolution determines which units are pained (the owning player assigns their pain results to their own units as usual). You then choose which adjacent area each pained unit retreats to, and you choose the order of all pain retreats.

### Can Invisibility exempt a Great Old One from battle?

No. Invisibility allows you to select one monster or Cultist per Flying Polyp present and exempt them from the battle. Great Old Ones are neither monsters nor Cultists, so they cannot be targeted by Invisibility. This means Invisibility is best used to strip away an enemy's strongest monsters before dice are rolled, leaving their GOO more exposed.

### Does Nyarlathotep's combat count both players' spellbooks even in multi-faction battles?

Nyarlathotep's combat dice equal the total of your spellbooks plus your opponent's spellbooks. In a standard one-on-one battle, this is straightforward. In situations where multiple factions have units in the area, Nyarlathotep counts only the spellbooks of the specific faction he is fighting. The maximum is 12 dice (6 of yours plus 6 of theirs).
