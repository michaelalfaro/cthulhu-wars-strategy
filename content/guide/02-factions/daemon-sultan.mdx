# Daemon Sultan

## Overview

Daemon Sultan is the most Machiavellian faction in Cthulhu Wars -- a relentless engine faction that combines cheap Gate construction, unparalleled stalling power, and devastating social engineering into a package that can outpace almost anyone in Doom if left unchecked. As the host of Opening the Way puts it, if Tcho-Tcho and Daemon Sultan are in a Doom race and nobody intervenes, Daemon Sultan wins that race 100% of the time.

The faction revolves around three Great Old Ones -- Avatar Thesis, Avatar Antithesis, and Avatar Synthesis -- each representing a different aspect of the blind idiot god Azathoth. This makes Daemon Sultan the only faction in the game with three GOOs, eclipsing even Yellow Sign and Windwalker's two. Three GOOs means three Elder Signs from a single Ritual, and even on just one Gate, that can generate five to seven Doom in a single Doom phase. A three-Gate Daemon Sultan can easily hit ten Doom in one phase. That kind of output is, frankly, obscene.

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Playstyle:** Engine-building, stalling, social engineering
**Home Area:** Variable (first Psychosis placement becomes your starting area)
**Unique Faction Ability:** Psychosis -- Zero-cost action. Select an area with no units from any faction and place an Acolyte from your pool there. Your first Psychosis placement becomes your starting area.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

Daemon Sultan is the ultimate stalling faction. Its entire game plan revolves around many different combinations of zero-cost and one-cost actions that let you drag your feet while opponents burn through their Power. A good Daemon Sultan player is hard to predict because the sheer number of tools available creates an enormous decision tree each action phase. With all Spellbooks online, Daemon Sultan can adapt to virtually any situation that arises in the mid to late game.

**Core Philosophy:** Stall, build cheap Gates, get all three GOOs online, then Ritual every Doom phase while using social engineering to keep opponents focused on each other rather than on you. Daemon Sultan thrives when the other players are set against each other and you are uncontained -- you can quickly explode in Doom, Gates, and Elder Signs.

**Strengths:**
- Three Great Old Ones generate massive Doom from Rituals (three Elder Signs per Ritual)
- Chaos Gates let you build Gates for just 1 Power instead of the standard 3, giving you an enormous economic advantage
- Psychosis provides free zero-cost actions for placing Acolytes, enabling incredible stalling
- Variable-cost GOO awakening (Thesis/Antithesis) allows creative Power management and recovery
- Cosmic Ruler on Avatar Synthesis lets you redirect kills to your cheapest GOO, making your board presence extremely resilient
- Social engineering tools (Traders, awakening gifts of Doom/Elder Signs/Power) let you bribe allies and punish enemies
- Best stalling toolkit of any faction in the game -- numerous one-cost and zero-cost actions per phase

**Weaknesses:**
- Total lack of a multi-space movement ability (no equivalent to Flight, Avatar, or He Who Is Not to Be Named)
- Must spend at least 19 Power across the game to get all three GOOs and larvae into play
- Vulnerable to coordinated aggression -- if opponents ally against you, they can capture your Acolytes and deny you Gates
- Larvae roll zero combat dice until their matching Avatar is in play, making them fragile early on
- Weak in direct combat against deathball factions like Great Cthulhu or Windwalker
- Players who struggle with table talk and deal-making will have a harder time leveraging the faction's social tools

## Spellbook Abilities

All six Daemon Sultan Spellbooks share a critical mechanic: each one flips face down after use, and can only be used once per action phase. During each Doom phase, all face-down Spellbooks flip back up. This creates a satisfying puzzle of optimizing which books to use each phase and in what order.

### Chaos Gate
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement
**Effect:** One-cost action. Flip this Spellbook face down, then place a Chaos Gate in any area without a Gate. Chaos Gates can only be constructed by or occupied by Daemon Sultan Cultists. Otherwise they function like a normal Gate, except they can only be placed via this Spellbook. During the Doom phase, an abandoned Chaos Gate is exchanged for a normal Gate.
**Strategic notes:** This is the signature Spellbook of the Daemon Sultan faction and should almost always be your first or second book. Building a Gate for 1 Power instead of 3 is a massive economic advantage. Combined with Consummation, you can build two Chaos Gates in a single action phase for just 3 Power over three actions. Opponents cannot occupy your Chaos Gates with their own Cultists, so if they capture your Acolyte off a Chaos Gate, it simply becomes abandoned and converts to a normal Gate next Doom phase -- which often fulfills the abandoned Gate Spellbook requirement for free. Early Chaos Gate access lets you start action phase three with four or even five Gates, giving you the Power base you need to awaken your remaining GOOs.

### Animate Matter
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement
**Effect:** One-cost action. Flip this Spellbook face down, then move a controlled Chaos Gate from its area to an adjacent area, taking its Cultist along. You cannot move the Gate into another player's start area. If the new area has an existing physical Gate, replace that Gate with the Chaos Gate.
**Strategic notes:** This is Daemon Sultan's punishment tool. Gates are expensive for everyone else -- they cost 3 Power to build -- and you can just erase them by sliding a Chaos Gate into their space. You cannot move into start areas (otherwise this would be completely broken), but it is still devastating against opponents who build Gates outside their home territory. Any faction that is ahead of you in Doom, Gates, or Elder Signs is a great target. Animate Matter also provides repositioning flexibility, letting you move a Chaos Gate and its Cultist to a safer location. Combined with your stalling ability, you can wait until opponents run out of Power and then blow up their Gates when they cannot respond.

### Traders
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement
**Effect:** One-cost action. Flip this Spellbook face down, then replace your controlled Chaos Gate with a normal Gate, and replace its controlling Cultist with another player's Cultist from their pool. Your Cultist returns to your pool. If you have no other units in the area, gain an Elder Sign.
**Strategic notes:** Traders is one of the most versatile Spellbooks in the entire game. It gives you Doom (Elder Sign), it gives you another stall (your Cultist goes back to pool for Psychosis), and it can be used defensively -- if someone moves in to capture your undefended Chaos Gate Acolyte, you can use Traders first to convert the Gate to normal, place someone else's Cultist there, get your Acolyte back to safety, and earn a free Elder Sign. Now there is a normal Gate for other players to fight over, creating conflict that draws attention away from you. As a social engineering tool, Traders is incredible: you can gift a Gate to the weakest faction (risk-free goodwill), beef up the strongest faction to make them a bigger target for everyone else, or keep an alliance intact. One often-overlooked detail: Traders replaces your Cultist with another player's "Cultist" -- not specifically an Acolyte. This means you can place a High Priest from another player's pool, effectively gifting them two free Power and a Gate. That is an outstanding bribe.

### Undirected Energy
**Unlock condition:** Awaken Avatar Thesis (take this Spellbook when Thesis is awakened)
**Effect:** One-cost action. Flip this Spellbook face down if Avatar Thesis is in play. Gain 1 Power per faction with units in Thesis' area, including yours.
**Strategic notes:** At minimum, this Spellbook is a free stall -- you pay 1 Power and gain 1 Power back because your own faction counts. But the real power is how it scales with crowding. If two or three factions share the area with Thesis, you are gaining net Power while stalling. This pairs beautifully with Traders, which creates conflict and incentivizes opponents to pile into contested areas. Position Thesis in high-traffic zones to maximize the return. Take this Spellbook when you first awaken Thesis, typically in action phase two.

### Consummation
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement
**Effect:** One-cost action. Flip this Spellbook face down, then flip one of your other face-down faction Spellbooks face up again, permitting it to be reused this action phase.
**Strategic notes:** Consummation is simple but extremely flexible. It lets you use any of your other five Spellbooks a second time in the same action phase. Double Chaos Gate (two Gates for 3 Power total) is the classic move in the early game. Double Animate Matter is devastating if you want to punish an opponent by blowing up two Gates in one phase. Double Undirected Energy in a crowded area can generate significant free Power. Double Fiendish Growth lets you rapidly reinforce a position. Think carefully about what book you want to repeat each phase -- the optimal choice changes based on the board state. This should usually be your first or second Spellbook alongside Chaos Gate.

### Fiendish Growth
**Unlock condition:** Awaken Avatar Antithesis (take this Spellbook when Antithesis is awakened)
**Effect:** One-cost action. Flip this Spellbook face down if Avatar Antithesis is in play. Place one free monster or Acolyte from your pool in Avatar Antithesis' area per faction with units in the area, including yours.
**Strategic notes:** Fiendish Growth is your rapid reinforcement tool. Like Undirected Energy, it scales with the number of factions present in the area. At minimum you place one free unit; in a crowded area you can drop two or three. This is excellent for quickly defending a position -- march Antithesis onto a Gate, use Fiendish Growth to summon matching larvae and maybe an Acolyte, and suddenly the position is fortified. It is particularly strong in the late game when opponents are out of Power: you stall them out, then move Antithesis onto their Gate and instantly garrison it. Placing Acolytes this way also restocks your Psychosis fuel.

## Units

### Cultists (Acolytes)
**Cost:** 1 Power (recruit) or 0 Power (Psychosis into empty areas)
**Combat:** 0
**Count:** 6
**Tactical role:** Daemon Sultan Acolytes are fundamentally different from other factions' Cultists because of Psychosis. Every Acolyte in your pool is a free zero-cost stalling action waiting to happen -- as long as there are empty areas on the map. Expect your Acolytes to get captured frequently; this is normal and even desirable in some situations. Getting Acolytes killed in battle puts them back in your pool (enabling more Psychosis stalls), whereas getting captured locks them away until next action phase and denies you Gates. Do not be afraid to declare battles just to get your own Acolytes killed and returned to pool. Chaos Gates let you get Acolytes onto Gates cheaply, and Traders lets you swap them to safety. Your Acolytes are not precious -- they are fuel for the engine.

### Larvae (Larva Thesis, Larva Antithesis, Larva Synthesis)
**Cost:** 1 Power each to summon
**Combat:** 0 normally; 2 combat when their matching Avatar GOO is in play
**Count:** 2 of each type (6 total)
**Tactical role:** Larvae are Daemon Sultan's only monster units. They serve two essential purposes: they are prerequisites for awakening their matching Avatar GOO (you must have the larva in play to awaken the Avatar, which then replaces it), and they are Gate defenders once their Avatar is active. At zero combat without their Avatar, larvae are comparable to Ghouls -- adequate for sitting on a Gate but not much else. Once the matching Avatar is in play, they become solid two-dice combatants. Summoning one of each type (3 Power total) is a Spellbook requirement, so you will need all three types in play at some point. You generally summon Larva Thesis first in action phase one to guard your first Gate and set up the Thesis awakening for action phase two.

### Avatar Thesis (Great Old One)
**Cost:** Variable (0 to 8 Power). Set the Azathoth marker on the Doom Track to any position between 0 and 8, then pay Power equal to that setting. Each other player gains 1 Power, or an enemy player of your choice gains 2 Power. Requires Larva Thesis in play (replaces the larva).
**Combat:** Equal to the Azathoth marker's position (0 to 8 dice)
**Count:** 1
**Tactical role:** Thesis is your first GOO and the entry point to your entire Avatar chain. Its variable cost is one of the most unique mechanics in Cthulhu Wars. A zero-cost Thesis is phenomenal in action phase two -- you get a free GOO on the board while everyone else spends their whole phase summoning theirs. A zero-cost Thesis rolls zero combat dice but can still capture undefended Acolytes by simply moving in and declaring battle. Against engine factions with weak combat (Tcho-Tcho, Yellow Sign, Ancients), a cheap Thesis can roam around stealing Gates early. Against fight factions, you may want to invest 3-4 Power so Thesis can at least defend itself. The Azathoth marker position you set for Thesis also determines Antithesis' cost (8 minus the marker), so plan both awakenings together. Thesis is also the GOO you most often sacrifice via Cosmic Ruler, since reawakening it lets you reset the Azathoth marker to any position, which in turn resets Antithesis' combat dice.

### Avatar Antithesis (Great Old One)
**Cost:** 8 minus the Azathoth marker's position. Avatar Thesis must have been awakened previously (need not be in play). Each other player gains 1 Doom, or choose an enemy player who gains 1 Elder Sign. Requires Larva Antithesis in play (replaces the larva).
**Combat:** Equal to 8 minus the Azathoth marker's position (inverse of Thesis)
**Count:** 1
**Tactical role:** Antithesis is the inverse of Thesis in both cost and combat. If you paid 0 for Thesis, Antithesis costs 8 and rolls 8 dice (a formidable combatant). If you paid 8 for Thesis, Antithesis is free but rolls nothing. The awakening gift of 1 Doom to all players or 1 Elder Sign to a chosen player is a powerful social engineering tool. You can boost someone who has fallen behind, reward an ally for not attacking you, or diplomatically give everyone 1 Doom so nobody feels singled out. Antithesis pairs with Fiendish Growth for rapid area reinforcement. Its combat dice are always the complement of Thesis' dice, so between the two you always have 8 total combat dice distributed however you chose.

### Avatar Synthesis (Great Old One / Azathoth)
**Cost:** 8 Power. Both Thesis and Antithesis must have been awakened previously (need not be in play). Roll the Azathoth die (d6+2, result 3-8). All enemies have two minutes to collectively decide how to lose that much combined Power and/or Doom. If they cannot agree, you win the game. In 2-3 player games, the roll is rounded up. Requires Larva Synthesis in play (replaces the larva).
**Combat:** Roll the Azathoth die (d6+2), then roll that many combat dice (minimum 3, maximum 8)
**Count:** 1
**Tactical role:** Synthesis is the ultimate social engineering mechanic ever implemented in Cthulhu Wars. The awakening requirement alone -- forcing opponents to collectively lose Power/Doom or hand you the win -- is like Thousand Forms and Groth on steroids. If your opponents are spiteful enough to refuse to cooperate, the game simply ends and you win. This has happened in actual play. Beyond the awakening shock, Synthesis grants Cosmic Ruler: when any Avatar is chosen to receive a Kill or Elimination, you may instead eliminate a different Avatar from anywhere on the map. This means you always sacrifice whichever GOO is cheapest to re-awaken (typically a zero-cost Thesis or Antithesis), giving you effectively two extra lives at all times. Protect Synthesis at all costs -- it is the keystone of your late-game resilience. Losing Synthesis forces you to spend 8 Power to re-awaken it, which can be game-ending.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

### Action Phase 1: Setup and Foundation

Daemon Sultan starts with 4 Power and no units on the map. Your first six actions will be Psychosis placements.

1. **Psychosis** (0 Power) -- Place your first Acolyte. This becomes your starting area. Choose based on faction composition: if fight factions (Cthulhu, Windwalker, Crawling Chaos) dominate, place far away from them. If engine factions (Tcho-Tcho, Yellow Sign, Ancients) are present, consider placing close to or even adjacent to them.
2. **Psychosis** (0 Power) x5 -- Place your remaining five Acolytes across empty areas on the map. Spread out to claim territory and set up future Chaos Gate locations.
3. **Build Gate** (3 Power) -- Build your Gate at your starting area.
4. **Summon Larva Thesis** (1 Power) -- Place Larva Thesis at your Gate to defend it. This is essential setup for awakening Avatar Thesis in action phase two.

You end action phase one with 0 Power, six Acolytes on the map, one Gate, and one Larva Thesis guarding it.

**Gather Power:** You should collect around 8 Power (6 Acolytes + 1 Gate + potential bonus from Spellbook requirement).

**First Doom Phase:** Take the free Spellbook requirement where each other player chooses to gain 1 Power or 1 Doom, and you gain everything they gain. Most players take the Power, giving you 10-11 Power heading into action phase two. Take **Chaos Gate** as your first Spellbook.

### Action Phase 2: First GOO and Expansion

With approximately 10-11 Power, you have three major paths depending on the faction mix at the table:

**Path A -- Cheap Thesis + Multiple Gates (vs. engine factions):**
1. Awaken Avatar Thesis for 0 Power (set Azathoth marker to 0). Take **Undirected Energy**.
2. Use Thesis to roam and capture enemy Acolytes from engine factions with weak combat.
3. Build a Chaos Gate (1 Power) and potentially use Consummation for a second Chaos Gate (2 more Power for the Consummation + second Chaos Gate).
4. End the phase on 3-5 Gates heading into action phase three with enormous Power income.

**Path B -- Double GOO Awakening (vs. fight factions):**
1. Summon Larva Antithesis (1 Power).
2. Awaken Avatar Thesis for 3-4 Power (balanced dice split). Take **Undirected Energy**.
3. Awaken Avatar Antithesis for 4-5 Power. Take a Spellbook.
4. You now have two GOOs with moderate combat, making you resilient against incoming aggression. You may still have enough Power for one Chaos Gate.

**Path C -- Larva Rush + Chaos Gates (safe option):**
1. Summon the two remaining larva types (2 Power) to fulfill the "one of each larva in play" Spellbook requirement. Take **Consummation**.
2. Awaken Avatar Thesis cheaply (0-2 Power). Take another Spellbook.
3. Build one or two Chaos Gates using your remaining Power.
4. End the phase with solid Gate income and most Spellbooks collected.

### Action Phase 3: Synthesis Push

Your top priority this phase is awakening Avatar Synthesis if you have the 8 Power required.

1. **Summon Larva Synthesis** (1 Power) if not already in play.
2. **Awaken Avatar Synthesis** (8 Power). This hurts opponents by forcing them to collectively lose Power/Doom equal to your Azathoth die roll. Take your remaining Spellbook.
3. With leftover Power, use your Spellbooks to stall, build Chaos Gates, and maintain your Gate count.
4. If you cannot afford Synthesis yet, focus on awakening Antithesis (if you have not already) and building Gates so you have the 8 Power next phase.

## Early Game (Action Phases 1-2)

**Primary Goals:**
- Place all six Acolytes via Psychosis across the map
- Build your first Gate and protect it with Larva Thesis
- Take the free Doom phase Spellbook requirement to boost your Power
- Acquire Chaos Gate as your first Spellbook
- Awaken Avatar Thesis (ideally in action phase two)
- Begin building Chaos Gates to rapidly expand your Power base

**Key Principles:**
- Your first action phase is essentially scripted: Psychosis all Acolytes, build a Gate, summon Larva Thesis. Do not deviate.
- Position your starting area based on the table composition. Against fighters, distance is your friend. Against engines, proximity lets you pressure them with cheap Thesis captures.
- Do not panic when opponents capture your Acolytes. This is expected and normal. Every captured Acolyte comes back next action phase, and the abandoned Gate Spellbook requirement is essentially free because of this.
- Use the free Doom phase Spellbook requirement strategically. Most of the time, let everyone gain Power -- you need the 10-11 Power to fund action phase two. However, if Crawling Chaos is in the game, consider whether giving them their 11th Power lets them awaken Nyarlathotep and use Thousand Forms in the same phase.

## Mid Game (Action Phases 3-4)

**Transition Strategy:**
- Get Avatar Synthesis online as soon as possible. This is your top priority. Synthesis gives you Cosmic Ruler (redirect kills to your cheapest GOO) and forces opponents to lose Power/Doom on awakening.
- Once all three GOOs are in play, you should be Ritualing every single Doom phase. Even on one Gate with three GOOs, you earn five to seven Doom per Ritual.
- Use your Spellbooks as one-cost stalling actions. Each phase you can potentially take six one-cost actions (one per Spellbook) plus Psychosis zero-cost actions. This lets you outlast opponents consistently.
- Maintain two to three Gates. More is better, but even one Gate plus three GOOs generates devastating Doom output.
- Use Traders to set up rivalries and conflict between opponents, drawing attention away from yourself.

**Social Engineering:**
- Every GOO awakening is an opportunity to make friends or enemies. Thesis gives opponents Power; Antithesis gives Doom or Elder Signs; Synthesis forces collective Power/Doom loss.
- Reward players who leave you alone. Punish players who attack you. Be explicit about this at the table.
- Use Traders to gift Gates to allies or position normal Gates where opponents will fight over them.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

**Closing Out the Game:**
- Daemon Sultan wins by Ritualing repeatedly with three GOOs and multiple Gates. Your Doom output per phase is among the highest in the game.
- Use Cosmic Ruler to absorb attacks. When opponents kill an Avatar, redirect the kill to your cheapest GOO (often a zero-cost Thesis). Reawaken it cheaply and you are right back in the game.
- The critical recovery trick: if Thesis was awakened at 7-8 Power and then gets killed, the Azathoth marker stays at 7-8. You can reawaken Antithesis for 0-1 Power, then reawaken Thesis for 0 Power (resetting the marker). Now Antithesis is suddenly rolling 7-8 combat dice, and you have two GOOs back for nearly zero Power. This can be the difference between winning and losing.
- Keep Synthesis alive at all costs. You always have two lives to burn (Thesis and Antithesis via Cosmic Ruler) before Synthesis is threatened. Never lose Synthesis if you can avoid it.
- Continue building Chaos Gates each phase. A three-Gate Daemon Sultan can easily generate ten Doom per Doom phase. This is game-winning output.

**Endgame Defense:**
- Your resilience comes from Cosmic Ruler and cheap GOO reawakening, not from raw combat dice. You will not win slugfests against Cthulhu deathballs or Windwalker armies, but you can absorb hits and recover faster than anyone.
- Stall opponents out of Power, then act. Move GOOs onto their Gates, use Fiendish Growth to garrison them, and capture.
- If opponents coordinate against you, use your social tools aggressively -- gift Elder Signs, promise Traders Gates, threaten Animate Matter destruction. Make it more costly to attack you than to attack someone else.

## Power Combos & Synergies

**Chaos Gate + Consummation:** Two Gates for 3 Power over three actions. This is your bread-and-butter economic engine. Use this every action phase in the early game to rapidly expand your Gate count.

**Cosmic Ruler + Cheap Thesis/Antithesis Reawakening:** The core resilience combo. Let opponents kill your cheapest GOO via Cosmic Ruler, then reawaken it for 0 Power. You effectively have infinite GOO lives as long as Synthesis stays alive. Reawakening Thesis also resets the Azathoth marker, letting you redistribute combat dice between Thesis and Antithesis.

**Traders + Psychosis:** When you use Traders, your Acolyte returns to your pool, immediately enabling another Psychosis stall. This creates a recurring loop: place Acolyte via Psychosis, build Chaos Gate, use Traders to convert it, Acolyte returns to pool, Psychosis again next phase.

**Undirected Energy + Crowded Areas:** Position Thesis in high-traffic zones where multiple factions have units. Undirected Energy nets you free Power scaling with the number of factions present. Use Traders to create conflict in those areas, drawing more factions in.

**Fiendish Growth + Late-Game Captures:** When opponents are out of Power, march Antithesis onto their Gate and use Fiendish Growth to instantly garrison it with larvae and Acolytes. The position is defended before they can respond next action phase.

**Animate Matter + Stalling:** Wait until opponents are out of Power, then blow up their Gates with Animate Matter. They cannot rebuild until next action phase, costing them Doom and Power income. Combined with Consummation, you can destroy two Gates in one phase.

**Social Engineering Stack:** Thesis awakening gifts Power. Antithesis awakening gifts Doom or an Elder Sign. Traders gifts a Gate (potentially with a High Priest). Layer these gifts onto the same player to build a strong alliance, or spread them around to keep everyone happy. Conversely, threaten Animate Matter against anyone who attacks you.

## Factions to Watch Out For

**Crawling Chaos:** Your single most dangerous opponent. Harbinger lets Nyarlathotep hunt GOOs that do not roll many dice, and your Avatars are prime targets. Crawling Chaos also has strong mobility via Flight, letting them reach your positions quickly. Do not use your free Doom phase Spellbook requirement if it gives Crawling Chaos the Power to both awaken and use Thousand Forms in the same phase. Unless you can strike a deal with this faction, treat them as an existential threat.

**Great Cthulhu:** Their combat deathball can obliterate your positions, and your Avatars will never match their raw dice output. Distance is your best defense. If Cthulhu is in the game, set up far away and use Chaos Gates to expand in the opposite direction.

**Windwalker:** Highly mobile and combat-heavy. Windwalker can reach your positions quickly and overwhelm your relatively low combat dice. Like Cthulhu, avoid direct confrontation and rely on stalling and resilience via Cosmic Ruler.

**Coordinated Opponents:** Daemon Sultan's biggest weakness is not any single faction -- it is multiple factions working together to capture your Acolytes and deny you Gates. Preventing this coordination through social engineering is your most important meta-game skill.

## Matchups

### vs Great Cthulhu
Cthulhu's raw combat power is terrifying for a faction that never rolls more than eight dice on any single GOO. Set up far away if possible, build Chaos Gates in the opposite direction, and rely on Cosmic Ruler to absorb any hits that come your way. Use social engineering to point Cthulhu at other targets.

### vs Black Goat
Black Goat is an engine faction that needs time to expand, which gives you a natural window to build your own engine in parallel. Their Groth Spellbook is actually beneficial for you -- losing Acolytes to Groth just fuels more Psychosis stalls. Encourage Black Goat players to use Groth. Avoid direct fights with a turtled Shub fortress.

### vs Crawling Chaos
Your most dangerous matchup. Nyarlathotep with Harbinger actively hunts low-combat GOOs, and your Avatars fit that profile perfectly. Do not give Crawling Chaos extra Power from your Doom phase Spellbook requirement unless you are getting significant value in return. Try to negotiate a non-aggression deal; if that fails, keep your GOOs grouped together so they cannot be picked off individually.

### vs Yellow Sign
Yellow Sign is another engine faction, so the game becomes a Doom race. Setting up adjacent to Yellow Sign lets you pressure them with cheap Thesis captures early. Their Desecration can threaten your Gates, but your ability to rebuild cheaply via Chaos Gate mitigates this. Use Traders to create conflict between Yellow Sign and other factions.

### vs Opener of the Way
Opener's high Power costs mean they are slow to get going, which benefits your stalling strategy. However, their combat potential once Yog-Sothoth is online is significant. Use your social engineering to stay off their radar. A well-timed Traders gift can keep Opener focused on other targets while you build your engine quietly.

### vs Sleeper
Sleeper's Lethargy hoarding strategy means they will often have Power when others do not, making them harder to stall out. However, Sleeper is typically passive in the early game, giving you time to expand and awaken your GOOs without interference. Keep an eye on their late-game Tsathoggua, which can be combat-heavy.

### vs Windwalker
Windwalker's mobility and Ithaqua deathball are serious threats. Do not let them catch your GOOs isolated. Keep your Avatars grouped on defended Gates and use Cosmic Ruler to absorb any attacks. If Windwalker is focusing on other targets, exploit the distraction to build Gates and Ritual aggressively.

### vs Tcho-Tcho
Tcho-Tcho accumulates Doom quickly if uncontested, but their combat is relatively weak. Setting up near Tcho-Tcho and using a cheap Thesis to capture their Acolytes early is a strong play. Your stalling toolkit outpaces theirs, and Chaos Gates let you build an economic advantage they cannot match.

### vs Ancients
Ancients play a defensive, area-control style that does not directly threaten Daemon Sultan. Both factions are engine-oriented, so the game becomes a Doom race. Use Animate Matter to threaten their Gate positions if they pull ahead, and leverage Traders to create conflict between Ancients and other factions while you quietly ritual.

### vs Bubastis
Bubastis has reactive capabilities that can be unpredictable. Treat them as you would any faction with decent mobility -- protect your Acolytes, maintain strong Gate defenses with larvae, and use your social engineering to stay on their good side. Your three-GOO Ritual output should outpace their Doom generation if you play patiently.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Neglecting to awaken Synthesis as soon as possible.** Synthesis enables Cosmic Ruler, which is your primary defense mechanism. Without it, losing a GOO in combat is far more costly since you cannot redirect kills. Prioritize getting all three GOOs online by action phase three or four at the latest.

2. **Letting Synthesis die.** Synthesis is the keystone. Thesis and Antithesis are your expendable shields via Cosmic Ruler -- always sacrifice them instead. Losing Synthesis costs 8 Power to re-awaken plus the awakening roll that hurts your opponents, and without Cosmic Ruler you are extremely fragile.

3. **Getting greedy with Gates instead of summoning GOOs.** You need to spend 19 Power across the game on larvae and GOO awakenings. Building extra Chaos Gates is tempting, but you need your GOOs to generate Ritual Doom, defend positions, and enable Spellbooks. Do not sacrifice GOO tempo for an extra Gate.

4. **Ignoring social engineering.** Daemon Sultan has more tools for deals, bribes, and threats than any other faction. If you are not actively table-talking -- rewarding allies with Traders Gates and Elder Signs, threatening enemies with Animate Matter -- you are leaving your strongest weapon unused.

5. **Panicking when Acolytes get captured.** Losing Acolytes is a normal part of playing Daemon Sultan. They come back next action phase, abandoned Gates fulfill a Spellbook requirement, and your pool refilling enables more Psychosis stalls. Do not overcommit Power to defend Acolytes.

6. **Forgetting that Psychosis requires empty areas.** In higher player-count games, the map fills up quickly, reducing the number of empty areas available for Psychosis. Be mindful of this -- your stalling toolkit becomes less effective when the map is congested with units from many factions.

7. **Setting the Azathoth marker without planning both GOO awakenings.** The marker position determines both Thesis' and Antithesis' cost and combat dice. Think about what you need from both GOOs before committing to a number. A 4/4 split gives moderate dice on both; a 0/8 split gives you one free GOO and one powerhouse.

8. **Using the Doom phase Spellbook requirement carelessly.** Giving every player 1 Power is usually correct, but against Crawling Chaos it can fund a devastating Nyarlathotep + Thousand Forms turn. Evaluate the table state before activating this each Doom phase.

## Tips & Tricks

- **Deliberately lose battles to cycle Acolytes.** If opponents have units in your area and you want your Acolytes back in your pool for Psychosis, declare a battle and let your Acolytes die. Killed units return to your pool; captured ones do not (until next action phase). This counterintuitive tactic fuels your stalling engine.

- **Capturing Daemon Sultan Acolytes is a public service.** If you are playing against Daemon Sultan, capture their Acolytes rather than killing them. Captured Acolytes do not return to pool until next action phase and deny them Gates. Killing Acolytes just gives them more Psychosis fuel.

- **The Cosmic Ruler reset trick is critical.** When Thesis was set high (7-8) and gets killed via Cosmic Ruler, the marker stays at 7-8. Reawaken Antithesis for 0-1 Power, then reawaken Thesis for 0 Power (resetting the marker to 0). Now Antithesis rolls 8 dice and you spent essentially nothing. This recovery loop makes Daemon Sultan nearly impossible to permanently cripple.

- **Occupy empty areas to counter Psychosis.** If you are playing against Daemon Sultan, spread your units across the map to deny them empty areas for Psychosis. In higher player-count games, this happens naturally; in lower player counts, it requires deliberate effort.

- **Target Synthesis when attacking Daemon Sultan.** Cosmic Ruler lets Daemon Sultan redirect kills away from Synthesis, so you need to attack on multiple fronts simultaneously. Ideally, catch their GOOs spread across different Gates -- two GOOs on one Gate and one on another. Hit both positions at once to overwhelm Cosmic Ruler's protection.

- **Place Chaos Gates strategically for Animate Matter.** Remember that Animate Matter cannot move into start areas. Place your Chaos Gates adjacent to opponents' non-start-area Gates so you can threaten to blow them up. This threat alone can deter aggression.

- **Use Traders proactively, not just reactively.** Do not wait for someone to threaten your Chaos Gate. Use Traders when it is strategically advantageous -- gift a Gate to create an alliance, reposition your Acolyte to a safer location, earn a free Elder Sign. The best Daemon Sultan players use Traders every single action phase.

- **You can place a High Priest with Traders.** Traders replaces your Cultist with another player's "Cultist," not specifically an Acolyte. This means if a player has a High Priest in their pool, you can place it on the Gate you are gifting them. Two free Power and a Gate is an exceptional bribe.

- **Always take Chaos Gate and Consummation as your first two Spellbooks.** This combination ensures you can build two Chaos Gates per action phase starting from action phase two, rapidly building the economic base you need for your expensive GOO awakenings.

- **Do not underestimate Daemon Sultan's Doom output.** Even a modest board state of one Gate and three GOOs generates five to seven Doom per Ritual. Three Gates and three GOOs can produce ten or more. If you are playing against this faction, do not let them ritual unchecked -- even one or two uncontested Ritual phases can put them out of reach.

- **Daemon Sultan is the ultimate diplomatic faction.** Your Traders ability and Chaos Gates give you more negotiation currency than any other faction. Every turn you should be making deals -- gifting Gates for alliances, threatening Animate Matter for concessions, and positioning yourself as everyone's preferred trading partner. The best Daemon Sultan players win as much at the negotiating table as on the board. *(Sandy Petersen)*

- **Animate Matter is a deterrent first and a weapon second.** The threat of destroying an opponent's Gate is often more valuable than actually doing it. Once you blow up a Gate, you have spent your Chaos Gate and lost your leverage. Keep the threat alive as long as possible, and only pull the trigger when it directly prevents an opponent from winning or secures your own victory. *(community insight)*

- **Awaken your three Avatars as quickly as possible.** Each Avatar adds an Elder Sign to every Ritual you perform, making your doom output scale dramatically. Delaying Avatar awakenings in favor of Gate expansion is usually a mistake -- one Avatar plus one Gate generates more doom per Ritual than zero Avatars plus three Gates. *(community insight)*

## Frequently Asked Questions

*Common rules questions specific to Daemon Sultan. Sourced from the [official Petersen Games FAQ](https://petersengames.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48000952254).*

### How does the Daemon Sultan's unique Doom Phase work?

Daemon Sultan's Doom phase follows the standard structure, but with unique elements. All six spellbooks flip face up at the start of each Doom phase, resetting your once-per-phase abilities. Your three Great Old Ones each generate an Elder Sign when you perform a Ritual of Annihilation, meaning a single ritual with all three Avatars in play yields three Elder Signs. This makes even a one-Gate ritual generate five to seven doom, which is why Daemon Sultan's ritual output is among the highest in the game.

### Can Nyarlathotep (Daemon Sultan version) copy other factions' abilities?

Daemon Sultan does not have Nyarlathotep. The faction's three Great Old Ones are Avatar Thesis, Avatar Antithesis, and Avatar Synthesis. None of these Avatars copy other factions' abilities. Avatar Thesis provides Undirected Energy (Power generation scaling with nearby factions), Avatar Antithesis provides Fiendish Growth (free unit placement), and Avatar Synthesis provides Cosmic Ruler (redirect kills to your cheapest GOO). Their strengths come from economic efficiency and resilience, not ability copying.

### How do Daemon Sultan's cultist abilities differ from standard cultists?

Daemon Sultan's Acolytes function identically to other factions' Cultists in terms of combat (0 dice), Power generation (1 Power each), and Gate control. What makes them unique is Psychosis, the faction's unique ability, which lets you place an Acolyte from your pool into any empty area on the map as a zero-cost action. This makes Daemon Sultan Acolytes a stalling resource: every Acolyte in your pool is a free action waiting to happen.

### When does the Daemon Sultan's spellbook timing trigger?

Each of Daemon Sultan's six spellbooks is a 1-cost action that flips face down after use. You can only use each spellbook once per action phase. During the Doom phase, all face-down spellbooks flip back up, allowing you to use them again next action phase. Two spellbooks (Undirected Energy and Fiendish Growth) are tied to specific Avatar awakenings and are taken automatically when those Avatars awaken. The other four can be chosen from any available spellbook requirement.

### Does the Daemon Sultan interact with the neutral Azathoth expansion?

Daemon Sultan and the independent Azathoth from the Azathoth neutral expansion are separate game elements. Daemon Sultan's Avatars represent aspects of Azathoth, but they do not mechanically interact with the independent Azathoth Great Old One from the neutral monster pool. Both can be in the same game without conflict. The Azathoth marker on the Doom Track is exclusive to Daemon Sultan and has no connection to the independent Azathoth unit.
