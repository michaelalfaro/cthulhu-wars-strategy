# Yellow Sign

## Overview

Yellow Sign is the classical engine-building faction of Cthulhu Wars. Based on Robert Chambers' 1895 story *The King in Yellow* -- a tale that Lovecraft himself considered the scariest he ever read -- this faction embodies madness, corruption, and an inexorable creeping influence that spreads across the map.

Where Great Cthulhu and Crawling Chaos lean toward combat, and Black Goat sits somewhere in the middle, Yellow Sign is squarely on the doom-loving side of the spectrum. This faction wins by traveling the map with the King in Yellow and his entourage of Undead, placing desecration tokens in specific glyph areas, and converting successful desecrations into Elder Signs once the engine is online. A winning Yellow Sign player might accumulate anywhere from 6 to 12 Elder Signs -- and if they are approaching double digits, the game is almost certainly over for everyone else.

Yellow Sign has two Great Old Ones: the King in Yellow (cheap at 4 Power but zero combat) and Hastur (expensive at 10 Power but devastating in battle). Both need to be on the map simultaneously for the faction to operate at peak efficiency. This faction does not like direct confrontation and does not roll many combat dice, but it has several rattlesnake-like defensive abilities that make opponents think twice before attacking.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate. The core desecration loop is straightforward to learn, but mastering the tempo of when to desecrate versus when to expand Gates, and knowing how to survive once opponents turn their attention toward you, separates good Yellow Sign players from great ones. There is considerably more depth here than the surface-level "move and desecrate" pattern suggests.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

**Core Philosophy:** Yellow Sign is about building an unstoppable doom engine. You are not trying to fight your way to victory -- you are trying to outpace everyone on the doom track through Elder Sign accumulation and well-timed Rituals of Annihilation. Your Great Old Ones serve different purposes: the King in Yellow is your engine piece (Desecrate), and Hastur is your protector, deterrent, and the key that unlocks your Elder Sign generation via Third Eye.

**Strengths:**
- Massive Elder Sign generation through the Desecrate + Third Eye engine
- Extremely cheap units (Undead cost 1 Power each) enable efficient one-cost actions throughout the game
- Passion makes your Cultists deceptively resilient and punishes opponents for killing them
- Two mobile Great Old Ones with Screaming Dead and He Who Is Not To Be Named allow rapid repositioning
- Feast provides supplemental Power income from desecrated areas
- The Hastur hit squad (He Who Is Not To Be Named + Shriek of the Byakhee + Vengeance) can snipe enemy Great Old Ones
- Can win without heavy Gate investment through sheer Elder Sign volume

**Weaknesses:**
- Very low combat dice across most units; you will lose straight-up fights
- The King in Yellow has zero combat and is fragile -- losing him stalls your entire engine
- Hastur costs 10 Power to awaken (and re-awaken), which is punishing
- You need both Great Old Ones on the map simultaneously to run the engine
- Accumulating Elder Signs draws massive political heat from all opponents
- Dependent on reaching specific glyph areas across the map, which opponents can block
- Vulnerable once opponents achieve unlimited combat, as your mobility tricks lose their edge

## Spellbook Abilities

### Passion
**Unlock condition:** Earned via the "Give 3 Doom to another player" Spellbook requirement, or any other available requirement.
**Effect:** Ongoing. When one or more of your Cultists are eliminated by an enemy (kills, captures, anything), gain 1 Power total.
**Strategic notes:** This is arguably one of the top Spellbooks in the entire game -- easily top three. Passion fundamentally changes the calculus of attacking Yellow Sign. Every time an opponent kills or captures one of your Cultists, they are effectively paying you Power. This makes your Gates deceptively hard to take: if you have multiple Cultists spread across Gates, opponents trigger Passion each time they eliminate one. The best use is placing a Cultist alongside your Great Old Ones to absorb kills -- if someone attacks and rolls a kill, you assign it to the Cultist, gain 1 Power, and your Great Old One survives. You might even recruit that same Cultist right back. Note that if multiple Cultists die in a single battle, you only gain 1 Power total, so spreading them out across different areas maximizes your returns. Take this Spellbook early whenever possible.

### Third Eye
**Unlock condition:** Awaken Hastur (take this Spellbook when you awaken Hastur approximately 99% of the time).
**Effect:** Ongoing. If Hastur is in play, the cost of Desecrate is reduced from 2 to 1 Power. If the desecration succeeds, you also gain 1 Elder Sign.
**Strategic notes:** This is your win condition. Without Third Eye, desecrating costs 2 Power and yields no Elder Signs -- it is expensive and inefficient. With Third Eye, every successful desecration costs just 1 Power and generates an Elder Sign. The difference is night and day. A very common mistake among new Yellow Sign players is trying to desecrate before getting Third Eye. Resist the temptation. Wait until Hastur is on the map and you have Third Eye, then start your desecration journey. The one caveat: accumulating many Elder Signs draws enormous political heat. Strategically reveal low-value Elder Signs (ones and twos) face-up to reduce the psychological pressure of having a mysterious pile of face-down tokens. Keep Hastur alive at all costs, because without him Third Eye is offline and your engine shuts down.

### Screaming Dead
**Unlock condition:** Awaken the King in Yellow.
**Effect:** 1-cost action. Move the King in Yellow to an adjacent area. Any Undead in the same area can move with him for free. You may then take a second, different action (cannot be He Who Is Not To Be Named).
**Strategic notes:** This is your bread-and-butter Spellbook -- the signature ability that defines Yellow Sign's gameplay loop. For just 1 Power, you reposition the King plus his entire Undead entourage and then get a bonus action. The typical play is Screaming Dead into a new area, then Desecrate as your second action. But here is a critical insight that separates experienced players: you do not have to take the second action. Sometimes the best play is to just move and stop, spending only 1 Power to reposition while conserving resources. Staggering your Power spending is a major skill in Cthulhu Wars. Other tricks: your second action can be a normal Move, letting the King effectively move twice to escape danger. You can also Move Hastur as the second action to keep your entire force together. Always bring enough Undead (5 plus the King guarantees a successful Desecrate since you cannot roll higher than 6).

### He Who Is Not To Be Named
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement.
**Effect:** 1-cost action. Move Hastur into any area containing a Cultist of any faction. You may then take a second, different action (cannot be Screaming Dead).
**Strategic notes:** This gives Hastur extraordinary global mobility -- any Cultist on the entire map, friend or foe, is a valid teleport destination. Combined with Vengeance, this enables the devastating "Hastur hit squad" play. Use He Who Is Not To Be Named to teleport Hastur to an enemy-occupied area, then use your second action for Shriek of the Byakhee to bring in combat reinforcements, then battle with unlimited combat. The same PSA from Screaming Dead applies: you do not need to spend Power on the second action if it is not advantageous. Be cautious with this ability -- do not teleport Hastur into a situation where he can be killed without good reason, because re-awakening him at 10 Power is backbreaking.

### Zingaya
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement.
**Effect:** 1-cost action. If Undead are in an area with enemy Cultists, transform one enemy Cultist into an Undead (under your control).
**Strategic notes:** This is a criminally underrated Spellbook that most players never use, which is a significant mistake. Zingaya is similar to Cthulhu's Dreams in that it lets you steal Gates by converting the defending Cultist. The play pattern: move an Undead into an area where an opponent has a lone Cultist on a Gate, Zingaya the Cultist into an Undead, then recruit one of your own Cultists there to take the Gate. This works especially well late in the action phase when opponents are out of Power and cannot respond. It is a one-cost action, which fits perfectly into Yellow Sign's efficient, low-cost action economy. Special note: Zingaya targets "enemy Cultists," which includes Bubastis Earth Cats. If the cats are harassing you, start converting them into Undead. This Spellbook is essential for the "skeleton crew" fallback strategy when your Great Old Ones have been killed.

### Shriek of the Byakhee
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement.
**Effect:** 1-cost action. Move any or all Byakhee from their current areas to one selected area, regardless of distance.
**Strategic notes:** A versatile teleportation ability that lets you instantly concentrate your Byakhee anywhere on the map. This scales well with larger player counts and bigger maps, since distance is irrelevant. Defensively, use it to reinforce the King in Yellow when he is threatened. Offensively, it is a key component of the Hastur hit squad: after teleporting Hastur with He Who Is Not To Be Named, use Shriek of the Byakhee as your second action to bring 3-4 Byakhee into the battle area, giving you 9-12 total combat dice. At only 1 Power, this is remarkably efficient for the amount of force it projects.

## Units

### Cultists (Acolytes)
- **Cost:** 1 Power to recruit
- **Combat:** 0
- **Count:** 6
- **Role:** Yellow Sign cares less about Cultists than most factions, and that is actually a strength. Thanks to Passion, your Cultists function as Power batteries -- opponents pay you every time they kill or capture one. Place them alongside Great Old Ones to absorb kills. Spread them across Gates to make capture expensive (each separate capture event triggers Passion). Use them to hold desecrated areas for Feast income. Late game, having Cultists in your pool is actually useful because you can recruit them anywhere you have a unit, making them instantly deployable after being captured.

### Undead
- **Cost:** 1 Power to summon
- **Combat:** Number of Undead in the battle minus 1 (so 1 Undead = 0 dice, 2 = 1 die, 3 = 2 dice, etc.)
- **Count:** 6
- **Role:** The backbone of Yellow Sign's strategy. At just 1 Power each, Undead represent the cheapest possible actions you can take. They travel with the King for free via Screaming Dead, improving desecration odds -- you need more total units in the area than your die roll. Five Undead plus the King (6 total units) guarantees success since you cannot roll higher than 6. Leave one Undead behind in a desecrated area to trigger Feast. Their combat is mediocre individually but decent in groups. In the "skeleton crew" strategy, Undead become your primary pieces for Zingaya-based Gate stealing when your Great Old Ones are down. Always summon them from areas with Gates, then pick them up with Screaming Dead.

### Byakhee
- **Cost:** 2 Power to summon
- **Combat:** Number of Byakhee in the battle plus 1 (so 1 Byakhee = 2 dice, 2 = 3 dice, etc.)
- **Count:** 4
- **Role:** Yellow Sign's most expensive monster at 2 Power, though that is still cheap by game standards. Byakhee are your primary combat units and the muscle behind the Hastur hit squad. Their combat scaling rewards concentrating them together. Via Shriek of the Byakhee, they can teleport anywhere on the map instantly. Use them defensively to protect the King or offensively to pile into a battle alongside Hastur. When placing a unit from a failed Desecrate, consider placing a Byakhee -- the extra combat presence in the area can deter attacks while you attempt to Desecrate again.

### King in Yellow (Great Old One)
- **Cost:** 4 Power to awaken
- **Combat:** 0
- **Awakening Requirements:** Must have a unit in an area without a Gate. Pay 4 Power; the King appears in that area.
- **Role:** The King is the heart of your engine. His Desecrate ability is what the entire faction revolves around: for 1-2 Power (depending on Third Eye), roll a die against your total units in the area. If you roll equal to or less than your unit count, place a desecration token. Whether you succeed or fail, place a monster or Cultist costing 2 or less. The King has zero combat, which means he is completely reliant on his entourage for protection. Never leave the King exposed without Undead, Byakhee, or at minimum a Cultist to absorb hits. He costs only 4 Power to awaken, which is a significant advantage -- you can get him out in Turn 1, and re-awakening him is far less painful than re-awakening Hastur. Rule of thumb: place Byakhee on failed Desecrates (you will stay to try again), and place Undead on successful ones (they can travel with the King to the next area).

### Hastur (Great Old One)
- **Cost:** 10 Power to awaken
- **Combat:** Equal to the current cost of a Ritual of Annihilation
- **Awakening Requirements:** Must have a controlled Gate and the King in Yellow in the same area. Pay 10 Power.
- **Role:** Hastur is your protector, deterrent, and engine enabler. His combat dice scale with the Ritual cost (starting at 5 and increasing), making him increasingly dangerous as the game progresses. His Vengeance ability (post-battle: choose which combat results apply to which enemy unit) makes him a genuine rattlesnake -- opponents who bring their Great Old Ones into a fight with Hastur will likely lose them. This discourages attacks even when opponents have the dice advantage. Hastur must be in play for Third Eye to function, making him essential to your Elder Sign engine. Losing Hastur is devastating both because of the 10-Power re-awakening cost and because your Elder Sign generation stops. Keep him alive at all costs. Pair him with the King and Undead in one large group when possible for maximum protection.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

### Opening A: Standard Opening (Recommended for beginners)

**Turn 1 (Action Phase 1):**
1. Move 1 Cultist from Europe to Arabia (1 Power). Arabia has the claw/scratching glyph, setting you up for your first Desecrate, and is adjacent to Africa's chevron glyph areas.
2. Awaken the King in Yellow in Arabia (4 Power). You have a unit in an area without a Gate -- the requirement is met.
3. Build a Gate in Arabia with a remaining Cultist or recruit one there (3 Power).
4. Total spent: 8 Power. You end Turn 1 with the King at a Gate in Arabia, ready to awaken Hastur next turn.

**Turn 2 (Action Phase 2):**
1. You have approximately 10 Power (8 base from Cultists/Gates).
2. Awaken Hastur in Arabia (10 Power). The King and a controlled Gate are in the same area. Take Third Eye as your Spellbook.
3. You are now out of Power, but the engine is online.

**Turn 3 (Action Phase 3):**
1. You have approximately 10 Power again.
2. Begin the Screaming Dead + Desecrate loop. Move the King (with Undead) and Desecrate in the claw glyph area. Earn your first Desecrate Spellbook.
3. Continue moving toward East Africa to Desecrate in a chevron glyph area.
4. Start accumulating Elder Signs with every successful Desecrate.

### Opening B: Three-Gate Opening (Advanced -- highly recommended by the podcast host)

**Turn 1 (Action Phase 1):**
1. Move a Cultist to an adjacent area (1 Power).
2. Move another Cultist to a second adjacent area (1 Power).
3. Give 3 Doom to another player to earn a Spellbook -- take Passion. Choose carefully who receives the Doom: never give it to doom-loving factions (Tcho-Tcho, Daemon Sultan, Ancients, Bubastis). Give it to a combat-focused faction that earns Doom more slowly.
4. Build Gates with your positioned Cultists. You should end Turn 1 with 3 Gates.
5. Total spent: 8 Power. You have 3 Gates and Passion.

**Turn 2 (Action Phase 2):**
1. You have approximately 12 Power (6 Cultists + 6 from Gates).
2. Move a Cultist out, awaken the King in Yellow (4 Power), earning that Spellbook.
3. Use remaining Power (approximately 7) to build a 4th Gate, move and capture for a 5th Gate. The King has zero combat but is still a Great Old One, so he blocks enemy Great Old Ones from capturing -- and most opponents are spending this turn awakening their own Great Old Ones, leaving you free to expand.

**Turn 3 (Action Phase 3):**
1. You have approximately 15 Power (massive income from 4-5 Gates).
2. Awaken Hastur (10 Power). Take Third Eye.
3. You still have 5 Power remaining to begin Screaming Dead + Desecrate or defend your position.

**Trade-offs:** The three-Gate opening sacrifices speed on Spellbooks (you may not Desecrate until Turn 4) in exchange for massive Power income and board disruption. You substitute raw Doom from Gates for Elder Signs from desecration. The risk: if a combat faction like Great Cthulhu gets unlimited combat before you have your Spellbooks online, you are in trouble. If that looks likely, abandon the Gate expansion plan and rush Hastur out instead.

## Early Game (Turns 1-3)

**Primary Goals:**
- Get the King in Yellow on the map as soon as possible (Turn 1 ideally)
- Awaken Hastur by Turn 2-3 and immediately take Third Eye
- Position for desecration in glyph areas (on Earth: Arabia for the claw glyph, East/West Africa for the chevron glyph)
- Earn Passion early for the Power refund engine
- Begin summoning Undead to build the King's entourage

**Key Principles:**
- Do not Desecrate before you have Third Eye. Desecrating at 2 Power with no Elder Sign reward is inefficient. Wait for the engine to come online.
- Cheap actions are your friend. Undead summons, Cultist recruits, and single moves all cost 1 Power. Use these to stagger your spending and outlast opponents.
- On Earth, Arabia is the best opening position because it has the claw glyph and is adjacent to Africa's chevron glyph areas, setting up your first two Desecrate Spellbooks with minimal travel.

## Mid Game (Turns 4-5)

**Transition Strategy:**
- Your engine should be fully online: Third Eye active, Screaming Dead available, the King roaming with 4-5 Undead.
- Execute the Screaming Dead + Desecrate loop to earn your remaining Desecrate Spellbooks. Aim to get 1-2 Desecrate Spellbooks per action phase. All three in one turn is possible but not guaranteed.
- The North Atlantic (on Earth) is a strong staging area between action phases -- it is adjacent to many glyph regions. However, it is also heavily contested, so do not linger there if enemies are nearby.
- Try to complete your Desecrate Spellbooks before opponents achieve unlimited combat. Once they have it, moving around the map with the King becomes much more dangerous because opponents can attack without moving in first.
- Keep both Great Old Ones together in one group whenever possible. Screaming Dead to move the King, then Move Hastur as the second action. The combined threat of Vengeance plus the Undead/Byakhee screen deters most attackers.
- Start performing Rituals of Annihilation once you have all 6 Spellbooks. Even with only 1-2 Gates, your two Great Old Ones make Rituals worthwhile (4-6 Doom per Ritual when counting Elder Signs).
- Use Feast income to partially offset Ritual costs.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

**Closing Out the Game:**
- Once all Spellbooks are earned, shift to maximum aggression on the Doom track. Ritual every turn you can afford to.
- Continue desecrating for Elder Signs when the opportunity costs are low (1 Power with Third Eye).
- A typical winning Yellow Sign finish involves 20+ Doom from Gates/Rituals plus 6-12 Elder Signs worth of bonus points.
- If you are sitting on a large pile of Elder Signs, reveal low-value ones (1s) face-up to reduce political heat. Keep high-value ones hidden.
- The Hastur hit squad becomes a game-closer: use He Who Is Not To Be Named + Shriek of the Byakhee to assassinate enemy Great Old Ones who threaten your position. Sniping Nyarlathotep or Cthulhu can remove the only threats capable of stopping your engine.
- If your Great Old Ones get killed late, do not despair. Execute the "skeleton crew" strategy: use your cheap Undead (1 Power each) and Zingaya to steal Gates, recruit Cultists cheaply, and scrape together enough Doom from 2-3 Gates to perform one final Ritual. Your Elder Sign pile may be enough to push you over the finish line even without your Great Old Ones.
- Do not give up even when things look bleak. Yellow Sign players are notorious for being salty when their Great Old Ones get killed, but the faction has more resilience than it appears.

## Power Combos & Synergies

**The Desecrate Engine (Core Combo):**
Screaming Dead (1 Power) -> move King + Undead into glyph area -> Desecrate (1 Power with Third Eye) -> place desecration token + earn Elder Sign + place a free unit. Total: 2 Power for massive value. Repeat across the map.

**Hastur Hit Squad:**
He Who Is Not To Be Named (1 Power) -> teleport Hastur to area with enemy Cultist/GOO -> Shriek of the Byakhee (1 Power, second action) -> bring all Byakhee into the area -> Battle (0 Power with unlimited combat). Total: 2 Power to assemble 9-12 combat dice plus Vengeance targeting. Devastates enemy Great Old Ones.

**Passion + Cultist Shield:**
Place Cultists alongside your Great Old Ones. When opponents attack, assign kills to Cultists, gain 1 Power from Passion, and your Great Old One survives. You can immediately recruit the Cultist back for 1 Power, resetting the shield. Opponents waste their attack; you lose nothing.

**Zingaya Gate Steal:**
Move an Undead into an area with a lone enemy Cultist on a Gate -> Zingaya (1 Power) to convert the Cultist into your Undead -> Recruit your own Cultist there (1 Power). Total: 3 Power (including the move) to steal a Gate. This is cheaper than building a new Gate (3 Power) and removes an enemy Gate simultaneously.

**Double Move Escape:**
Screaming Dead (1 Power) -> move King to adjacent area -> Move (1 Power, second action) -> move King again. The King effectively moves two areas for 2 Power, useful for escaping danger when the Undead ball is scattered.

**Feast + Desecration Token Stacking:**
Leave one Undead behind in each desecrated area to trigger Feast during Gather Power. Three feasted areas generate 3 extra Power per turn, which nearly pays for a Ritual of Annihilation on its own.

## Factions to Watch Out For

**Great Cthulhu:** Your single biggest threat. Cthulhu is cheap to awaken, rolls massive combat dice, and gets unlimited combat relatively early. Once Cthulhu has unlimited combat and Dreams, your Gates and your Great Old Ones are in constant danger. Dreams also lets Cthulhu steal Gates by converting your Cultists. Prioritize getting your Spellbooks done before Cthulhu comes fully online.

**Crawling Chaos:** Nyarlathotep is mobile and dangerous. Madness can redirect your pains to disastrous areas. If Crawling Chaos is in the game, the three-Gate opening becomes riskier because they start near you (on Earth) and can interfere early. Flight lets Nyarlathotep chase the King across the map.

**Bubastis (Cats):** Earth Cats can capture your Cultists repeatedly, and their mobility can be relentless. The upside: Zingaya works on Earth Cats, so you can convert them into Undead. The downside: do not give them your 3 free Doom -- they are a doom-loving faction that will use it to accelerate their already strong engine.

## Matchups

### vs Great Cthulhu
Your most dangerous opponent. Cthulhu gets cheap combat monsters and unlimited combat early. Dreams can steal your Gates. Avoid direct fights. Try to get your desecration Spellbooks completed before Cthulhu is fully online. The Hastur hit squad can snipe Cthulhu, but be prepared for the counterattack.

### vs Black Goat
Black Goat is less directly threatening since they are not a dominant combat faction. However, Shub-Niggurath can produce a swarm of cheap monsters that make areas difficult to move through. Watch out for Blood Sacrifice cycling Cultists for Power. Black Goat tends to stay in their corner, so you often can coexist peacefully.

### vs Crawling Chaos
A tricky matchup. Nyarlathotep is fast and dangerous, and Madness disrupts your pains (which you rely on for repositioning). On Earth, Crawling Chaos starts in your neighborhood. If they have Madness, be very cautious about getting into any battles, as your units may end up in the worst possible areas. Their Harbinger can also interfere with your desecration plans.

### vs Opener of the Way
Opener needs Gates on the map to earn their sixth Spellbook. Your three-Gate opening actively helps them. Yog-Sothoth hits extremely hard and can one-shot your Great Old Ones. However, Opener tends to be slow to develop and focused on their own Gate economy. Avoid areas where Yog-Sothoth is lurking and you can often coexist until the late game.

### vs Sleeper
Sleeper is generally not a direct threat to Yellow Sign. They spend the early game performing Spells and building up their engine. By the time Tsathoggua is active, you should have your own engine running. Be cautious of their late-game power spike and Cursed Slumber, which can neutralize your units in key areas.

### vs Windwalker
Ithaqua and the Wendigos are a serious combat threat. Windwalker's ability to hibernate and come back swinging makes them unpredictable. Their Howl ability can disrupt your positioning. The good news: they are usually focused on fighting everyone, not just you. Use the chaos they create to desecrate unopposed while others deal with the Windwalker threat.

### vs Tcho-Tcho
Do not give your 3 free Doom to Tcho-Tcho -- they are a doom-loving faction that will leverage it aggressively. Tcho-Tcho's Terror ability and their swarm of cheap Cultists can be annoying, but they are generally not equipped to hunt down and kill your Great Old Ones. Keep your distance and focus on your engine.

### vs Ancients
Another doom-loving faction that should never receive your 3 free Doom. The Ancients have strong board control and can contest areas you need for desecration. Their Great Old One, the Watcher of the Green Pyramid, can be a problem if it parks in a glyph area you need. Try to complete your desecrations in areas the Ancients are not contesting.

### vs Daemon Sultan
Daemon Sultan is a doom engine faction -- absolutely do not give them your 3 free Doom. Their late-game Doom generation can outpace even yours. The matchup often comes down to who builds the faster engine. Focus on your desecration tempo and try to close out before Azathoth hits critical mass.

### vs Bubastis
The Cats are fast, annoying, and can capture your Cultists repeatedly across the map. Earth Cats count as Cultists, which means Zingaya can convert them into Undead -- use this to punish them. Do not give them your 3 free Doom. Their mobility can interfere with your desecration plans, but they lack the raw combat power to kill your Great Old Ones outright.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Desecrating before Third Eye is online.** This is the number one mistake new Yellow Sign players make. Desecrating at 2 Power with no Elder Sign reward is expensive and inefficient. Wait until Hastur is on the map and you have Third Eye.

2. **Taking a Spellbook other than Third Eye when awakening Hastur.** Just take Third Eye. It will be awkward if you do not. Approximately 99% of the time, Third Eye is the correct pick.

3. **Always using the second action on Screaming Dead.** You do not have to Desecrate every time you use Screaming Dead. Sometimes moving for 1 Power and stopping is the correct play. Stagger your Power spending.

4. **Giving 3 free Doom to doom-loving factions.** Never give your free Doom to Tcho-Tcho, Daemon Sultan, Ancients, or Bubastis. When the game ends, the scoreboard will blame you.

5. **Ignoring Zingaya.** Many players go entire games without using this ability. Zingaya is an incredibly efficient way to steal Gates and is essential for the skeleton crew fallback strategy.

6. **Despairing when your Great Old Ones die.** Yellow Sign players are notorious for giving up once the King and Hastur are killed. You are not out of the game. Use the skeleton crew strategy: cheap Undead, Zingaya Gate steals, Passion Power refunds, and your existing Elder Sign pile can still carry you to victory.

7. **Neglecting Gate economy entirely.** Even though Elder Signs are your primary path to victory, raw Doom from Gates matters. Two Gates provides 10 Power per turn, which is workable. Three Gates with Feast income gives you comfortable room to Desecrate and Ritual.

8. **Leaving the King exposed without an entourage.** The King has zero combat. Never leave him alone without at least some Undead or a Cultist to absorb hits.

## Tips & Tricks

- **The three-Gate opening is fully endorsed** by the podcast host as his preferred way to play Yellow Sign. It catches opponents off guard because they expect the standard move-King-Desecrate pattern. You trade Elder Sign speed for massive Power income and board disruption. Blend both styles (Gate expansion early, desecration mid-game) to reach your full potential.

- **Stagger your Power spending.** This is a core advanced tactic across all factions but is especially important for Yellow Sign. Taking cheap 1-Power actions (summon Undead, recruit Cultist, move) lets you outlast opponents and take your big actions when they are out of Power and cannot respond.

- **Use Passion offensively.** Getting your Cultists killed is not always bad. When you are out of Power and someone attacks, absorbing the kill on a Cultist gives you 1 Power -- enough to move to safety, recruit back, or take another cheap action. Your Gates are harder to take than they look.

- **The Hastur hit squad is a legitimate strategy.** With He Who Is Not To Be Named + Shriek of the Byakhee + unlimited combat, you can assassinate enemy Great Old Ones for just 2-3 Power total. If you can snipe Nyarlathotep or another key threat, you may be free to run the desecration engine unopposed for the rest of the game.

- **Head fakes win games.** If your group is accustomed to Yellow Sign always doing the standard move-and-Desecrate pattern, going for a three-Gate opening will genuinely catch them off guard. The value of juking opponents is enormous in Cthulhu Wars.

- **The North Atlantic is a great staging area but a dangerous one.** On Earth, it connects to most glyph regions you need. But everyone else wants that area too, so do not park there if threats are nearby.

- **Strategically reveal Elder Signs.** If you have a pile of face-down Elder Signs, opponents will assume the worst and gang up on you. Revealing low-value tokens (1s) reduces political heat while keeping your high-value ones hidden.

- **Five Undead plus the King guarantees a successful Desecrate.** You cannot roll higher than 6 on a single die, so 6 total units in the area means automatic success. Build toward this threshold as quickly as possible.

- **Do not be afraid to Ritual on 1-2 Gates.** With two Great Old Ones, even a small Ritual yields 4-6 Doom (Gate Doom plus Elder Signs). Combined with your Elder Sign pile, this closes out games fast.

- **Yellow Sign wins through inevitability, not domination.** You do not need to control the most Gates or win the most battles. Every Desecration token is permanent doom that cannot be taken away. Focus on reaching your Desecrate targets each turn rather than fighting over territory you do not need. *(community insight)*

- **Hastur's combat ability is best used surgically, not constantly.** The King in Yellow is expensive to lose and time-consuming to resummon. Use him to eliminate one critical threat -- an enemy GOO blocking your Desecrate path or a faction about to win -- then retreat to safety. Hastur is a scalpel, not a hammer. *(community insight)*

- **Undead are disposable by design.** Do not try to keep all your Undead alive. They exist to fuel Desecrate checks and absorb hits in combat. Losing two Undead in a battle you chose to fight is often better than spending 2 Power to avoid the fight entirely. *(Sandy Petersen)*

## Frequently Asked Questions

*Common rules questions specific to Yellow Sign. Sourced from the [official Petersen Games FAQ](https://petersengames.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48000952254) and community rulings.*

### Does Desecration cost an action?

Yes. Desecrate is an action that costs 2 Power normally, or 1 Power with Third Eye active. It counts as your action for the turn. However, when used as the second action granted by Screaming Dead, it effectively piggybacks onto the Screaming Dead action, letting you move and Desecrate in the same turn for a combined 2-3 Power.

### Can Screaming Dead trigger multiple times per turn?

No. Screaming Dead is a single 1-cost action that moves the King in Yellow plus accompanying Undead to an adjacent area, then grants you one additional different action. You cannot chain Screaming Dead into another Screaming Dead. The second action must be something other than Screaming Dead (and cannot be He Who Is Not To Be Named either).

### How does the Undead combat mechanic interact with Devour?

If Great Cthulhu uses Devour against a group of Undead, the enemy (Yellow Sign) chooses which unit to eliminate. If they lose an Undead, the remaining Undead in the battle roll fewer dice because their combat value equals the number of Undead present minus one. Losing even one Undead before dice are rolled significantly weakens the group. This makes Devour particularly devastating against Undead formations.

### Does Hastur's combat ability work on defense, or only when attacking?

Hastur's combat dice (equal to the current Ritual of Annihilation cost) apply in all battles, whether attacking or defending. His Vengeance ability (choosing which enemy units receive combat results) also applies regardless of who initiated the battle. This makes Hastur a potent deterrent even when sitting on a gate -- opponents know that attacking into Hastur means he chooses where the kills and pains land.

### Can you use Third Eye if you have no Undead in your pool?

Third Eye does not require Undead in your pool. Third Eye is a passive ongoing ability that reduces Desecrate's cost from 2 to 1 Power and grants an Elder Sign on a successful desecration. It only requires Hastur to be in play. The Desecrate action itself requires you to roll a die against your total unit count in the area, and on success you place a monster or Cultist costing 2 or less -- but if you have no valid units in your pool, you simply skip the unit placement.

### Does He Who Is Not To Be Named work across maps in multi-map games?

Yes. He Who Is Not To Be Named teleports Hastur to any area containing a Cultist of any faction, regardless of distance. In multi-map games, this means Hastur can jump between maps as long as a Cultist exists at the destination. This makes the ability even more powerful in larger games where the maps are more spread out.

### Does Passion trigger if my Cultist is eliminated by my own ability (like Blood Sacrifice)?

No. Passion only triggers when your Cultists are eliminated by an enemy. Self-inflicted eliminations such as Blood Sacrifice, your own spellbook requirements (eliminate 2 Cultists), or Desecrate's unit-placement replacing your own Cultist do not trigger Passion. The elimination must come from another player's action or ability.

### Can Zingaya convert a Cultist that is on a gate?

Yes. Zingaya targets an enemy Cultist in an area where you have Undead, and it converts that Cultist into an Undead under your control. If the converted Cultist was the only enemy unit controlling a gate, that gate becomes uncontrolled. You can then recruit one of your own Cultists there to take control. This is one of Yellow Sign's most efficient gate-stealing plays at just 1 Power for the conversion plus 1 Power for the recruit.

### If the King in Yellow is killed, can I still use Screaming Dead when I re-awaken him?

Yes. Screaming Dead is a spellbook you have already earned, and it remains active permanently. When you re-awaken the King in Yellow (for 4 Power), you can immediately begin using Screaming Dead again on your next action. The key cost is the tempo loss from spending 4 Power and an action to re-awaken him rather than advancing your desecration engine.
