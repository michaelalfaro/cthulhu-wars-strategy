# Black Goat

## Overview

Black Goat is one of the most rewarding and challenging factions in Cthulhu Wars. It is a puzzle faction -- the kind of faction where the optimal line of play is not always obvious, and getting it right feels deeply satisfying. When piloted well, Black Goat is among the strongest factions in the game, but it demands careful timing, disciplined expansion, and a clear understanding of when to spread out and when to consolidate. The host of the Opening the Way podcast considers it his favorite faction, describing it as "awesome" and "the most puzzly" of any Cthulhu Wars faction.

**Difficulty:** Hard (comparable to Opener of the Way)
**Playstyle:** Expansive, flexible, swarm-based economy
**Home Area:** West Africa
**Unique Faction Ability:** Fertility Cult -- You may summon monsters as an unlimited action.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

Black Goat is fundamentally about building a sprawling economy of bodies and Gates. Your Spellbook requirements push you to expand into many areas (four, six, and eight), and your toolkit gives you creative ways to get there without overcommitting. Once you have your Spellbooks, you contract your forces into a defensible stronghold where Shub-Niggurath and a crowd of Cultists and monsters become nearly impregnable.

**Core Philosophy:** Expand, earn Spellbooks, contract, and doom-rush. Black Goat plays a tempo game -- you are racing to get Blood Sacrifice online as early as possible so that every Doom phase earns you a free Elder Sign. Over the course of a full game, this passive income can account for nearly 20% of your total Doom.

**Strengths:**
- Fertility Cult lets you summon monsters as an unlimited action, giving you unmatched reactive flexibility on both offense and defense
- Blood Sacrifice generates free Elder Signs every Doom phase, providing a massive long-term Doom advantage
- Red Sign turns Dark Young into pseudo-Cultists that generate Power, build Gates, and cannot be captured -- potentially giving you up to nine Power-generating units
- Necrophagy lets your Ghouls intervene in any battle anywhere on the map, clearing areas for you to steal Gates
- Avatar is one of the strongest movement abilities in the game, letting Shub teleport across the board to steal remote Gates
- Thousand Young dramatically reduces summoning costs, making your economy extremely efficient
- Late-game turtling with Shub, Frenzy Cultists, and multiple Dark Young creates a nearly unassailable defense

**Weaknesses:**
- One of the hardest factions to pilot correctly -- poor timing on expansion will sabotage you
- Spellbook requirements demand spreading into many areas, exposing your Cultists to capture
- Shub costs a steep 8 Power to awaken and is critical to your entire strategy -- losing her is devastating
- Many of your strongest abilities (Blood Sacrifice, Thousand Young, Avatar) require Shub to be in play
- Lower starting combat power compared to aggressive factions like Great Cthulhu or Windwalker
- Groth can backfire or whiff on high rolls, and is actively harmful against certain factions (Daemon Sultan)

## Spellbook Abilities

### Blood Sacrifice
**Unlock condition:** Awaken Shub-Niggurath (or any available requirement)
**Effect:** If Shub is in play during the Doom phase, you may eliminate one of your Cultists from anywhere on the map to gain one Elder Sign.
**Strategic notes:** This is arguably Black Goat's most important Spellbook. Getting it online as early as possible -- ideally Action Phase 1 -- is one of the strongest things you can do. Each Elder Sign averages about 1.67 Doom, so earning three or four over the course of a game translates to roughly five or six extra Doom essentially for free. That is close to 20% of the 30 Doom you need to win. Blood Sacrifice also naturally cycles Cultists back into your pool, which is valuable for recruiting into newly conquered areas. Prioritize this Spellbook first.

### Frenzy
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement
**Effect:** Ongoing. Your Cultists have a combat value of 1.
**Strategic notes:** Frenzy transforms your Cultists from helpless fodder into legitimate combat contributors. A turtled-up area with Shub and five Cultists is rolling 10+ dice (five from Shub's combat calculation, five from Frenzy). This makes your late-game fortress extremely dangerous to attack. Frenzy also enables an aggressive early opening where you move Cultists into lightly defended Gates and declare battles, using them as expendable attackers. Combined with Necrophagy, a single Cultist can start a fight that your Ghouls finish.

### Necrophagy
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement
**Effect:** Post-battle ability. You may move any or all Ghouls not involved in a battle from any area into the battle area. For each Ghoul moved, both sides suffer an additional Pain result.
**Strategic notes:** One of Black Goat's best Spellbooks and your primary tool for expanding into new areas. Necrophagy lets your Ghouls intervene in any battle anywhere on the map -- even battles you are not involved in. With two Ghouls, you apply up to two extra Pains to both sides, often clearing the area entirely. Then you simply recruit a Cultist next turn and claim the Gate. This ability is phenomenal for reaching your six- and eight-area Spellbook requirements without risking your own Cultists. It also makes every battle on the board your business, which is deeply annoying for your opponents.

### Red Sign
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement
**Effect:** Ongoing. Dark Young can create and control Gates. They add +1 to Shub's combat and provide 1 Power during Gather Power (like a Cultist). They do not count as Cultists for any other purpose and cannot be captured (except by Capture Monster).
**Strategic notes:** Red Sign effectively gives you nine units that generate Power and can hold Gates (six Cultists plus three Dark Young). This is a massive economic advantage. Dark Young on Gates are "stickier" than Cultists because they cannot be captured -- opponents must declare a battle to dislodge them. When expanding, sending a Dark Young into a new area is safer than sending a Cultist, since it cannot be captured and can build its own Gate. Red Sign also means a fully deployed Black Goat can theoretically exceed the normal six-Gate cap, reaching seven to nine Gates in dominant board states.

### Thousand Young
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement
**Effect:** Ongoing. If Shub is in play, Ghouls, Fungi from Yuggoth, and Dark Young each cost 1 less Power to summon.
**Strategic notes:** This Spellbook supercharges your economy. Ghouls drop to 0 Power (free stalling actions via Fertility Cult), Fungi drop to 1 Power (excellent rate for 1 combat), and Dark Young drop to 2 Power (much more affordable). Getting Thousand Young before summoning your expensive units -- especially Dark Young -- saves significant Power over the course of the game. Free Ghoul summons are particularly valuable for staggering your Power spending, letting you take two zero-cost actions while opponents burn through their resources.

### Groth
**Unlock condition:** Any available Spellbook requirement
**Effect:** Action (costs 2 Power). Roll the Groth die (a d6). If the result is equal to or less than the number of areas containing your Fungi, your enemies must eliminate Cultists equal to the roll, divided among themselves (they have one minute to decide; if they cannot agree, you choose). If the result is higher, you must place a Cultist from any faction's pool into any area on the map.
**Strategic notes:** Groth is a high-variance disruption tool that is best used when you have all four Fungi spread across four different areas, giving you a 4-in-6 chance of success. On a successful roll of 4, you can devastate a faction that is spread thin across many Gates, potentially costing them control of multiple Gates. Groth is strongest when you have excess Power to use it multiple times. However, be aware of critical matchup considerations: never use Groth against Daemon Sultan (their Psychosis ability makes losing Cultists a benefit), and be cautious against Yellow Sign (Passion triggers on elimination, giving them Power back, though a high roll still hurts them). Groth is devastating against Sleeper, who relies on hoarding Power via Lethargy and cannot afford to re-recruit four Cultists.

## Units

### Cultists (Acolytes)
**Cost:** 1 Power (recruit)
**Combat:** 0 (1 with Frenzy)
**Count:** 6
**Tactical role:** Black Goat Cultists are not your typical Cultists. With Frenzy, they become combat-capable (1 die each), and with Blood Sacrifice, they are a renewable resource that generates Elder Signs every Doom phase. You will deliberately cycle Cultists between the board and your pool throughout the game. Stacking multiple Cultists on a Gate makes it expensive for opponents to capture (each capture costs 1 Power), and their contribution to Shub's combat stat means a crowd of Cultists around Shub is a serious defensive wall.

### Ghouls
**Cost:** 1 Power (0 with Thousand Young)
**Combat:** 0
**Count:** 2
**Tactical role:** Ghouls are Black Goat's secret weapon despite having zero combat. Their entire value comes from Necrophagy, which lets them teleport into any battle on the map and apply Pain results. Think of them as mobile area-denial units. Position them in central locations so they can reach any fight. After Necrophagy clears an area, your Ghouls are already there -- recruit a Cultist next turn and you own the Gate. With Thousand Young, they cost nothing, making them perfect for stalling actions via Fertility Cult.

### Fungi from Yuggoth
**Cost:** 2 Power (1 with Thousand Young)
**Combat:** 1
**Count:** 4
**Tactical role:** Fungi are solid, efficient monsters. At 1 Power with Thousand Young, they offer the best combat-per-cost ratio in your roster. Their primary strategic value comes from spreading them across four different areas to power up Groth. Each Fungus in a unique area increases your Groth success threshold. Even without Groth, they serve as reliable Gate defenders that block capture by enemy monsters.

### Dark Young
**Cost:** 3 Power (2 with Thousand Young)
**Combat:** 2
**Count:** 3
**Tactical role:** Dark Young are Black Goat's premier monsters. With Red Sign, they become incredibly versatile: they generate Power, build and control Gates, and add +1 each to Shub's combat. They cannot be captured (only by Capture Monster abilities), making them the safest unit to send into new areas when expanding. A Dark Young on a Gate with a couple of Frenzy-empowered Cultists creates a defensive position that is simply not worth attacking for most opponents. Dark Young are your expansion vanguard and your economic backbone.

### Shub-Niggurath (Great Old One)
**Cost:** 8 Power to awaken; requires a controlled Gate and at least 2 Cultists on the map (those 2 Cultists are eliminated upon awakening)
**Combat:** Equal to your total Cultists on the map + your controlled Gates (+1 per Dark Young in play with Red Sign)
**Count:** 1
**Tactical role:** Shub is the linchpin of your entire faction. She enables Blood Sacrifice (free Elder Signs), Thousand Young (reduced summoning costs), and Avatar (teleportation). Her variable combat stat means she can roll a huge number of dice when you have lots of plastic on the board. Protect Shub at all costs -- losing her shuts down three of your best Spellbooks and costs you 8 Power to re-awaken. In the late game, park Shub in a fortress area with multiple Cultists, Dark Young, and Fungi for a nearly unassailable position.

**Avatar (Shub's Ability):** Action (1 Power). Choose an area and a faction in that area. Swap Shub's location with a monster or Cultist in that area (the faction's owner chooses which unit is swapped). This is one of the strongest movement abilities in the game. Avatar ignores distance entirely -- you can reach any area on the map for just 1 Power. Use it aggressively in the early game to steal remote, poorly defended Gates. You can also Avatar with your own units to reposition Shub to safety or place a Cultist on a distant Gate. Key detail: Avatar can only swap monsters or Cultists, never Great Old Ones. If an opponent has only a Great Old One and one Cultist on a Gate, they must swap the Cultist, leaving their GOO stranded.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

Black Goat has several viable openings. The podcast highlights the "Shub Rush" as one of the strongest.

### Action Phase 1: The Shub Rush (Recommended)
You start with exactly 8 Power -- just enough to awaken Shub.

1. **Awaken Shub-Niggurath** (8 Power) -- eliminate 2 Cultists, place Shub at your Gate. Take **Blood Sacrifice** as your Spellbook.
2. You are now out of Power with 4 Cultists remaining and Shub on your Gate. This looks scary, but you are already earning Elder Signs.

**Why this works:** In the Doom phase, every other player likely built a second Gate and earns 2 Doom. You only have 1 Gate (1 Doom), but Blood Sacrifice gives you an Elder Sign worth 1-3 Doom. Even on a roll of 1, you match the other players. On a 2 or 3, you are actually ahead -- and you have not spent any Power on Gate construction.

### Action Phase 2: Expansion
You now have 6 Power (4 Cultists + 1 Gate + Shub does not generate Power) and only 3 Cultists after Blood Sacrifice.

1. **Eliminate 2 Cultists** (Spellbook requirement) -- take **Thousand Young**. You now have 1 Cultist and Shub on your Gate.
2. **Summon 2 Ghouls for free** (0 Power each with Thousand Young) -- two stalling actions while opponents spend Power awakening their GOOs.
3. **Avatar** (1 Power) to a vulnerable Gate once opponents are low on Power. Opponents pick which unit gets swapped to your area, so make sure you have a monster defending your home Gate.
4. **Recruit** (1 Power) a Cultist at the newly claimed Gate.
5. Consider Avataring again or moving to reach 4 areas. Take the **4 areas Spellbook** when eligible.
6. If you can share areas with all enemies simultaneously, take that Spellbook too (gaining Power back equal to the number of enemy players).

### Action Phase 3: Consolidation
By now you should have 3-4 Spellbooks. Focus on:
1. Reaching 6 and 8 areas (use Ghouls via Necrophagy and Dark Young for safe expansion)
2. Awakening Shub is already done -- you are ahead of the curve
3. Begin contracting your forces back to defensible positions once area Spellbooks are claimed
4. Take remaining Spellbooks (Frenzy, Necrophagy, Red Sign, Groth -- whichever you still need)

### Alternative Opening: The Frenzy Rush
Pioneered by player KP from the Cthulhu Wars Discord community.

1. **Action Phase 1:** Move a Cultist, build a Gate, move two more Cultists into different areas to reach 4 areas. Take **Frenzy**. Summon 2 Ghouls (1 Power each).
2. **Action Phase 2:** Eliminate 2 Cultists for Spellbook requirement, take **Necrophagy**. While opponents awaken their GOOs, move your Frenzy Cultists into their lightly defended Gates and declare battles. Even if your Cultist dies, Necrophagy brings in both Ghouls to Pain everyone out. Recruit into the empty Gate.
3. This opening trades early Shub awakening for rapid area expansion and Gate theft.
4. **Warning:** Practice this opening before using it in a competitive game. If opponents capture your exposed Cultists, you lose areas and set yourself back significantly.

### Alternative Opening: The Dark Young Fortress
1. **Action Phase 1:** Stay on one Gate, summon 2 Dark Young (6 Power), eliminate 2 Cultists for Spellbook requirement, take **Red Sign**.
2. Dark Young immediately start generating Power next Gather Power phase, so you are still at 8 Power for Action Phase 2.
3. In subsequent phases, move Dark Young into new areas and build Gates with them (they can do this with Red Sign).
4. This is a safer, more deliberate expansion that does not rely on Shub being out early.

## Early Game (Turns 1-3)

**Primary Goals:**
- Get Blood Sacrifice online as soon as possible (ideally Action Phase 1)
- Reach 4 areas by end of Action Phase 2
- Avoid getting your Cultists captured while expanding
- Stagger your Power spending to outlast opponents -- take cheap actions while they build Gates and awaken GOOs

**Key Principles:**
- Do not rush your area expansion. The 4-area Spellbook happens naturally from just playing the game. The 6- and 8-area books can wait until Action Phase 3 or even 4.
- Avatar is your best tool for reaching distant areas cheaply. Wait until opponents are low on Power, then Avatar to their vulnerable Gates.
- Use Fertility Cult defensively -- if someone threatens your Gate, you can instantly summon monsters and still have your action available.
- Blood Sacrifice every single Doom phase. Never skip it unless Shub is dead.

## Mid Game (Turns 4-5)

**Transition Strategy:**
- By now you should have most or all of your Spellbooks. If you do not have 6 Spellbooks yet, make that your top priority before ritualing.
- Begin contracting your forces. Pull stray Cultists back to safety using the eliminate-2-Cultists Spellbook requirement (if you have not used it yet) or by simply moving them.
- Set up your fortress area: Shub + multiple Cultists + Dark Young + Fungi. With Frenzy, this position rolls an enormous number of dice.
- Deploy Fungi to four different areas if you want to use Groth offensively. Groth is best when you have excess Power and can fire it multiple times to suppress opponents.
- Start ritualing once you have all 6 Spellbooks and a strong Gate position (3+ Gates).

**Power Economy:**
- With Red Sign, your Dark Young generate Power like Cultists. Six Cultists + three Dark Young = 9 Power before Gates. This gives you a huge resource advantage.
- Continue using Blood Sacrifice every Doom phase. The Elder Signs compound over the game.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

**Closing Out the Game:**
- Black Goat wins by accumulating Doom steadily through Gates, Rituals, and Blood Sacrifice Elder Signs. You are not trying to spike a single massive Doom turn -- you are grinding consistent value every phase.
- Protect Shub above all else. Once opponents have unlimited combat, stop Avataring aggressively. Park Shub in your fortress.
- Ritual every Doom phase once you have all Spellbooks. Three Gates + one GOO + Elder Sign from Blood Sacrifice = significant Doom each phase.
- Use Groth to suppress opponents who are trying to catch up. Making them lose Cultists forces them to spend Power re-recruiting instead of advancing their own Doom.
- If you got Blood Sacrifice early and used it every Doom phase, you should be 4-6 Doom ahead of the pace, making it very hard for opponents to catch you.

**Endgame Defense:**
- Your fortress should be nearly impregnable: Shub (rolling 8-12 dice with all Cultists and Gates counted), plus Frenzy Cultists (1 die each), plus Dark Young (2 dice each). Opponents need overwhelming force to crack this.
- Necrophagy continues to punish anyone fighting near your Ghouls, potentially handing you free Gates even in the final phases.

## Power Combos & Synergies

**Blood Sacrifice + Early Shub Awakening:** The earlier you get Blood Sacrifice, the more Elder Signs you earn over the game. Awakening Shub on Action Phase 1 and immediately taking Blood Sacrifice is the single highest-value play Black Goat can make.

**Thousand Young + Fertility Cult:** Free Ghoul summons (0 Power) via Fertility Cult give you unlimited stalling actions. Summon a Ghoul, pass priority, let opponents burn Power. Do this twice per Action Phase to maintain your Power advantage.

**Necrophagy + Frenzy:** Move a Frenzy Cultist into a lightly defended area, declare battle (your Cultist has 1 combat die), then bring in both Ghouls via Necrophagy. Even if your Cultist dies, the two extra Pains clear the area. Recruit next turn and take the Gate.

**Avatar + Recruit:** Avatar Shub to a remote Gate (1 Power), then recruit a Cultist there (1 Power). For just 2 Power, you have established a presence anywhere on the map. You can then Avatar Shub back to safety by swapping with one of your own units.

**Red Sign + Frenzy Defense:** A Gate with one Dark Young and two Frenzy Cultists rolls 4-5 dice on defense. The Dark Young cannot be captured, so opponents must fight their way in. This makes your Gates extremely expensive to take.

**Groth + Power Advantage:** When you have 6-8 Power more than opponents, fire Groth repeatedly (2 Power each). Successful rolls force opponents to lose Cultists and spend Power re-recruiting, while you maintain your advantage. Three or four successful Groths in one Action Phase can cripple the table.

## Factions to Watch Out For

**Opener of the Way:** The single most dangerous faction for Black Goat. Dread Curse of Azathoth can snipe Shub from anywhere on the map by rolling dice without needing to be in the same area. Be extremely careful about Avataring when Opener is in the game -- Shub appearing alone on a remote Gate is a prime Dread Curse target.

**Crawling Chaos:** Flight lets Nyarlathotep reach your Gates quickly, and Madness can redirect your Pain results in battle. If Crawling Chaos is in the game, be cautious about the three-Gate opening and about leaving Cultists exposed near their units.

**Any faction with easy capture:** Capturing your Cultists as you expand toward 6 and 8 areas is the simplest way to thwart Black Goat. Watch for opponents who have monsters positioned near your expansion routes.

## Matchups

### vs Great Cthulhu
Cthulhu's Dreams ability can steal your Gates if you only have one Cultist defending. Stack multiple Cultists on Gates to play around Dreams. Cthulhu's combat power is formidable, but your Necrophagy can intervene in fights involving Cthulhu's forces, potentially stealing Gates they just fought over. Avoid direct combat with a fully loaded Cthulhu -- turtle up and let Blood Sacrifice outpace him on Doom.

### vs Crawling Chaos
Flight makes Nyarlathotep extremely mobile and dangerous to your spread-out Cultists. Do not leave lone Cultists in areas adjacent to Crawling Chaos. Madness can disrupt your battle plans by redirecting Pains, so be cautious about relying on Necrophagy in fights near their forces. If they lack Madness, Pains become free movement for you, which is actually helpful.

### vs Yellow Sign
Be cautious with Groth -- Passion triggers when Yellow Sign loses Cultists, giving them 1 Power and a free recruit later. A low Groth roll (1-2 Cultists eliminated) actively helps them. However, a high roll (forcing them to lose 4 Cultists) still nets positive since Passion only triggers once per instance. Desecration can threaten your Gates, so maintain strong defenses. Your Blood Sacrifice Doom engine can outpace their Doom generation if you play patiently.

### vs Opener of the Way
Your most dangerous matchup. Dread Curse of Azathoth can kill Shub from anywhere on the map, and losing Shub shuts down Blood Sacrifice, Thousand Young, and Avatar. Never leave Shub exposed without extra bodies to absorb Kills. Minimize Avataring when Opener has Power. On the positive side, your Necrophagy can interfere with their battles, and your swarm economy is resilient against their high-Power-cost playstyle.

### vs Sleeper
Groth is devastating against Sleeper. They rely on Lethargy to hoard Power while everyone else runs out, then strike. Forcing them to lose 4 Cultists via Groth costs them 4 Power on re-recruiting, directly undermining their Lethargy strategy. Sleeper tends to be passive early, which gives you time to expand peacefully. Just be aware of their late-game Tsathoggua, which can be very combat-heavy.

### vs Windwalker
Windwalker's mobility and combat power are scary, but they often spread thin across many Gates. Groth is excellent here -- forcing a Windwalker on four Gates to lose four Cultists can cost them control of multiple Gates. Necrophagy can interfere with Windwalker's battles and steal Gates they fought over. Avoid direct confrontation with Ithaqua and his deathball. Let them fight others while you expand and Doom-rush.

### vs Tcho-Tcho
Tcho-Tcho's ability to capture Cultists efficiently is a real concern during your expansion phase. Be very cautious about sending lone Cultists near Tcho-Tcho territories. Use Dark Young (with Red Sign) or Ghouls for expansion instead of Cultists when Tcho-Tcho is nearby. Their high priest mechanics can also accelerate their tempo, so do not let them run away with the game unchecked.

### vs Ancients
Ancients tend to play a defensive, area-control style. Your Necrophagy and Avatar give you tools to maneuver around their positions. Ancients may not aggressively target you, which gives you breathing room to expand. Just be mindful of any abilities they have that punish you for entering their territory, and avoid overextending into areas they have heavily fortified.

### vs Daemon Sultan
Never use Groth while Daemon Sultan is in the game. Their Psychosis ability lets them place Cultists for 0 Power in areas with no units, meaning losing Cultists to Groth is actually a benefit for them -- free stalling actions and free repositioning. This is a critical matchup rule to remember. Focus on other Spellbooks for disruption and rely on your Blood Sacrifice Doom engine to outpace them.

### vs Bubastis
Bubastis has strong reactive abilities and can be unpredictable. Treat them like any faction with good mobility -- protect your Cultists during expansion, maintain strong Gate defenses, and do not let them catch Shub exposed. Your swarm economy and Blood Sacrifice should give you a consistent Doom advantage if you play patiently and avoid unnecessary risks.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Spreading out too fast.** This is the number one mistake new Black Goat players make. You do not need to reach 8 areas immediately. Take one area-expansion Spellbook per Action Phase. Rushing the spread exposes your Cultists to capture and can lock you out of your Spellbooks entirely.

2. **Leaving Cultists exposed to capture.** A good opponent will capture any Cultist you leave undefended. Every captured Cultist is an area lost on your way to 6 and 8 areas. Use Dark Young (with Red Sign) or Ghouls for expansion instead of lone Cultists whenever possible.

3. **Skipping Blood Sacrifice.** Never skip a Blood Sacrifice opportunity. Every Elder Sign you miss is 1-3 Doom you will never get back. The cumulative value over a full game is enormous.

4. **Using Groth against Daemon Sultan.** Daemon Sultan benefits from losing Cultists via Psychosis. Using Groth against them is actively helping them.

5. **Avataring recklessly once opponents have unlimited combat.** Early-game Avatar is phenomenal for stealing Gates. Late-game Avatar with Shub can get her killed. Once unlimited combat is available, keep Shub in your fortress.

6. **Not protecting Shub.** Shub enables Blood Sacrifice, Thousand Young, and Avatar. Losing her once is recoverable. Losing her twice probably costs you the game. Always have extra bodies around Shub to absorb Kills in combat.

7. **Summoning expensive monsters before getting Thousand Young.** If you can get Thousand Young first, every Ghoul, Fungus, and Dark Young you summon afterward is 1 Power cheaper. The savings compound over the game.

8. **Using Groth with fewer than 4 Fungi in play.** Groth has a 4-in-6 success chance at maximum strength (4 Fungi in 4 areas). With fewer Fungi, the odds drop significantly, and the failure penalty (placing an opponent's Cultist) can actively hurt you.

9. **Ritualing before you have all 6 Spellbooks.** As a general rule across all factions, ending the game without all your Spellbooks is a disaster. Get your books first, then start ritualing.

## Tips & Tricks from the Podcast

- **Stagger your Power spending.** This is critical general advice that applies especially to Black Goat. Take cheap actions (free Ghoul summons, 1-Power recruits) while opponents burn through Power on expensive actions. When they run out, you strike with Avatar and steal their Gates.

- **Avatar with yourself.** You can swap Shub with your own units. If Shub Avatared to a remote Gate and you need to get her home, simply Avatar targeting your own faction in your home area. Shub goes back to safety, and your Cultist ends up on the remote Gate -- all for 1 Power instead of multiple movement actions.

- **Time your area-expansion Spellbooks with Share Areas.** If you can reach 6 or 8 areas and simultaneously share areas with all enemies, you earn multiple Spellbooks at once and get Power back from the Share Areas requirement. This recouped Power lets you immediately defend your new positions or contract your forces.

- **Use the eliminate-2-Cultists Spellbook requirement strategically.** Save this requirement for after you have reached 8 areas. Sacrifice two stray Cultists that are in dangerous positions, getting them back to the safety of your pool while earning a Spellbook. Two birds, one stone.

- **Fertility Cult is your emergency button.** If someone moves a Great Old One into your area, spend 6-7 Power summoning monsters as unlimited actions, then declare battle with your normal action. You can go from a seemingly defenseless position to rolling a fistful of dice in one turn.

- **In the early game, look for Gates where opponents have only a GOO and one Cultist.** Avatar forces them to swap the Cultist (since Avatar specifies "monster or Cultist"), stranding their GOO alone on the Gate. If they are out of Power, they cannot respond.

- **Blood Sacrifice Cultists cycle naturally.** Every Doom phase you sacrifice a Cultist, putting it back in your pool. Next Action Phase, you recruit it wherever you need it. This natural cycle means you always have a Cultist available for opportunistic recruits into newly conquered territory.

- **Necrophagy works in battles you are not involved in.** Two other factions fighting over a Gate? Bring in your Ghouls, Pain everyone out, recruit next turn. You just stole a Gate without spending any Power on movement or combat.

- **In larger player-count games (5-6 players), the Share Areas requirement becomes very rewarding.** Getting 4-5 Power back from sharing areas with all enemies is a huge windfall that can fund an entire turn of actions.
