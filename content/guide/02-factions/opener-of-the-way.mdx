# Opener of the Way

## Overview

Opener of the Way is the faction of Yog-Sothoth, the great old one who is coterminous with all of space and time. That cosmic identity translates directly into gameplay: this is a faction that rewards infinite knowledge of the board state, creative improvisation, and the ability to seize exactly the right opportunity at exactly the right moment. Opener is not the best at any single thing, but it can do a startling number of different things, and a skilled pilot can make it feel absolutely broken.

This is not a beginner faction. Opener delivers the highest highs and the lowest lows of any faction in the game. You will crash and burn with it more than once on your journey to mastery, and that is part of the learning process. The signature mechanic, Million Favored Ones, lets your units mutate and grow after battle, and learning to use that engine efficiently is the key to unlocking this faction's full potential. Paired with Dragon Descending's ability to double a ritual and Dragon Ascending's one-shot Power steal, Opener can close out games in a single doom phase in a way that catches the entire table off guard.

On the fight-versus-doom spectrum, Opener sits right in the middle. Million Favored Ones pulls you toward combat, but Dragon Descending gives you explosive doom-scoring potential. The best Opener players blend both sides, fighting when it is efficient and setting up a devastating ritual turn when the moment is right.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

Opener of the Way is a jack-of-all-trades faction that thrives on adaptability. Where other factions have a clear primary game plan, Opener asks you to read the table, identify which plan fits the current moment, and execute accordingly.

**Core identity traits:**

- **Improvisation over planning.** Rigid plans will fail. The game state is constantly changing, and Opener's toolkit is designed to exploit whatever opportunity presents itself. Flexibility is your greatest asset.
- **Efficient Power spending.** Opener has access to a remarkable number of 1-cost actions: battling for Million Favored Ones upgrades, Beyond One gate theft, and re-recruiting acolytes that mutated into monsters. Spending your Power as slowly as possible while extracting maximum value from each action is the hallmark of strong Opener play.
- **Gate awareness.** Two of your six spellbook requirements depend on total Gates on the map (8 Gates and 12 Gates). This means you are always tracking the global Gate count, always thinking about whether you or someone else should be building, and always mindful that Beyond One gate-stealing can actually work against you if it reduces the total Gate count below your thresholds.
- **Explosive finishes.** Dragon Descending doubles a single Ritual of Annihilation. Combined with Yog-Sothoth counting as a Gate, a well-timed ritual can catapult you from 15 doom to 30+ doom in a single doom phase, ending the game before anyone can react.

**Variable setup:** After all other players have placed, you start with 8 Power, 6 acolytes, and a controlled Gate in any empty area of your choice. This is the most flexible setup in the game. Consider the faction mix at the table, think about whether you want an aggressive or passive opening, and position yourself accordingly.

## Spellbook Abilities

### Channel Power
**Unlock condition:** Choose any available spellbook requirement when earned.
**Effect:** Battle ability (during battle). After you roll battle dice, you may pay 1 Power to re-roll all dice that were not kills or pains. You may do this more than once.
**Strategic notes:** This looks better on paper than it plays in practice. Opener does not typically roll large numbers of combat dice outside of Yog-Sothoth itself, so you often end up re-rolling only 2-3 blanks, which is not worth the Power. The math only starts favoring you at 5 or more blank dice. Use this sparingly and ideally only in battles where Yog-Sothoth is present with an entourage generating a large dice pool. Do not get addicted to paying Power for marginal re-rolls.

### Million Favored Ones
**Unlock condition:** Choose any available spellbook requirement when earned. (Typically taken first, off the "units at 2 enemy Gates" requirement.)
**Effect:** Post-battle. After pains and kills are resolved, promote any or all surviving acolytes to Mutants, Mutants to Abominations, and Abominations to Spawns of Yog-Sothoth. You may also promote a Spawn by transforming it into as many Mutants as are currently in your pool.
**Strategic notes:** This is arguably the best spellbook in all of Cthulhu Wars and the centerpiece of the entire faction. The key to using it well is having multiple units in the battle area so that each promotion cascades into real Power savings. A single Mutant upgrading to an Abomination after a 1-Power battle saves you nothing (2 + 1 = 3, the same as summoning the Abomination directly). But if you battle with 3 acolytes, a Mutant, and an Abomination, and they all survive, you end up with 3 Mutants, an Abomination, and a Spawn for a total of 6 Power spent versus the 13 Power it would cost to summon all those units from scratch. Your acolytes go safely back to the pool where nobody can capture them, and re-recruiting them is a cheap 1-cost action that also repositions them wherever you need them. Always be scanning the board for Million Favored Ones opportunities, but do not force battles just to promote a single unit.

### Dread Curse of Azathoth
**Unlock condition:** Choose any available spellbook requirement when earned.
**Effect:** 2-cost action. Select any area on the map. Roll 1 battle die per Abomination and Spawn of Yog-Sothoth you have in play anywhere. Apply results as kills and pains to enemy factions in the chosen area. You choose which faction receives the results, but they choose which of their units takes each result. No battle-type abilities apply. You choose where each unit is pained, ignoring normal pain rules.
**Strategic notes:** This is your sky laser, your drone strike, your long-range assassination tool. At maximum strength (2 Spawns + 3 Abominations = 5 dice), this can reliably snipe isolated great old ones for just 2 Power without putting any of your own units at risk. Do not use this on fewer than 4 dice; the blank-out risk is too high on 1-3 dice. The pain results are often underestimated: because you choose where pained units go, you can shove an enemy great old one into a meat grinder area controlled by another player who acts before them. This can effectively kill a GOO without rolling a single kill. Beyond sniping, Dread Curse is excellent for clearing a few units off a Gate you want to steal. Just do not get addicted to spamming it; 2 Power per use adds up fast.

### Dragon Ascending
**Unlock condition:** Choose any available spellbook requirement when earned.
**Effect:** Once per game, at any time, set your Power to equal the current Power of one chosen enemy faction. Flip this spellbook face down after use.
**Strategic notes:** One of the most magical abilities in the entire game. The perfect use feels like genius; the wrong use feels like a disaster. The ideal play pattern is to spend your own Power aggressively (summon, ritual, battle) to get as close to zero as possible, then pop Dragon Ascending when an opponent still has 10+ Power. This effectively doubles your output for the round. You might also use it at the start of an action phase if someone gathered 16-17 Power and you can match them immediately. In emergencies, popping it for just 5-6 Power to defend critical Gates in a low-resource game is acceptable. Build your intuition for this over many games; there is no single correct answer for when to use it.

### Dragon Descending
**Unlock condition:** Choose any available spellbook requirement when earned.
**Effect:** Once per game, when you perform a Ritual of Annihilation, you receive twice the normal doom points. Flip this spellbook face down after use.
**Strategic notes:** This is your closer, your win condition, the reason experienced players fear Opener in the late game. The magic number is 15-16 doom. If you enter a doom phase at that doom count with 4 Gates plus Yog-Sothoth (who counts as a Gate), you collect 5 doom from Gates normally, then ritual for 10 doom (doubled from 5) plus an Elder Sign. That puts you at roughly 30-31 doom, which is frequently enough to win. If you look at recorded Opener victories, a huge number of them land right around 30-31 doom for exactly this reason. The challenge is reaching that setup without tipping off the table. Experienced opponents will be counting your doom and will call you out if you approach that magic number with enough Gates to threaten a win. Distract, deflect, and disguise your doom count as best you can.

### They Break Through
**Unlock condition:** Choose any available spellbook requirement when earned.
**Effect:** Ongoing. You can summon monsters at enemy-controlled Gates and abandoned Gates. You do not need any other units present in the area.
**Strategic notes:** This lets you drop a Mutant or Abomination directly onto a distant enemy Gate without spending Power on movement. It helps you earn the "units at 2 enemy Gates" spellbook requirement and is great for harassing doom-focused factions who leave tertiary Gates lightly defended. That said, do not fall into the trap of summoning expensive monsters (multiple Abominations or Spawns) at enemy Gates turn after turn. That spends too much Power. Use They Break Through surgically: one Mutant to threaten a capture, or one Abomination to set up a Beyond One play. In most games you will use this once or twice, not constantly.

## Units

### Cultists
**Cost:** 1 (recruit) | **Combat:** 0 | **Count:** 6 | **Role:** Gate controllers, Million Favored Ones fuel

Opener's acolytes serve double duty. They control Gates like any other faction's cultists, but they also serve as the bottom of the Million Favored Ones upgrade chain. When your acolytes promote into Mutants during a post-battle upgrade, they return safely to your pool where no one can capture them. Re-recruiting them is a 1-cost action that also repositions them anywhere you have a Gate. This cycle of promote-then-recruit is one of Opener's most efficient play patterns, letting you take cheap actions repeatedly while building your monster army.

### Mutants
**Cost:** 2 | **Combat:** 1 | **Count:** 4 | **Role:** Gate holders, upgrade chain link, They Break Through harassers

Mutants are individually unimpressive at 2 cost for 1 combat die, but they serve critical roles in the Opener engine. They are your cheapest monster for holding Gates, your cheapest option for They Break Through summons at enemy Gates, and they sit in the middle of the Million Favored Ones chain. When a Spawn promotes, it splits into as many Mutants as are in your pool (up to 4), making the pool count of Mutants relevant. Mutants are also the result of acolyte promotions, so they frequently appear on the board without you ever paying their 2-Power summon cost.

### Abominations
**Cost:** 3 | **Combat:** 2 | **Count:** 3 | **Role:** Beyond One users, Dread Curse fuel, upgrade chain link

At 3 cost for 2 combat dice, Abominations offer a decent rate and are your cheapest unit that qualifies for Beyond One (which requires a unit costing 3 or more). They sit in the middle of the upgrade chain: promoted Mutants become Abominations, and promoted Abominations become Spawns. Every Abomination on the map adds a die to Dread Curse of Azathoth, so having 2-3 on the board significantly increases your sky laser's lethality. Depending on your opening strategy, you may summon one of these in Action Phase 1 to set up early Beyond One plays or aggressive gate theft.

### Spawn of Yog-Sothoth
**Cost:** 4 | **Combat:** 3 | **Count:** 2 | **Role:** Top of upgrade chain, Dread Curse fuel, Yog-Sothoth prerequisite

At 4 Power for 3 combat dice, Spawns are among the most expensive monsters in the game. They sit at the top of the Million Favored Ones chain and each one on the map adds a die to Dread Curse. Most critically, you must have a Spawn in play to awaken Yog-Sothoth (the Spawn is replaced by the GOO). Protect your Spawns carefully. Losing one to a careless battle or an opponent's attack is devastating because it delays your awakening and costs you 4 Power to replace. When a Spawn promotes via Million Favored Ones, it transforms into as many Mutants as are in your pool, which can flood the board with bodies. This downgrade-promotion is situational but powerful when you need map presence more than raw combat power.

### Yog-Sothoth (Great Old One)
**Cost:** 6 (replaces a Spawn) | **Combat:** 2x the number of enemy faction GOOs in play | **Count:** 1 | **Role:** Mobile Gate, Power/doom engine, late-game combat powerhouse

Yog-Sothoth's combat value scales with the number of enemy great old ones on the map. In a classic 4-player game with 3 enemy GOOs, Yog rolls 6 dice. In a high player count game with factions like Demon Sultan, Windwalker, and Yellow Sign fielding additional GOOs, Yog can roll 10+ dice, sometimes reaching 14-16. The key and the Gate ability makes Yog count as a Gate for all purposes except Beyond One. This means Yog contributes to your Gate count for spellbook requirements, generates Power during Gather Power, and generates doom during the doom phase. Like a Dark Young with the Red Sign spellbook for Black Goat, the longer Yog stays alive, the more value it generates passively. Do not throw Yog into suicidal battles. Keep it alive through multiple Gather Power and doom phases to maximize its return on your 6-Power investment. That said, there are rare situations where Yog's massive dice pool makes a suicide attack worth it to eliminate a runaway leader.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

Opener has the most variable openings of any faction due to its flexible setup. Here are four distinct opening archetypes, each suited to different table conditions.

### Turn 1 (Action Phase 1)

**Three-Gate Opening (Passive/Greedy):**
Build two additional Gates (3 Power each), ending with 3 Gates, 2 Power remaining, and no monsters. This accelerates your 8-Gate and 12-Gate spellbook requirements but leaves you completely exposed. Only do this if you set up far from aggressive factions and ideally if you can talk another player (like Crawling Chaos) into also going for 3 Gates.

**Safe Two-Gate Opening (Balanced):**
Build one additional Gate (3 Power) and summon a Mutant or Abomination with remaining Power. This gives you 2 Gates, a monster for defense or Beyond One, and a stable position heading into Action Phase 2 with roughly 10 Power.

**Double Spawn Opening (Greedy Rush):**
Stay on one Gate and summon two Spawns (8 Power total). This sets you up for an Action Phase 2 Yog-Sothoth awakening. If you get favorable turn order in AP2, you can awaken Yog, immediately take Dragon Ascending, and flip it before anyone else spends their 10 Power. Stealing that 10 Power lets you build Gates and establish a dominant position.

**Aggro Million Favored Ones Opening (Aggressive):**
Set up directly adjacent to or between two opponents (e.g., Arabia between Crawling Chaos in South Asia and Black Goat in West Africa). Summon a Spawn or Abomination, move into enemy Gated areas, earn the "units at 2 enemy Gates" requirement immediately, and take Million Favored Ones. Spend remaining Power on battles to trigger promotions. A Spawn can become 4 Mutants, which in a subsequent battle become Abominations. You can end AP1 with 3 Abominations and a Mutant on just 8 starting Power.

### Turn 2 (Action Phase 2)

Regardless of opening, your Action Phase 2 goals are some combination of:
- Build or steal a Gate to increase the map total
- Awaken Yog-Sothoth if you have a Spawn in play
- Continue Million Favored Ones upgrades with your 10 Power
- Use Dragon Ascending if the timing is right (especially after the Double Spawn opening)
- Move into enemy Gate areas for spellbook requirements

If you went for the safe two-Gate opening, this is your action phase to push the advantage. With 10 Power while some opponents may be recovering, you can build more Gates, start battling for Million Favored Ones promotions, and establish board presence.

### Turn 3 (Action Phase 3)

By Action Phase 3, you should ideally have Yog-Sothoth on the map and be working toward your remaining spellbook requirements. Focus on:
- Reaching the 12-Gate threshold if not already there
- Positioning for Dragon Descending by accumulating doom toward that 15-16 target
- Maintaining Gate control (Yog counts as a Gate, so keeping it alive matters)
- Using Dread Curse to keep opponents honest and protect your position

## Early Game (Turns 1-3)

The early game for Opener is about setting up your engine. Your top priorities are:

1. **Earn Million Favored Ones as soon as possible.** This is your most important spellbook and the foundation of everything you do. The "units at 2 enemy Gates" requirement is the fastest path to this if you are playing aggressively, but "lose a unit in battle" also works if combat happens naturally.

2. **Track the Gate count obsessively.** From the very first action phase, you should be counting Gates. If the table is building aggressively, great; your Gate requirements will happen naturally. If the table is slow to build, you need to start building yourself or talking others into it.

3. **Do not overuse Beyond One early.** Yes, it is tempting to steal Gates all day. But every Gate you steal reduces the total map Gate count, which directly works against your 8-Gate and 12-Gate spellbook requirements. Use Beyond One strategically, not compulsively.

4. **Spend Power efficiently.** Opener has many 1-cost actions: battles (for Million Favored Ones), Beyond One, and re-recruiting promoted acolytes. Chain these together to spend your Power as slowly as possible while extracting maximum value.

## Mid Game (Turns 4-5)

The mid game is where Opener's flexibility shines. Your priorities shift depending on your spellbook progress and doom count:

- **Awaken Yog-Sothoth if you have not already.** The longer Yog stays alive, the more Power and doom it generates passively as a Gate. Every turn it survives is compounding value.
- **Reach the 12-Gate spellbook requirement.** This is statistically the requirement that costs Opener players the most games. If you are stuck at 10-11 Gates on the map, you may need to build 1-2 Gates yourself, which is painful but necessary. In games with Bubastis (Cats never build Gates) or Daemon Sultan (Animate Matter destroys Gates), this becomes even harder. Befriend Daemon Sultan if possible, or at least convince them not to Animate Matter until after you hit 12 Gates.
- **Build toward the Dragon Descending number.** Track your doom carefully. You want to approach 15-16 doom without the table noticing. Distract opponents with combat, Beyond One plays, or table talk to keep attention off your doom count.
- **Use Dread Curse to control the board.** With 4-5 Abominations and Spawns on the map, Dread Curse becomes a serious deterrent. Opponents who leave great old ones isolated will get sniped for 2 Power. This threat alone can shape opponent behavior in your favor.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

The late game is where Opener goes for the kill. Everything has been building toward this moment.

**The Dragon Descending Close-Out:**
The textbook Opener win looks like this: enter the doom phase at 15-16 doom with all 6 spellbooks, Yog-Sothoth alive (counting as a Gate), and 4 controlled Gates. During the doom phase, you collect 5 doom from your 5 effective Gates, pushing you to 20-21 doom. Then you ritual with Dragon Descending active: 5 Gates times 2 equals 10 doom plus 1 Elder Sign. You land at roughly 30-31 doom. If you have picked up any other Elder Signs along the way, you may be even higher. A huge number of recorded Opener victories cluster at exactly 30-31 doom for this reason.

**If you miss the window:** If opponents successfully deny you Gates or knock your doom back, you may need to play a longer game aiming for around 39-40 doom with Dragon Descending used on a later turn. This is less ideal but still viable.

**Late-game defense:** Once you are in position to win, expect the entire table to come after you. Use Dread Curse to deter attacks on your Gates. Use Beyond One to reposition if needed. Keep Yog alive at all costs since losing your GOO means losing a Gate.

## Power Combos & Synergies

- **Million Favored Ones + Re-Recruit cycle:** Battle with acolytes and monsters together. Acolytes promote to Mutants. Re-recruit the acolytes for 1 Power each, repositioning them wherever needed. This gives you cheap actions, free monsters, and map flexibility all at once.

- **Beyond One + They Break Through:** Summon a monster at an enemy Gate via They Break Through, then use Beyond One to yank that Gate away with your monster (if it costs 3+). The original defender's monsters get left behind. This is a devastating 1-2 punch for Gate theft.

- **Dread Curse + pain positioning:** Roll Dread Curse against an area with an isolated great old one. Even if you roll pains instead of kills, you choose where the pained unit goes. Pain the GOO into an area controlled by an aggressive third player who will finish it off.

- **Dragon Ascending + Dragon Descending timing:** Spend your Power aggressively (summon, ritual, battle), pop Dragon Ascending to steal 10+ Power from an opponent, then use that Power to set up your Dragon Descending ritual turn. This double-dragon play can compress two turns of work into one.

- **Million Favored Ones + defensive battles:** When a great old one moves into your Gate threatening to capture your acolyte, battle them even if you expect to lose. Your acolyte promotes to a Mutant (safe from capture since it is now a monster), and you have denied the capture. The acolyte is safely in your pool for a 1-cost re-recruit later.

- **Yog-Sothoth as passive income:** Yog counts as a Gate for Power gathering and doom scoring. Over multiple rounds, it pays for its 6-Power cost and then some. Protecting Yog is like protecting a Gate that also rolls combat dice.

## Factions to Watch Out For

**Daemon Sultan** is potentially your worst matchup in the current meta. Animate Matter can destroy Gates, directly undermining your 12-Gate spellbook requirement. If Daemon Sultan is at the table, try to befriend them early. At minimum, negotiate that they hold off on Animate Matter until after you reach 12 Gates. Failing that, you are in for a very difficult game.

**Bubastis (Cats)** never build Gates, which hurts your Gate count requirements. The Moon counts as a Gate, but that is still one fewer Gate being built on the map compared to a traditional faction. Cats also like to park units at your Gates, though you can battle them for Million Favored Ones value.

**Crawling Chaos** with Flight can capture your exposed acolytes at second and third Gates. If Crawling Chaos is at the table and has Flight, think twice about a greedy three-Gate opening. On the other hand, Crawling Chaos often wants three Gates for their own reasons, which helps your Gate count.

**Any faction that avoids building Gates** hurts you passively. Pay attention to factions that are Gate-light and compensate by building Gates yourself or convincing others to build.

## Matchups

### vs Great Cthulhu
Cthulhu is a straightforward combat faction that builds Gates and fields monsters. The Gates they build help your spellbook requirements, which is nice. Be very careful about Dread Curse-sniping Cthulhu himself, because if you remove the South Pacific Gate with Beyond One, Cthulhu cannot reawaken until another Gate appears there. That can be a devastating play.

### vs Black Goat
Black Goat tends to build Gates and play a doom-focused game, which helps your Gate count. Their monsters are individually weak but numerous, making them decent Million Favored Ones targets. Watch out for getting overwhelmed by sheer numbers, and do not let Shub-Niggurath camp near your Gates unchallenged.

### vs Crawling Chaos
Flight makes your exposed acolytes vulnerable to capture, so be cautious with greedy openings. On the positive side, Crawling Chaos often builds multiple Gates early, which accelerates your Gate requirements. Nyarlathotep isolated is a prime Dread Curse target. Catch them slipping and snipe them for 2 Power.

### vs Yellow Sign
Yellow Sign is doom-focused and often builds Gates, helping your count. Their Desecration tokens can be annoying, but you can use Beyond One to move Gates away from Desecrated areas. Yog-Sothoth's combat value increases with more enemy GOOs in play, and Hastur plus the King in Yellow means more dice for Yog.

### vs Sleeper
Sleeper tends to be passive early and builds Gates in its own corner. Their Gates help your count but their defensive posture means fewer Million Favored Ones opportunities from conflict. Tsathoggua is dangerous to approach carelessly but can be sniped with Dread Curse if isolated.

### vs Windwalker
Windwalker needs to remove their starting Gate from the Arctic to awaken Ithaqua. If you Beyond One that Gate away before they do, it is a devastating disruption. Windwalker also tends to field multiple units, giving you Million Favored Ones opportunities in border conflicts. Ithaqua adds dice to Yog's combat through enemy GOO scaling.

### vs Tcho-Tcho
Tcho-Tcho have a starting glyph restriction on their variable setup. Their unique High Priests can be annoying to deal with, but their monsters are generally manageable for Million Favored Ones purposes. Track whether their Gate placements are contributing to your 12-Gate count.

### vs Ancients
Ancients have their own variable setup but are restricted to glyph areas. They tend to play defensively behind their Cathedrals. Their Gate-building habits vary, so track the Gate count carefully. Dread Curse can help you clear Cathedrals or Cathedral defenders from a distance.

### vs Daemon Sultan
Your hardest matchup. Animate Matter can destroy Gates, which directly attacks your most difficult spellbook requirement. Daemon Sultan does build Gates, but they can also blow them up. Diplomacy is your best tool here. Befriend them, trade favors, do whatever it takes to keep Gates on the map until you hit 12. After that, let them Animate Matter to their heart's content.

### vs Bubastis
Cats never build Gates and the Moon only counts as one Gate. This passively hurts your Gate requirements. Cats also like to park their units at your Gates, but you can battle them for Million Favored Ones value, so they may inadvertently fuel your upgrade engine. Track the Gate count even more carefully in games with Bubastis.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Getting addicted to Beyond One gate-stealing.** It feels amazing to steal Gates all game, but every Gate you steal is one fewer Gate on the map. If you steal 3 Gates and nobody rebuilds, you may never reach 12 Gates for your spellbook. Use Beyond One strategically, not compulsively.

2. **Ignoring the 12-Gate spellbook requirement.** This is the number one reason Opener players lose. You play an incredible game, you have a dominant board position, but the game ends with only 10-11 Gates on the map and you never earned your sixth spellbook. Always, always track the Gate count.

3. **Forcing Million Favored Ones with too few units.** Promoting a single Mutant to an Abomination after a 1-Power battle saves you zero Power (2 + 1 = 3, which equals the Abomination's summon cost). You need multiple units in the battle area for the promotions to generate real value.

4. **Overusing Channel Power.** Re-rolling 2-3 blank dice for 1 Power each is a trap. The expected value is too low. Save Channel Power for battles where you have 5+ blanks to re-roll.

5. **Using Dread Curse on too few dice.** Rolling 1-3 dice for Dread Curse has too high a chance of blanking out. Wait until you have 4-5 Abominations and Spawns on the map before relying on it.

6. **Using Dragon Ascending or Dragon Descending at the wrong time.** These are once-per-game abilities. A wasted Dragon Ascending for 3 Power or a Dragon Descending on a 2-Gate ritual is catastrophic. Be patient, build intuition, and fire these abilities when they will have maximum impact.

7. **Letting Spawns die carelessly.** Spawns cost 4 Power and are your prerequisite for awakening Yog-Sothoth. Losing one to an avoidable battle sets you back enormously. Protect them.

8. **Summoning too many expensive monsters via They Break Through.** Dropping multiple Abominations or Spawns at enemy Gates is tempting but expensive. One surgical summon is fine; a pattern of it drains your Power for marginal returns.

## Tips & Tricks from the Podcast

- **Your acolytes' safest location is in your pool.** After they promote to Mutants via Million Favored Ones, they cannot be captured. Re-recruiting is a 1-cost action that repositions them exactly where you need them. This promote-recruit cycle is one of your most efficient plays.

- **Use Beyond One to disrupt specific spellbook requirements.** The South Pacific Gate is required for Cthulhu to reawaken. The Arctic Gate matters for Windwalker. Tcho-Tcho needs their starting Gate. If you Beyond One these Gates away, you can lock opponents out of key abilities.

- **Beyond One is even more powerful on alternate maps.** Citadel areas in Dreamlands, Tome areas in the Library, the Laboratory in Surgery, the Green Pyramid on Yuggoth -- all of these map-specific mechanics involve Gates in specific areas, and Beyond One can exploit every single one of them.

- **Hide your Yog-Sothoth awakening location.** If you have multiple Spawns on the map (via Million Favored Ones promotions), opponents will not know which one you plan to replace with Yog. This ambiguity is valuable.

- **The magic doom number is 15-16.** At that doom count with 4-5 effective Gates, Dragon Descending can close the game in a single doom phase. Distract the table from noticing you approach this threshold.

- **Battle defensively to deny captures.** When a GOO moves into your Gate area threatening your acolyte, battle them even in a losing fight. Your acolyte promotes into a Mutant via Million Favored Ones, denying the capture. You trade a bad battle for a free monster and a safe acolyte.

- **On alternate maps, Beyond One can rescue glaciered Gates** from Primeval Earth by moving them to unfrozen areas. Keep this in mind if you play that map.

- **Befriend Daemon Sultan.** If they are at the table, Animate Matter is your biggest threat. Negotiate, trade favors, do whatever it takes to keep Gates intact until you hit 12.

- **Spend Power as slowly as possible.** Chain 1-cost actions (battle, Beyond One, recruit) to outlast opponents in the action phase. When everyone else is tapped out, you still have options.

- **Consider the house rule:** If Opener is underperforming in your group, try changing the 12-Gate requirement to 10 Gates for 4-player games. This small adjustment can make the faction significantly more competitive without breaking anything.
