# Tcho-Tcho

## Overview

The Tcho-Tcho are a tribe of cannibals who have discovered the primordial Great Old One Ubbo-Sathla and bent it to their will -- an inversion of the usual relationship between mortals and cosmic entities. This is one of the premier engine factions in Cthulhu Wars, built to accumulate Doom rapidly through relentless rituals while staying out of major conflicts. The Tcho-Tcho are a polarizing faction: players either love them or rarely touch them. They are often called linear and self-indulgent, preferring to turtle up behind a couple of Gates and ritual into the wind rather than interact heavily with opponents. But that is a legitimate playstyle, and when executed well, the Tcho-Tcho can explode in Doom if left unchecked. This is a classical villain faction -- you are not the good guys, so do not be offended when the table comes after you.

With the introduction of Onslaught 4, the Tcho-Tcho gained the Tribes system. When you begin play, you choose your tribe: Sang, Leng, or Sarcomand. All tribes share the same faction board and three universal Spellbooks (Hierophant, Soulless, and Terror), but each tribe has three unique tribal Spellbooks of its own. You do not need to reveal your tribe until you take a tribal Spellbook, adding a layer of mind games to the early game. Do not choose Sarcomand unless the game includes neutral Great Old Ones and monsters.

## Faction Identity & Playstyle

The Tcho-Tcho are defined by three characteristics: relentless ritualing, built-in High Priests, and explosive Doom tempo. More than any other faction, the Tcho-Tcho want to perform Rituals of Annihilation every single turn, even if it costs seven or eight Power to do so. Every point of Doom matters for this faction.

Their unique faction ability, **Sycophancy**, taxes every other player at the table during the Doom phase: when an enemy performs a Ritual of Annihilation, they must either give the Tcho-Tcho one Doom or earn one fewer Doom themselves. This is a low-key but powerful ability that discourages opponents from ritualing and provides a steady trickle of extra Doom.

The Tcho-Tcho also have three High Priests built directly into their faction, giving them unmatched flexibility. High Priests serve as Cultists that generate Power during Gather Power, and their Unspeakable Oath ability lets you sacrifice them at any time to gain two Power. This means the Tcho-Tcho can burst back into action after everyone else has passed, spending four to six recovered Power to move and build Gates when no one can stop them.

This faction has an exceptionally easy set of Spellbook requirements and can be one of the first players at the table to earn all six books. The tradeoff is that the faction is not particularly strong in combat -- Ubbo-Sathla starts at zero combat dice and grows slowly, and Proto-Shoggoths are modest one-die monsters. The Tcho-Tcho win through tempo, not through force.

## Spellbook Abilities

### Hierophant (Universal)
**Unlock condition:** Any of the six standard Spellbook requirements (see below).
**Effect:** Ongoing. When you earn a faction Spellbook (including this one), place a High Priest at one of your Gates. If there is no High Priest in your pool, instead advance Ubbo-Sathla's growth counter by one. When using the High Priest expansion, all factions place a High Priest at one of their Gates when you earn a Spellbook after taking Hierophant.
**Strategic notes:** This is your most important Spellbook. Without the High Priest expansion in play, take this first every single time. Over the course of the game, this book represents up to six free High Priests -- that is eighteen Power worth of units you never had to pay for. Always manage your High Priest count so that you have at least one in your pool when you earn a Spellbook; otherwise you only advance Ubbo-Sathla's growth counter by one, which is far less valuable. With the High Priest expansion, the calculus changes because every faction gets a free High Priest whenever you earn a Spellbook after Hierophant. Consider the faction mix carefully -- for example, do not take Hierophant if Crawling Chaos is about to awaken Nyarlathotep and would benefit from a free High Priest to fuel Thousand Forms.

### Soulless (Universal)
**Unlock condition:** Any of the six standard Spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** Ongoing. When captured and sacrificed, your Cultists provide zero Power instead of the normal one Power.
**Strategic notes:** A solid rattlesnake ability that makes it less attractive for opponents to capture your Cultists. Since you tend to have a lot of Cultists spread across your Gates (acolytes plus High Priests), savvy opponents would rather battle you away than capture you. One strong trick: delay taking Soulless. Let your opponents capture your Cultists thinking they will get Power from them, then take Soulless before the Gather Power phase. They will have wasted Power on captures and get nothing for it.

### Terror (Universal)
**Unlock condition:** Any of the six standard Spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** Pre-battle. Choose one: (1) Your enemy's combat total is reduced by one per Proto-Shoggoth in the battle, or (2) your combat total is increased by one per Proto-Shoggoth in the battle.
**Strategic notes:** The choice depends on the situation. If you have fewer units in the area and want to survive, subtract from the enemy's dice. If you are trying to kill a specific target like a Great Old One and have multiple Proto-Shoggoths present, add to your own dice to maximize kills. This decision becomes meaningful once you have three or four Proto-Shoggoths in a single battle. With one or two, the difference is marginal.

### Idolatry (Sang Tribe)
**Unlock condition:** Any of the six standard Spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** One-cost action. Select an area containing another faction's starting glyph, even if that faction is not in play. Move any or all of your units in adjacent areas into the selected area.
**Strategic notes:** This is the Tcho-Tcho's only movement Spellbook across all tribes, and it is potent. The North Atlantic on the Earth map is a standout location because it is adjacent to Arctic Ocean, North America, Europe, and West Africa -- multiple starting areas regardless of player count. Building your second Gate there lets you bounce between locations cheaply with Idolatry, making it very difficult for opponents to dislodge you. A well-positioned Sang player using Idolatry between two locations can make their Gates extremely hard to pick off.

### Martyrdom (Sang Tribe)
**Unlock condition:** Any of the six standard Spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** Post-battle. If your High Priest is killed, all kills assigned to your units become pains instead.
**Strategic notes:** Extremely annoying for opponents. A good Sang player always has a High Priest in the battle area. When enemies go for the jugular, they simply cannot land killing blows. It takes cooperation from multiple players to overwhelm Martyrdom -- single-faction attacks are rarely enough to truly ruin you. Use Martyrdom as needed to keep Ubbo-Sathla alive, but remember that because of Tablet of the Gods, you want your High Priests intact during the Doom phase to earn extra Elder Signs. Do not sacrifice them to Martyrdom recklessly.

### Tablet of the Gods (Sang Tribe)
**Unlock condition:** Any of the six standard Spellbook requirements.
**Effect:** Doom phase. When you perform a Ritual of Annihilation, you also receive one additional Elder Sign for each Gate at which you have any High Priest. Then eliminate all of your High Priests. This is not optional.
**Strategic notes:** This is the book that makes Sang one of the fastest Doom factions in the entire game. To maximize it, you want three Gates with a High Priest at each. The trade-off is losing all your High Priests, which is a lot of Power to give up -- but if you are planning to close out the game, Tablet of the Gods delivers explosive Doom in a single turn. It also makes it trivially easy to reach three Elder Signs for that Spellbook requirement. Opponents playing against Sang must constantly be doing the math on how much Doom the Sang player can earn in a single Doom phase with Tablet active.

## Spellbook Unlock Requirements

The Tcho-Tcho have one of the easiest sets of Spellbook requirements in the game. If you know what you are doing, you will have no trouble earning all six every game, and you may be one of the first players at the table to complete your books.

1. **Earn an Elder Sign** -- You will be ritualing every game. No excuse not to earn this one.
2. **Own three or more Elder Signs** -- You should be performing multiple rituals, and each tribe has a way to earn extra Elder Signs (Sang: Tablet of the Gods, Leng: Fulmination, Sarcomand: Inerrant).
3. **Another faction performs a ritual or has 15 Doom** -- Sycophancy may discourage opponents from ritualing early, but in a close game someone will hit 15 Doom. This is essentially guaranteed in any normal game.
4. **Any Great Old One is killed in battle** -- Almost always happens. You may not be the one doing the killing, but note that Ubbo-Sathla is actually nice to get killed because you can re-awaken it cheaply in the Doom phase.
5. **As an action, remove your controlled Gate in your start area** -- Easy to earn but the question is when. You can use this defensively if someone moves into your Gate before they have unlimited combat -- blow up your own Gate to deny them the capture. On Primeval and Shaggai maps, you can remove any controlled Gate.
6. **Awaken Ubbo-Sathla** -- You will be doing this in the first Doom phase nearly every game. Very easy.

## Units

### Cultists (Acolytes)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | 1 Power |
| **Combat** | 0 |
| **Count** | 6 |
| **Role** | Gate control, Power generation |

The Tcho-Tcho start with six acolytes, the standard Cultist. Their sculpts depict robed cannibals holding a skull overhead. Distribute them evenly across your Gates -- every Gate should have between one and three Cultists to ensure you do not lose Gate control from a single capture or kill. With the Soulless Spellbook, captured acolytes provide zero Power to the enemy, making them less attractive targets.

### High Priests
| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | 3 Power to recruit |
| **Combat** | 0 |
| **Count** | 3 |
| **Role** | Power battery, Gate expansion, Doom phase awakening fuel |

High Priests are built into the Tcho-Tcho faction and are one of its defining features. They count as Cultists for all purposes including Power generation during Gather Power. Their Unspeakable Oath ability lets you sacrifice a High Priest at the end of any player's action -- even outside your own turn -- to gain two Power. This can be done during the Gather Power phase, Doom phase, or even the First Player phase to steal initiative. With all three High Priests in play, the Tcho-Tcho have a potential six-Power burst available after all other players have passed, enough to move and build a Gate unopposed. High Priests are also required to awaken Ubbo-Sathla in the Doom phase (at zero Power cost). Without the High Priest expansion, your three built-in High Priests give you a massive advantage. With the expansion, the dynamics shift because Hierophant will hand out High Priests to all factions.

### Proto-Shoggoths
| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | 2 Power |
| **Combat** | 1 |
| **Count** | 6 |
| **Role** | Light combat, Terror Spellbook synergy |

The Tcho-Tcho's only monster. One of the best sculpts in the game -- a mass of limbs, eyes, and teeth bursting out of a dead body like a xenomorph. At two Power for one combat die, Proto-Shoggoths are individually modest, but they become significant when massed thanks to the Terror Spellbook. Three or four Proto-Shoggoths in a single battle can subtract three or four dice from the enemy or add the same to your own rolls. They are cheap enough to recruit in quantity and serve as your primary combat presence alongside Ubbo-Sathla.

### Ubbo-Sathla (Great Old One)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Cost** | 6 Power (action phase) or 0 Power (Doom phase, sacrifice a High Priest) |
| **Combat** | Equal to growth counter (starts at 0) |
| **Count** | 1 |
| **Role** | Scaling threat, Doom-phase growth, Fulmination payoff (Leng) |

Ubbo-Sathla is unique among Great Old Ones. It starts at zero combat dice and grows via its Hell's Banquet ability: during each Doom phase after awakening, roll one d6 and increase the growth counter by the result. This means Ubbo-Sathla can range from a modest nuisance to a 15-20 dice monster by the late game, depending on your rolls. Awaken Ubbo-Sathla in the Doom phase 95% of the time -- it costs zero Power and only requires sacrificing a High Priest (which is effectively three Power instead of six). The order of operations in the Doom phase allows you to awaken Ubbo-Sathla, earn a Spellbook, and still perform a Ritual of Annihilation all in the same phase. That sequence is critical to the Tcho-Tcho's opening. If you are awakening Ubbo-Sathla in the action phase, you almost certainly made a mistake or something has gone very wrong.

## Turn-by-Turn Opening Strategy

### Turn 1 (Action Phase 1)

**Setup:** Place six acolytes and a controlled Gate in an empty area with a faction glyph. Choose the most isolated location possible -- wherever opponents need to spend the most Power to reach you. Antarctica is excellent if Windwalker is not in the game. Avoid setting up in a Windwalker starting area, as it gives them a free Spellbook.

You have three main opening lines:

- **Opening A (Two Gates):** Move an acolyte to an adjacent area, build a second Gate, recruit a High Priest, move the High Priest to the new Gate. You end with two lightly defended Gates and multiple Cultists on each. Best when no aggressive faction is adjacent.
- **Opening B (Fortify):** Stay on one Gate. Recruit two High Priests and a Proto-Shoggoth. You end with a well-defended single Gate. Safer but slower on Doom tempo.
- **Opening C (Rush Spellbooks):** Give up your starting Gate (earning that Spellbook requirement), take Hierophant immediately to get a free High Priest, then use your remaining eight Power to rebuild the Gate and develop. Greedy but fast. Experienced opponents will punish this.

No matter which opening you choose, you must have at least one High Priest in play before the Doom phase.

### Doom Phase 1 (Critical Sequence)

This is scripted and should happen the same way nearly every game:

1. Sacrifice your High Priest and awaken Ubbo-Sathla at your Gate for zero Power.
2. Earn a Spellbook. Take Hierophant (if you have not already) to get a free High Priest replacing the one you just sacrificed.
3. Perform a Ritual of Annihilation. Earn one to two Doom plus an Elder Sign, which triggers another Spellbook. Take your second book and get another High Priest from Hierophant.

You exit the first Doom phase with Ubbo-Sathla in play, two Spellbooks, two High Priests, an Elder Sign, and the growth counter rolling.

### Turn 2 (Action Phase 2)

You are probably on three to five Power post-ritual with one or two Gates and two High Priests plus acolytes. Other players are likely spending this phase awakening their own Great Old Ones, so it is relatively safe. Recruit a third High Priest and consider passing. You have the potential to pop High Priests after everyone else is out of Power to build another Gate uncontested. If you are on one Gate with two High Priests and all your acolytes, that is still ten Power at Gather Power, which is a strong position.

### Turn 3 (Action Phase 3)

Continue ritualing. Earn your remaining Spellbooks through natural gameplay -- the three Elder Signs requirement is typically your hardest one and comes from continued rituals plus tribal Elder Sign generation. By this point you should have most or all of your books and be settling into your Doom engine.

## Early Game (Turns 1-3)

The early game for Tcho-Tcho is about establishing your Doom engine as quickly and efficiently as possible. Awaken Ubbo-Sathla in the first Doom phase, earn two Spellbooks immediately, and begin ritualing every turn. Build a second Gate if the opportunity presents itself, but do not overextend. Every Gate you control should have one to three Cultists, possibly a Proto-Shoggoth, and you should distribute your forces evenly. This faction is not good at moving, so try to keep your Gated areas adjacent to each other so you can redeploy defensively.

The Tcho-Tcho get weaker as the game progresses because ritual costs increase over time. This means your early rituals are your most efficient ones -- do not skip them.

## Mid Game (Turns 4-5)

By mid game you should have all or nearly all of your Spellbooks and be ritualing every Doom phase on one to three Gates. You may be spending most of your Power just on the ritual itself, and that is fine. The Tcho-Tcho's job is to collect five to seven Doom every turn from rituals. Only skip a ritual if the Power saved would let you claim multiple Gates in a single action phase.

Use your High Priests aggressively for tempo. Pop them to build Gates after opponents have passed, or to reposition for critical moves. If you can stay on ten to twelve Power heading into each Doom phase, you are in excellent shape. Talk the other players out of attacking you if you can, but against experienced opponents, expect pressure. Make it so they need to fully commit to take your Gates -- spread your Cultists wisely and keep Proto-Shoggoths as deterrents.

## Late Game & Doom Rush

The late game varies significantly by tribe. For Sang, you are looking to execute one massive Tablet of the Gods turn: three Gates, a High Priest at each, ritual plus three extra Elder Signs, and close out the game. For Leng, you are engineering a Fulmination battle where Ubbo-Sathla is killed in a massive fight and you earn one Elder Sign per unit killed on both sides. For Sarcomand, you are leveraging neutral Great Old Ones at enemy Gates via Inerrant for extra Elder Signs during rituals.

Regardless of tribe, the late game for Tcho-Tcho is about executing your win condition before opponents can shut you down. You may have to make hard choices about whether to ritual or spend Power on positioning. Almost always ritual -- the only exception is when spending that Power on claiming several Gates would set up an even bigger Doom turn next round.

## Power Combos & Synergies

- **Hierophant + Ritual Tempo:** Every Spellbook you earn generates a free High Priest, which generates Power and can be sacrificed for burst actions. This self-reinforcing loop is the backbone of the faction.
- **High Priest Pop + Late Gate Building:** After all opponents pass, sacrifice one or two High Priests for four Power, then move and build a Gate uncontested. This is one of the Tcho-Tcho's signature moves.
- **Soulless + Cultist Density:** Having many Cultists across your Gates becomes a trap for opponents -- capturing them yields nothing with Soulless active.
- **Terror + Massed Proto-Shoggoths:** Three or four Proto-Shoggoths in a battle can swing combat dramatically, either subtracting dice from the enemy or adding to your own.
- **Martyrdom + High Priest in Battle (Sang):** All kills against you become pains as long as a High Priest dies. Virtually unkillable in single-faction attacks.
- **Tablet of the Gods + Three Gates with High Priests (Sang):** Ritual plus three extra Elder Signs in a single Doom phase for a massive Doom spike.
- **Fulmination + Large Battle (Leng):** Engineer a fight where Ubbo-Sathla is killed alongside many units on both sides. Each kill is an Elder Sign. Can swing ten or more Doom in one battle.
- **Surprise + Dark Rituals (Leng):** Use Surprise to place a Proto-Shoggoth in an enemy's start area, then recruit a High Priest there. Fire Dark Rituals to extort two Power or two Doom from that player.
- **Doomsday + Inerrant (Sarcomand):** Grab a free independent Great Old One, park it at an enemy Gate, then earn extra Elder Signs when you ritual. Multiple Great Old Ones multiply this effect.
- **Sycophancy + Ancient Sorcery (Sleeper):** If Sleeper copies Sycophancy with Ancient Sorcery, two Sycophancy taxes at once becomes brutally punishing for the table, especially in high-player-count games.

## Factions to Watch Out For

The Tcho-Tcho are a villain faction and should expect aggression from the entire table. The biggest threats are factions with strong early-game combat that can strip your Gates before your engine gets running. **Great Cthulhu** is particularly dangerous -- submerging Cthulhu into your area is devastating, and unless Ubbo-Sathla has grown substantially, you cannot contest a battle against a full Cthulhu force. **Windwalker** and **Crawling Chaos** are also problematic due to their mobility and ability to threaten you from a distance.

Any faction that can pressure you early and keep you off Gates is a serious problem. The Tcho-Tcho simply need Gates to function, and without them, your Doom engine stalls. Savvy players at any faction will target your High Priests specifically -- forcing you to pop them defensively means you cannot use them for late-phase Gate grabs.

## Matchups

### vs Great Cthulhu
Cthulhu is one of your worst nightmares. Submerge directly into your Gate area is devastating. Your early combat is anemic and you cannot trade blows with Starspawn. Stay far away, keep Gates adjacent so you can consolidate, and pray Cthulhu has other targets.

### vs Black Goat
Black Goat can flood the board with cheap units that overwhelm your defenses. However, Black Goat also tends to be inward-looking and may not prioritize attacking you. If they leave you alone, great -- ritual away. If they come for you with Shub-Niggurath and Dark Young, you are in trouble.

### vs Crawling Chaos
Crawling Chaos is dangerous because of Nyarlathotep's mobility and Thousand Forms flexibility. Do not take Hierophant early if it means giving Crawling Chaos a free High Priest right before they awaken. Flight lets them reposition cheaply to threaten your Gates.

### vs Yellow Sign
Yellow Sign is typically focused on their own Desecration game and may not prioritize you. However, their King in Yellow pressure can be devastating if they decide to march through your territory. Both factions are somewhat inward-looking, which can lead to an uneasy coexistence.

### vs Opener of the Way
Opener has extreme mobility via their Gate movement and can appear in your territory without warning. Their Dragon abilities make them dangerous in combat as well. Keep your faction glyph token on the map for Idolatry purposes and be prepared for sudden invasions.

### vs Sleeper
If Sleeper copies Sycophancy with Ancient Sorcery, the double Sycophancy tax is absolutely brutal for the table. This is actually one of your stronger matchups from a synergy perspective, though Sleeper's Tsathoggua is a formidable combatant if it comes your way.

### vs Windwalker
Windwalker's large monster force and Ithaqua are a serious threat. Their Arctic positioning can put them adjacent to your preferred isolated starting locations. However, a large Windwalker death ball is exactly where Leng tribe wants to Fulminate -- that massive pile of units means enormous Elder Sign potential if you can engineer the battle.

### vs Ancients
The Ancients play a longer game similar to yours and may compete with you for the "leave me alone" playstyle. Their combat capabilities with Yothans can be formidable. Watch out for their ability to accelerate Doom in the late game.

### vs Daemon Sultan
Daemon Sultan is another engine faction that competes with you for the Doom-tempo crown. Both factions want to be left alone to ritual, creating table tension over who the bigger threat is. Whoever gets pressured less will likely win.

### vs Bubastis
The Cats can be tricky with their attention-demanding abilities. Their mobility and flexibility means they can show up where you least expect them. Do not underestimate their late-game Doom potential -- like you, they can spike Doom rapidly when ignored.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Awakening Ubbo-Sathla in the action phase.** Awaken in the Doom phase 95% of the time. It costs zero Power versus six, and you can still ritual in the same Doom phase. The only reason to awaken in the action phase is if something catastrophic happened.

2. **Not having a High Priest before the first Doom phase.** You need one to sacrifice for the zero-cost awakening. If you enter the first Doom phase without a High Priest, you have wasted your most important tempo window.

3. **Having all three High Priests in play when earning a Spellbook.** With Hierophant, you get a free High Priest per Spellbook -- but only if one is in your pool. If all three are deployed, you only advance Ubbo's growth counter by one. Pop a High Priest before earning a book to avoid this.

4. **Skipping rituals.** This faction lives and dies by its rituals. Even at seven or eight Power, ritual anyway. The only exception is when that Power would let you claim multiple Gates for an even bigger ritual next turn.

5. **Not distributing Cultists across Gates.** Every Gate should have one to three Cultists. If a single capture or kill can strip you of Gate control, you are set up wrong.

6. **Building Gates too far apart.** The Tcho-Tcho are not good at moving. Keep your Gated areas adjacent so you can shift defenders as needed without burning excessive Power on movement.

7. **Giving Doom through Sycophancy as an opponent.** If you are playing against the Tcho-Tcho, take one less Doom from your ritual rather than feeding them. Do not give the most Doom-hungry faction in the game free points unless you are about to win.

8. **Ignoring the High Priest expansion timing.** With the expansion, Hierophant gives every faction a free High Priest. Rushing Hierophant can backfire spectacularly by fueling your opponents' strategies.

## Tips & Tricks

- **Setup location matters.** Choose the most isolated spot on the map. Antarctica is excellent without Windwalker. The farther opponents have to travel to reach you, the more turns your engine gets to run unmolested.

- **The first Doom phase is scripted.** Sacrifice High Priest, awaken Ubbo-Sathla for free, take Hierophant, get a replacement High Priest, ritual, earn another Spellbook, get another High Priest. Memorize this sequence.

- **High Priests are Cultists.** They provide Power during Gather Power. One Gate with two High Priests and all acolytes is still ten Power. Do not forget this when calculating your income.

- **Soulless timing trick.** Delay taking Soulless. Let opponents waste Power capturing your Cultists, then take Soulless before Gather Power so they get zero return on their investment.

- **Gate removal as defense.** If someone moves into your starting Gate area but does not have unlimited combat, you can blow up your own Gate to earn the Spellbook requirement and deny them the capture. Just make sure you still control the Gate when you do it.

- **Pop High Priests to steal first player.** You can sacrifice a High Priest during the First Player phase to gain two Power and potentially take first player from another faction. This is a niche but powerful play.

- **Sang players: aim for three Gates with High Priests on each for Tablet of the Gods.** That is three extra Elder Signs on top of your ritual. Game-ending Doom in a single phase.

- **Leng players: do not force Dark Rituals.** Either the opportunity presents itself or it does not. You can win the game without ever using Dark Rituals. Focus on Fulmination instead -- it is the reason to play Leng.

- **Leng players: seek out death balls.** Find the largest concentration of enemy units -- Windwalker or Cthulhu stacks are ideal -- and crash into them with Ubbo-Sathla and as many Proto-Shoggoths as possible. Kills on both sides count for Fulmination.

- **Sarcomand players: go for the greedy two-Gate opening.** You want eleven Power at Gather Power so you can be first player and get first pick of neutral units from the pool.

- **Counter-play: target the High Priests.** Force the Tcho-Tcho to pop their High Priests early. If they end the action phase with zero or one High Priest, they cannot pull off late-phase Gate grabs.

- **Counter-play: do the math.** Always calculate how much Doom the Tcho-Tcho can earn in the next Doom phase. If you cannot do that arithmetic, you will lose to this faction repeatedly.

- **Tribe head games.** You do not need to reveal your tribe until you take a tribal Spellbook. Use this to your advantage. Experienced Tcho-Tcho players can juke opponents who are trying to plan around a specific tribe.

- **High Priests are your most important resource -- protect them ruthlessly.** Every High Priest lost is a Gate grab denied and a Terror lost. Tcho-Tcho without High Priests is just an underpowered faction with expensive monsters. Keep High Priests behind your front lines and only commit them to battles where survival is likely. *(community insight)*

- **Ubbo-Sathla is a sacrificial weapon, not a permanent fixture.** Especially for Leng tribe, expect Ubbo-Sathla to die in combat regularly. Its value comes from the massive dice it contributes to a single decisive battle, not from surviving indefinitely. Budget Power to re-awaken it when needed rather than trying to keep it safe at all costs. *(Sandy Petersen)*

- **First-player advantage is critical for Tcho-Tcho.** Having the most Power at Gather Power means acting first, which means grabbing Gates and neutral units before opponents can react. Structure your Power economy around being first player as often as possible -- it compounds your High Priest and Terror advantages dramatically. *(community insight)*

## Frequently Asked Questions

*Common rules questions specific to Tcho-Tcho. Sourced from the [official Petersen Games FAQ](https://petersengames.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48000952254).*

### How does Martyrdom work exactly?

Martyrdom is a post-battle ability exclusive to the Sang tribe. If a High Priest is killed during the battle, all kill results assigned to your units in that battle are converted to pains instead. The High Priest must actually be killed, not pained. This means your opponent's kills only scatter your units rather than eliminating them. Note that the High Priest itself is still killed and removed from the board; Martyrdom does not save the High Priest, only your other units.

### Can you sacrifice a Proto-Shoggoth with Terror abilities?

Proto-Shoggoths are monsters, not Terrors. The Terror spellbook gives Proto-Shoggoths a pre-battle ability that either subtracts from the enemy's combat total or adds to your own, but this does not change their unit type. Proto-Shoggoths can be captured, killed, or affected by any ability that targets monsters. They are treated as standard monsters for all rules purposes.

### Does Sycophancy let you copy any spellbook or just certain types?

Sycophancy is not a spellbook-copying ability. Sycophancy is the Tcho-Tcho's unique faction ability that taxes opponents during the Doom phase. When an enemy faction performs a Ritual of Annihilation, they must choose to either give the Tcho-Tcho 1 Doom or reduce their own Doom earned from that ritual by 1. This applies to every enemy ritual, every Doom phase, for the entire game. It is a passive tax, not a copy effect.

### How does Ubbo-Sathla's combat work?

Ubbo-Sathla starts at zero combat dice and grows via the Hell's Banquet ability. During each Doom phase after Ubbo-Sathla has been awakened, you roll one d6 and add the result to Ubbo-Sathla's growth counter. The growth counter is cumulative and never resets, even if Ubbo-Sathla is killed and re-awakened. Over the course of a game, Ubbo-Sathla can reach 10, 15, or even 20+ combat dice depending on your rolls, making it one of the most variable Great Old Ones in the game.

### Can High Priests use both their ability and the standard Tcho-Tcho abilities?

High Priests count as Cultists for all purposes, including Power generation during Gather Power. Their unique Unspeakable Oath ability lets you sacrifice a High Priest at the end of any player's action to gain 2 Power. This is separate from and in addition to any other Tcho-Tcho spellbook effects. A High Priest in battle also benefits from Martyrdom (Sang) if killed, and counts for Tablet of the Gods (Sang) during rituals.

### What happens to Terrors gained through Tcho-Tcho's special abilities?

The Tcho-Tcho do not gain Terrors through their abilities. The Terror spellbook enhances your Proto-Shoggoths with a pre-battle ability, but Proto-Shoggoths remain monsters throughout the game. If you are thinking of the Tcho-Tcho Terror spellbook, it simply adds a combat-modifying effect when Proto-Shoggoths are present in battle. The name "Terror" refers to the spellbook name, not a unit type change.
