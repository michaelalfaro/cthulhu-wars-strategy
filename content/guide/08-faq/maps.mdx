# Maps FAQ

Map-specific rules questions for all Cthulhu Wars maps beyond Standard Earth.

---

## Dreamlands

### How does movement work between the surface and the underworld on the Dreamlands map?

The Dreamlands map is divided into surface areas and underworld areas. Movement between the two layers is restricted to specific connection points -- you cannot freely move from any surface area to any underworld area. Units must travel through designated passages that link the two layers. These passages function like adjacency connections: a unit can move from one side to the other as a normal move action, but only through these specified links. This creates strategic chokepoints where players can block access between layers.

### Are there gate placement restrictions on the Dreamlands map?

Yes. The Dreamlands map has specific areas where Gates cannot be built, and certain areas that start with pre-placed Gates. The underworld areas generally have more restricted gate placement options than the surface. Check the map's setup rules carefully, as the gate placement restrictions shape the entire flow of the game. Some underworld areas are designed as contested battlegrounds rather than gate locations, funneling players toward specific areas for control.

### Does the Dreamlands map change the Ritual of Annihilation requirements?

The Dreamlands map may adjust the number of Gates required to perform the Ritual and the Ritual Track length, depending on the player count. The setup card included with the Dreamlands map specifies these adjustments. Always refer to the map-specific setup card rather than assuming standard Earth rules apply.

## Yuggoth

### How do faction territories work on the Yuggoth map?

The Yuggoth map assigns each faction a home territory consisting of several connected areas. Unlike the Earth map where factions start at their printed locations, Yuggoth gives each player a defined region as a starting base. These territories influence early-game strategy because you begin with map presence concentrated in your territory rather than scattered across the globe. However, territories are not exclusive -- other players can move into and contest your home territory just like any other area.

### What are Brain Cylinders and how do they work?

Brain Cylinders are a mechanic unique to the Yuggoth map. They represent captured consciousnesses that provide various benefits to the controlling player. When you gain a Brain Cylinder (typically through specific area control or combat effects on Yuggoth), you place it in front of you. Brain Cylinders can grant bonus Power, Doom points, or special abilities depending on the specific Yuggoth rules in play. They add an additional resource layer to the game beyond Gates and Doom.

## Library at Celaeno

### How do tome mechanics work on the Library at Celaeno map?

The Library at Celaeno introduces tome tokens scattered across the map. Players can acquire tomes by having units in specific areas and spending actions or meeting certain conditions. Each tome provides a unique one-time or ongoing benefit, ranging from bonus combat dice to extra Doom points to special movement abilities. Collecting tomes creates a secondary objective alongside gate control and combat, rewarding players who explore the map broadly rather than turtling in a few areas.

### What are knowledge tokens and how do they interact with faction abilities?

Knowledge tokens on the Library at Celaeno map represent fragments of cosmic understanding. They are earned through specific map interactions and can be spent for various effects defined by the map rules. Knowledge tokens interact with faction abilities according to standard rules -- if a faction ability references a game resource or token, it applies to knowledge tokens only if the map rules explicitly state so. Knowledge tokens are a map-specific resource and do not exist outside Library at Celaeno games.

## Shaggai

### How do the insect mechanics work on the Shaggai map?

The Shaggai map features insect-themed hazards and neutral units tied to the Insects from Shaggai. These insects populate certain areas of the map and can interfere with player plans through automatic attacks, area denial, or resource disruption. The specific behavior of the insects is governed by event cards or map phase rules that trigger during the Doom Phase or at other specified times. Players must account for insect activity when planning their positioning, as leaving units in insect-heavy areas carries risk.

### What are volatile areas on the Shaggai map?

Volatile areas are special zones on the Shaggai map that can change state during the game. A volatile area may become dangerous, destroyed, or altered based on event triggers, insect activity, or player actions. When an area becomes volatile or changes state, it can destroy Gates, eliminate units, or cut off movement paths. Players need to monitor volatile area conditions and avoid over-investing in areas that may become hazardous. The unpredictability of volatile areas adds a layer of risk management absent from the standard Earth map.

## Primeval Earth

### How do primal areas work on the Primeval Earth map?

Primal areas on the Primeval Earth map represent ancient, untamed regions of prehistoric Earth. These areas have unique properties -- some may grant bonus combat dice to occupying units, others may restrict certain actions, and some have special gate-building rules. The primal area effects are printed on the map or listed on the setup card. They create asymmetry across the map, making some areas more desirable or dangerous than others and rewarding players who adapt their strategy to the terrain.

### Are there prehistoric gates on the Primeval Earth map?

The Primeval Earth map features pre-placed gates in certain primal areas during setup. These prehistoric gates follow all normal gate rules but start on the map from the beginning of the game, creating immediate points of contention. No player controls these gates at the start -- the first player to place a Cultist in the area claims control. This accelerates the early game and creates conflict from the very first round, as multiple factions may race toward the same uncontrolled gate.

## Multi-Map & General

### How do multi-map games work?

In multi-map games, two or more maps are used simultaneously. Each map operates as its own play space, with separate areas, gates, and map-specific mechanics. Players are distributed across the maps during setup. The key addition is inter-map travel: specific areas on each map are designated as connection points that allow units to move between maps. Moving between maps costs a normal movement action but uses these designated connection points as adjacency links. Multi-map games support higher player counts (typically 5-8 players) and dramatically increase the strategic complexity.

### Can units move between maps during a multi-map game?

Yes, but only through designated connection points. Each map has one or more areas marked as inter-map passages. These areas are treated as adjacent to the corresponding passage areas on the other map. A unit in a connection area can move to the connected area on the other map as a normal move action. This means inter-map travel is not free or unlimited -- it requires positioning at connection points and spending move actions, creating natural bottlenecks between the maps.

### Can I use any map with any faction combination?

Most maps are designed to work with any combination of factions from the base game and expansions. However, some map and faction combinations may produce unusual dynamics or require additional balance adjustments. The map's setup card typically specifies any faction restrictions or recommendations. In general, the standard factions (Cthulhu, Black Goat, Crawling Chaos, Yellow Sign) work on all maps, and expansion factions (Sleeper, Windwalker, Opener) are compatible with most maps. Check the specific map's rules for any noted exceptions or recommended player counts.

### How do map-specific monsters interact with faction abilities?

Map-specific neutral monsters follow the standard rules for neutral monsters with respect to faction abilities. They can be targeted by combat abilities, affected by spellbook effects (unless they have specific immunities), and interact with faction mechanics like any other neutral unit. However, if a map-specific monster has a printed immunity or special rule on its card, that takes precedence over general faction ability rules. Always read the specific monster's card text before assuming standard interactions apply.

### Do alternate maps change the number of Gates needed for the Ritual of Annihilation?

Each map has its own setup card that specifies gate requirements for the Ritual, the Ritual Track length, starting gate positions, and player count adjustments. These values can differ significantly from the standard Earth map. Some maps have fewer total gate locations, which may lower the Ritual gate requirement. Others are larger with more gate slots, potentially keeping or raising the threshold. Never assume Earth map values apply to alternate maps -- always consult the map-specific setup card before play begins.
