# Faction Interactions FAQ

Questions about how faction abilities interact -- timing conflicts, ability stacking, and edge cases in multi-faction games.

---

## Combat Interactions

### Does Devour happen before or after Invisibility and Abduct?

All three abilities -- Devour (Great Cthulhu), Invisibility (Crawling Chaos), and Abduct (Crawling Chaos) -- are pre-battle abilities. The attacker's pre-battle abilities resolve first, then the defender's. If Great Cthulhu is the attacker, Devour removes a unit before Invisibility or Abduct can exempt or eliminate units. If Crawling Chaos is the attacker and Great Cthulhu is defending, Invisibility and Abduct resolve first, potentially removing units from the battle before Devour triggers. This ordering can matter significantly -- if Crawling Chaos exempts or abducts all eligible targets, there may be nothing left for Devour to consume.

### How does Howl interact with Devour when Windwalker fights Great Cthulhu?

Howl (Windwalker) and Devour (Great Cthulhu) are both pre-battle abilities. The attacker's pre-battle abilities resolve before the defender's. If Windwalker is attacking into an area with Cthulhu, Howl resolves first and forces one enemy unit to retreat. This could remove a unit Cthulhu's controller was planning to sacrifice to Devour. Conversely, if Great Cthulhu is attacking Windwalker, Devour eats a unit first, and then Howl forces another to retreat. In either case, the attacker gets the first move.

### Can Emissary of the Outer Gods protect Nyarlathotep from Devour?

No. Emissary of the Outer Gods converts kill results to pain results after dice are rolled -- it is a post-battle ability. Devour is a pre-battle ability that eliminates a unit before any dice are rolled. Devour does not produce a kill result; it simply eliminates a unit. The defending player chooses which unit is eliminated, and they can choose Nyarlathotep. Emissary cannot intervene because it only applies to kill results from combat dice.

### How does Demand Sacrifice interact with Berserker Gang?

If the opponent facing Sleeper chooses the "kills become pains" option from Demand Sacrifice, no kill results are applied to Sleeper's units during that battle. Because Berserker Gang triggers when a Gnoph-Keh is assigned a kill, and kills have been converted to pains, Berserker Gang does not generate any bonus eliminations. This makes the "kills become pains" choice particularly strong against a Windwalker death ball, since it neutralizes both the direct kill damage and the Berserker Gang chain. Conversely, choosing to give an Elder Sign and allowing kills to stand means Berserker Gang triggers normally, which can be devastating.

### What happens when Necrophagy Ghouls arrive in a battle involving Cthulhu's Absorb?

Necrophagy is a post-battle ability that triggers after all battle results have been applied. Absorb is used during the battle itself -- before dice are rolled, the Great Cthulhu player eliminates their own units to add dice to the Shoggoth. By the time Necrophagy triggers and Ghouls enter the battle area, the battle is already over. The Ghouls cannot be targeted by Absorb or any other battle ability. They simply arrive, apply their additional pain results to both sides, and then remain in the area. This can clear out surviving units after a battle, setting up Black Goat to claim the area on a subsequent turn.

## Timing & Priority

### When two post-battle abilities trigger at the same time, who resolves first?

When multiple factions have post-battle abilities that trigger simultaneously, the active player (the one who initiated the battle) resolves their abilities first, followed by the other players in clockwise order. For example, if Crawling Chaos attacks Windwalker in an area near Black Goat's Ghouls, Crawling Chaos resolves Madness first (choosing where pained units go), then Windwalker resolves Cannibalism (placing a unit if enemies were killed), then Black Goat resolves Necrophagy (moving Ghouls in and applying extra pains). This ordering can change outcomes dramatically, especially when Madness scatters units before other post-battle effects apply.

### Does Devolve trigger fast enough to prevent a gate capture?

Yes. Devolve is one of the only instant-speed abilities in Cthulhu Wars. It triggers at the end of any player's action, including actions taken by opponents. If an enemy moves a monster into an area containing only your Acolyte on a gate, you can immediately Devolve that Acolyte into a Deep One before the opponent can take another action. Since monsters cannot capture gates (only Cultists can), the presence of a Deep One instead of an Acolyte means the gate is no longer vulnerable to capture. However, the opponent can still declare battle on their next action to try to remove the Deep One. Also, Devolve only works if you have Deep Ones available in your pool -- if all four are already on the map, you cannot use it.

### Can Energy Nexus interrupt a battle that was initiated against Sleeper?

Yes. Energy Nexus triggers just before a battle occurs, as long as a Wizard is present in the battle area. The Sleeper player can take one action originating in that area at its normal Power cost before the battle begins. The most common use is to move Tsathoggua and the Wizard out of the area entirely, causing the battle to proceed without them (or not at all, if they were the only Sleeper units present). This resolves before any pre-battle abilities like Devour, Howl, Invisibility, or Abduct. The opponent who declared the battle still spends their Power on the battle action even if Sleeper's units have fled.

### In the Doom Phase, how do abilities from different factions resolve relative to the Ritual of Annihilation?

Each faction's Doom Phase abilities specify whether they occur before or after the Ritual of Annihilation. Abilities that trigger at the start of the Doom Phase -- such as Blood Sacrifice (Black Goat) and the return of Ancient Sorcery Serpent Men (Sleeper) -- resolve before any player performs a Ritual. Dragon Descending (Opener) modifies the Ritual itself, so it takes effect during the Ritual. Herald of the Outer Gods (Windwalker) also modifies the Ritual cost. If multiple players have Doom Phase abilities that trigger at the same time, they resolve in clockwise order starting from the first player. This ordering rarely causes conflicts, but it matters when abilities like Blood Sacrifice (which eliminates a Cultist) could affect gate control, which in turn determines eligibility to perform the Ritual.

## Spellbook Interactions

### Can Madness redirect a unit that was pained through Necrophagy?

Yes. Necrophagy adds additional pain results to both sides after a battle. Madness applies to all pain results in a battle, including those generated by Necrophagy. Crawling Chaos chooses where all pained units go, regardless of whether the pain came from normal battle dice or from Necrophagy's extra pains. This means Crawling Chaos has complete control over where the Ghouls' pain results send units, which can be used to scatter both sides of the original battle into unfavorable positions.

### Does Passion trigger when Yellow Sign Cultists are eliminated by Groth?

Yes. Passion triggers whenever one or more of Yellow Sign's Cultists are eliminated by an enemy. Groth (Black Goat) is an enemy action that forces opponents to eliminate Cultists, so Passion fires. However, Passion only grants 1 Power total per elimination event, not per Cultist lost. If Groth forces Yellow Sign to eliminate 3 Cultists, Yellow Sign still only gains 1 Power from Passion because it all happens within a single game effect. This makes Groth somewhat less painful for Yellow Sign than for other factions, but a high roll still hurts because losing multiple gate-controlling Cultists is worse than the 1 Power compensation.

### Can Sleeper's Ancient Sorcery copy Crawling Chaos's Flight, and does it also grant Madness?

Ancient Sorcery copies the target faction's unique faction ability, not their spellbooks. When copying Crawling Chaos, Sleeper gains Flight (the faction ability that lets all units move through two areas containing enemy units). Sleeper does not gain Madness, Invisibility, Thousand Forms, or any other Crawling Chaos spellbook -- those are spellbook abilities, not the faction's unique ability. Flight combined with Burrow makes Sleeper extraordinarily mobile for the rest of that action phase, which is why Flight is widely considered the best ability to copy with Ancient Sorcery.

### What happens when Dread Curse of Azathoth targets an area containing a unit protected by Regenerate?

Dread Curse of Azathoth is explicitly not a battle. The card text states that no battle-type abilities apply. This means Regenerate (Great Cthulhu) does not protect Starspawn from Dread Curse kills. If a kill result from Dread Curse is assigned to a Starspawn, it is simply eliminated. The same applies to other battle-specific abilities like Emissary of the Outer Gods, Eternal (Rhan-Tegoth), Demand Sacrifice, Howl, Invisibility, and any other ability that triggers during or in response to battle. Dread Curse bypasses all of them.

## Special Cases

### What happens if Yog-Sothoth (who counts as a gate) is in the same area as a regular gate?

Yog-Sothoth counts as a gate for all purposes except Beyond One. If Yog-Sothoth is in an area that also contains a regular gate, both are counted separately. This means Opener could have two "gates" in the same area for Power generation and Ritual purposes. However, enemy Cultists still cannot control Yog-Sothoth -- it is always under Opener's control as long as it is in play. If an opponent captures the regular gate in that area, Yog-Sothoth remains and Opener still benefits from it. This interaction is relevant when calculating gate counts for Ritual eligibility.

### Can Zingaya convert a Cultist that has Frenzy (Black Goat) or one protected by Ferox (Windwalker)?

Zingaya (Yellow Sign) targets enemy Cultists regardless of any spellbook buffs they might have. Frenzy gives Black Goat Cultists combat dice, but it does not change their unit type -- they are still Cultists and are valid targets for Zingaya. Similarly, Ferox prevents Windwalker's Cultists from being captured by enemy monsters, but Zingaya is not a capture action -- it is a transformation. Zingaya converts an enemy Cultist into an Undead under Yellow Sign's control. Since it is not a capture, Ferox does not block it. This makes Zingaya a useful counter to Windwalker's otherwise sticky gate defenses.

### If Crawling Chaos has Madness and Windwalker has Cannibalism, and both trigger after the same battle, which resolves first?

Both are post-battle abilities. The attacker's post-battle abilities resolve first, then the defender's, then other players' abilities resolve in clockwise order. Madness determines where all pained units retreat to, and this must be resolved before units actually move. Cannibalism checks whether enemy units were killed and places a replacement unit. Since pain placement (Madness) and the kill check (Cannibalism) look at the same set of battle results, the ordering matters. Madness resolves first to determine where pains go, then Cannibalism places a unit. Notably, the Cannibalism replacement unit appears after pain movement is determined, so Madness cannot redirect the newly placed Cannibalism unit -- it was not part of the original battle.

### Does the Ice Age token tax Submerge or Unsubmerge?

The Ice Age token taxes any enemy action that ends in the Ice Age area. Submerging out of an Ice Age area is free because the action ends with the units removed from the map, not in the Ice Age area. However, unsubmerging (emerging) into an Ice Age area does cost an extra Power, because the action ends with units being placed in that area. This matters when Great Cthulhu wants to pop up in an area Windwalker has Ice Aged -- the normally free unsubmerge action now costs 1 Power. Windwalker players can use Ice Age to discourage Cthulhu from emerging in key areas.
