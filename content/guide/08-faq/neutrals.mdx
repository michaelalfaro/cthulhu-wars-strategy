# Neutrals & Terrors FAQ

Questions about neutral units, cosmic terrors, independent Great Old Ones, and neutral spellbook mechanics.

---

## Neutral Monster Mechanics

### How do neutral monster loyalty cards work?

When you gain a neutral monster through a loyalty card, you take the monster figure and place it in the area specified by the card (or according to the rules for that specific monster). The loyalty card stays in front of you as a reminder that you control the monster. The monster acts as one of your units for all purposes -- it moves with your units, fights in your battles, and counts toward your area control. If the monster is killed, it returns to your pool and can be re-summoned according to the rules on its loyalty card.

### Can I lose control of a neutral monster once I have its loyalty card?

Under normal circumstances, no. Once you have claimed a neutral monster's loyalty card, you retain control of that monster for the rest of the game. It does not revert to neutral status if killed -- it returns to your unit pool and can be brought back. However, specific game effects or variant rules may override this. Always check the specific monster's card text for any exceptions.

### Do neutral monsters count toward spellbook unlock requirements?

It depends on the specific requirement. Neutral monsters count as your units for purposes like "have X units in an area" or area control. However, they do not count as faction-specific unit types. For example, a neutral monster controlled by Great Cthulhu does not count as a Deep One or Starspawn for spellbook requirements that reference those specific unit types. If a requirement says "have 4 Monsters on the map," a neutral monster does count because it is a Monster-type unit under your control.

### What happens when a neutral monster is killed -- does it return to the general pool?

No. If a neutral monster is controlled by a player (via a loyalty card), it returns to that player's unit pool when killed, just like any other unit. The player can re-summon it on a future turn by paying the appropriate cost. Only truly uncontrolled neutral monsters (those not yet claimed by any player) return to the neutral pool when eliminated.

## Independent Great Old Ones

### How do independent Great Old Ones like Cthugha and Bokrug work?

Independent Great Old Ones from the GOO packs (such as Cthugha, Bokrug, Ghatanotoa, Chaugnar Faugn, and Mother Hydra) are not tied to any faction. Any player can awaken them by meeting the specified conditions and paying the Power cost listed on the GOO's card. Once awakened, the independent GOO is controlled by that player and acts as part of their forces. Each independent GOO comes with its own spellbook that the controlling player gains access to.

### Can multiple players compete to awaken the same independent Great Old One?

Yes, but only one player can awaken each independent GOO. The first player to meet the awakening conditions and pay the cost claims that GOO. Once awakened under a player's control, no other player can awaken it. This creates a race dynamic -- if an independent GOO's abilities synergize with your faction, you want to claim it before your opponents do.

### If my independent Great Old One is killed, can another player awaken it?

No. When an independent GOO you control is killed, it returns to your pool, not to the neutral supply. You retain control of it and can re-awaken it by paying its Power cost again, just like re-awakening your faction GOO. The loyalty is permanent once established.

### How does Azathoth work differently from other independent Great Old Ones?

Azathoth is unique among independent GOOs because it is not controlled by a single player in the traditional sense. Azathoth's arrival is a catastrophic event that affects all players. When Azathoth awakens, it does not belong to the player who triggered it -- instead, it follows its own rules for movement and destruction, typically devastating the map. The specific mechanics vary by the edition and expansion, but Azathoth always represents an existential threat to all factions rather than a tool for one player. Check the Azathoth card text carefully, as its rules are among the most complex in the game.

## Cosmic Terrors

### Can Cosmic Terrors be Devoured by Great Cthulhu?

No. Cosmic Terrors are immune to Devour. This is one of the most commonly asked questions in Cthulhu Wars. Devour specifically eliminates one enemy unit before battle as a pre-battle ability, but Cosmic Terrors cannot be targeted by Devour. They must be dealt with through normal combat dice results or other game effects that specifically state they affect Terrors. This immunity is a significant part of what makes Terrors so dangerous.

### Are Cosmic Terrors immune to faction spellbook abilities?

Yes, with some important nuance. Cosmic Terrors are immune to enemy spellbook abilities that specifically target or affect units. This means abilities like Devour, Abduct, Invisibility (when used defensively against a Terror), Zingaya, and similar targeted spellbook effects do not work on Terrors. However, Terrors are not immune to combat dice results -- they can still be killed or pained through normal battle rolls. They are also not immune to game effects that are not spellbook abilities, such as the effects of certain neutral spellbooks or map-specific hazards.

### What is the Dhole's death trigger mechanic?

When a Dhole is killed in combat, it triggers a devastating effect: the Gate in the area where the Dhole died is destroyed, and all units in that area (from all players) suffer additional casualties. The exact severity depends on the specific Dhole card text, but the core idea is that killing a Dhole is a pyrrhic victory -- you remove the threat but suffer collateral damage. This makes players think carefully before attacking a Dhole, especially in areas with their own Gates or valuable units. Sometimes it is better to pain a Dhole out of an area than to kill it outright.

### How do Great Race of Yith capture rules work?

The Great Race of Yith has a unique mechanic where it can capture enemy units rather than simply killing them. When the Great Race captures a unit, that unit is removed from the game (not returned to the owning player's pool). The captured unit is placed on the Great Race's card as a trophy. This is one of the few permanent elimination effects in Cthulhu Wars, making the Great Race exceptionally threatening. Captured units do not return when the Great Race is killed -- they remain captured for the rest of the game. Players must weigh whether to engage the Great Race or avoid it entirely.

### Do Terrors count as Monsters for game purposes?

Cosmic Terrors are their own unit category. They are not Monsters, not Cultists, and not Great Old Ones. This distinction matters for abilities that reference specific unit types. An ability that says "eliminate one enemy Monster" cannot target a Terror. However, for general rules about units (such as movement, combat participation, and area presence), Terrors follow the standard unit rules unless their card specifies otherwise.

## Neutral Spellbooks

### How do neutral spellbooks work?

Neutral spellbooks come with independent Great Old Ones and certain expansion content. When you gain control of an independent GOO, you also gain its associated neutral spellbook. The spellbook functions like one of your faction spellbooks -- it grants you a persistent ability or a triggered effect that you can use according to its text. Neutral spellbooks are in addition to your six faction spellbooks, so they represent pure power gains.

### Can I use a neutral spellbook if my independent Great Old One is killed?

Yes. Once you have gained a neutral spellbook, you retain it even if the associated independent GOO is killed. The spellbook is permanently yours for the rest of the game. Killing an independent GOO does not strip its controller of the spellbook -- the knowledge, so to speak, cannot be unlearned. This makes claiming an independent GOO valuable even if you cannot protect it long-term, because the spellbook benefit persists.

### Do neutral spellbooks count toward the "all six spellbooks" requirement?

No. Neutral spellbooks are separate from your faction's six spellbooks. Game effects that reference "all six spellbooks" or "your sixth spellbook" refer exclusively to your faction-specific spellbooks. Neutral spellbooks are a bonus on top of your faction's normal spellbook progression and do not accelerate or count toward those requirements.
