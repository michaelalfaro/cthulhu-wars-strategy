## Power & Actions

### How is Power generated during the Gather Power Phase?

Each faction receives 1 Power for every Cultist they have on the map, plus 1 Power for every Gate they control. Some factions have abilities or spellbooks that grant additional Power during this phase. Power is calculated simultaneously for all players at the start of the Gather Power Phase.

### Can I choose to do nothing on my turn instead of taking an action?

No. On your turn you must either perform an action (which costs Power) or declare that you are done for the round. Once you declare done, you cannot take any more actions for the rest of the Action Phase, even if you still have Power remaining. Any unspent Power is lost at the end of the round.

### What happens when all players have declared done or run out of Power?

The Action Phase ends immediately and the game proceeds to the Doom Phase. Players do not need to spend all their Power before passing -- but once you pass, you are locked out for the remainder of the Action Phase.

### Can I save Power from one round to the next?

No. All unspent Power is lost when the Action Phase ends. Power resets each round during the Gather Power Phase based on your current Cultists and Gates on the map.

### In what order do players take actions?

Players take turns in clockwise order starting from the first player. Each player takes exactly one action on their turn (or passes), then play moves to the next player. This continues around the table until all players have passed or exhausted their Power.

## Combat

### How does combat work step by step?

Combat follows this sequence: (1) The attacker declares which area they are attacking. (2) Pre-battle abilities trigger (such as Harbinger or combat-related spellbooks). (3) Each side rolls combat dice -- one die per Combat value of each unit in the area. (4) Each Kill result eliminates one enemy unit (defender chooses which). (5) Each Pain result forces one enemy unit to retreat to an adjacent area (defender chooses which unit and where it goes). (6) Both sides resolve results simultaneously. (7) Post-battle abilities trigger if applicable.

### Are combat results applied simultaneously?

Yes. Both the attacker and defender roll dice and apply results at the same time. This means a unit that is killed still contributes its dice to the battle -- you do not remove casualties before rolling. All Kills and Pains from both sides are resolved together.

### Who chooses which units are killed or pained?

The owner of the affected units chooses which of their own units are killed or retreat due to Pain results. This is a critical tactical decision -- you can choose to sacrifice Cultists to protect more valuable Monsters or your Great Old One.

### Can I choose where retreating (Pained) units go?

The owner of the retreating unit chooses which adjacent area each Pained unit retreats to. However, a unit cannot retreat into an area where it would be the only unit and an enemy Gate is present (it cannot capture a gate by retreating). If there is no legal area to retreat to, the unit is eliminated instead.

### What is the difference between "killing" and "eliminating" a unit?

Killing a unit specifically means removing it as a result of a Kill combat result. Eliminating is a broader term that includes any removal of a unit from the map, whether by Kill results, inability to retreat, special abilities, or other game effects. This distinction matters because some abilities trigger specifically on Kills but not other forms of elimination.

### Do I have to attack if I move into an area with enemy units?

No. Moving into an area with enemy units does not automatically trigger combat. Combat is a separate action that costs 1 Power. You can move units into an area with enemies and choose not to fight, or fight on a later turn.

### Can multiple combats happen in the same area in one round?

Yes. There is no limit to how many times combat can occur in the same area during one Action Phase. Each combat is a separate action costing 1 Power. You can even attack the same opponent in the same area multiple times.

---

## Movement

### Can I move through areas that contain enemy units?

No. Movement in Cthulhu Wars does not allow units to pass through areas containing enemy units. When you move, each unit moves to one adjacent area and stops. If that area contains enemies, the unit remains there (and you may later choose to initiate combat).

### How many units can I move with a single Move action?

A single Move action costs 1 Power and allows you to move any number of your units from one area. Each unit can move to one adjacent area, but different units from the same area can move to different adjacent areas. The key restriction is that all moving units must start in the same area.

### Can Cultists move?

Yes. Cultists can move just like any other unit. However, if a Cultist moves away from a Gate it controls, that Cultist no longer controls the Gate (control requires physical presence). Moving Cultists away from Gates is sometimes necessary but always carries risk.

---

## Gates & Control

### How do I gain control of a Gate?

You control a Gate if you have at least one Cultist in the Gate's area and no enemy Cultists are also present in that area. If enemy Cultists are present alongside yours, neither side controls the Gate. Monsters and Great Old Ones do not control Gates -- only Cultists do.

### What happens if I eliminate all enemy Cultists at a Gate?

If you eliminate or drive away all enemy Cultists from a Gate's area and you have at least one of your own Cultists there, you immediately gain control of that Gate. The Gate piece remains on the map -- Gates are never removed once built (unless a specific game effect says otherwise).

### Can I build a Gate in an area that already has one?

No. Each area can contain at most one Gate. You cannot build a new Gate in an area where a Gate already exists, even if you do not control the existing Gate.

### Does building a Gate cost an action and Power?

Yes. Building a Gate costs 1 Power as an action, but the Cultist that builds the Gate must already be in an area with no existing Gate. After building, that Cultist automatically controls the new Gate. Building a Gate is one of the most important actions in the game.

## Doom & Ritual of Annihilation

### How does the Doom Track work?

Players accumulate Doom points throughout the game. The primary way to gain Doom is by performing the Ritual of Annihilation during the Doom Phase. Some spellbooks and abilities also grant Doom points. The player with the most Doom points at the end of the game wins (modified by Elder Signs).

### When does the Doom Phase occur?

The Doom Phase occurs after the Action Phase ends each round. During the Doom Phase, players may choose to perform the Ritual of Annihilation (if eligible), and certain Doom Phase abilities from spellbooks trigger.

### How does the Ritual of Annihilation work?

During the Doom Phase, each player who controls enough Gates may choose to perform the Ritual of Annihilation. In the base game, the first Ritual performed by anyone costs 5 Power (deducted from next round's Power). Each subsequent Ritual performed by anyone in later rounds costs 1 more than the previous one (6, 7, 8, etc.). The cost escalation is global -- it tracks the total number of Rituals performed across all players.

### How many Gates do I need to perform a Ritual?

You need to control a number of Gates equal to or greater than the current Ritual requirement. In a standard game, the first Ritual requires controlling at least 3 Gates. This gate threshold can vary with different maps or player counts.

### Can multiple players perform the Ritual in the same Doom Phase?

Yes. Every eligible player may perform the Ritual of Annihilation during the same Doom Phase. Each player who does so pays the current Ritual cost. The cost increases by 1 only after all Rituals for that Doom Phase have resolved, so all players performing the Ritual in the same phase pay the same amount.

### What do I get for performing the Ritual of Annihilation?

You gain Doom points equal to the number of Gates you control at the time of the Ritual. You also gain one Elder Sign token, which is kept secret and revealed at end of game (each Elder Sign is worth 1-3 Doom points). The Ritual is the primary engine for scoring in Cthulhu Wars.

### When do Doom Phase abilities trigger relative to the Ritual?

Doom Phase abilities on spellbooks typically specify whether they occur before or after the Ritual of Annihilation. Read each ability carefully -- the timing matters significantly. If an ability does not specify, it triggers at the start of the Doom Phase before any Rituals are performed.

### How does the game end?

The game ends when the Ritual Track reaches its final position. This typically happens after a set number of Rituals have been performed across all players (the exact number depends on player count and map). After the final Doom Phase, players reveal their Elder Signs and add them to their Doom total. The player with the highest combined total wins.

## Awakening Great Old Ones

### What does it mean to Awaken a Great Old One?

Awakening is the action of bringing your faction's Great Old One (GOO) onto the map. Each faction has specific requirements that must be met before their GOO can be Awakened, plus a Power cost. Once Awakened, the GOO is placed in a specified area and can act like other units, typically with much stronger combat abilities and unique powers.

### Can my Great Old One be killed?

Yes, Great Old Ones can be killed in combat just like other units. However, a killed GOO is not permanently removed -- it returns to your pool and can be re-Awakened by paying its Power cost again (you do not need to re-fulfill its requirements). Losing your GOO is costly in both tempo and Power but not permanent.

---

## Spellbooks

### How do I earn Spellbooks?

Each faction has six Spellbook requirements printed on their faction card. When you fulfill a requirement, you immediately choose one of your available Spellbooks to gain. You can fulfill requirements during any phase, and the Spellbook takes effect immediately. The order in which you gain your Spellbooks is a key strategic decision.

### Can I choose any of my remaining Spellbooks when I earn one?

Yes. Whenever you fulfill any Spellbook requirement, you may choose any one of your remaining unchosen Spellbooks to gain. You are not locked into a specific order. Choosing the right Spellbook at the right time is one of the deepest strategic layers of the game.

## Miscellaneous

### What happens in a tie for most Doom points?

If two or more players are tied for the highest Doom total at end of game, the tied player who has the most Gates on the map wins. If still tied, the player with the most units on the map wins. If there is still a tie, the players share the victory.

### Can abilities from different factions interact or cancel each other?

Yes. Many faction abilities can interact in complex ways. When two abilities conflict or trigger at the same time, the general rule is that defensive or reactive abilities take precedence. If there is still ambiguity, the active player (the one whose turn it is) resolves their effects first.

### Does the number of players affect the rules?

The core rules remain the same regardless of player count. However, the number of starting Gates on the map, some map-specific rules, and the Ritual Track length may be adjusted based on player count. Always check the setup instructions for your specific player count and map combination.
