## General Strategy Concepts

### The Elder Sign Economy (The Core Win Condition)

The essential strategy of Cthulhu Wars: you need to collect Elder Signs faster than your opponents. Gates generate Doom points and keep you in the game, but Elder Signs and/or preventing opponents from getting theirs is what enables victory.

However, this is not the only path. A faction can win through a "super turn" -- a sudden gate acquisition rush at the end of a prior turn, or being the last faction standing after a massive combat exchange.

### Power Economy and Tempo

- A dual advantage in Power and initiative is safe and easy to convert into comparative advantage in Spellbooks and Doom.
- The crux of the game is the constant compromise between the rising value of Power and the fluctuating value of each occasion to act. The correct compromise is good timing.
- A solid Power economy translates into the ability to gather Doom, but opponents will react.
- Factions like Black Goat, Yellow Sign, and Tcho-Tcho are inherently better at gathering Doom when left alone, but must be prevented from exploiting their advantages through active intervention.
- The store of Power is the main factor in a conflict between Great Old Ones; any player with a GOO and a monopoly of roughly half a dozen Power can do serious damage to their opponent's economy.

### Area Control vs. Engine Factions

Factions in Cthulhu Wars can be classified as:
- **Area Control factions** -- win by holding territory and denying gates to opponents (Great Cthulhu is the most "Area Controlly")
- **Engine factions** -- build up economic or scoring engines that generate Elder Signs and Doom (Yellow Sign, Tcho-Tcho)

Understanding which type your faction is determines whether you should play aggressively (area control) or defensively while building your engine.

### Metagame and Social Engineering

- Looking like you are not winning, while having a hidden path to victory, is a key meta-skill.
- In games with new players, certain openings (like triple gate on turn 1) look appealing but are easily punished.
- Attacking someone early can cause mid-game political backlash, which deters otherwise optimal plays.
- Promises are not binding in Cthulhu Wars -- always "see the money" before taking any agreed-upon action.

### Getting Your GOO Online

Getting your Great Old One on the board by the second or third round is generally recommended, though difficulty varies by faction. Black Goat, Tcho-Tcho, and some "lesser" GOOs like the Yellow King can get out early. For others (especially Great Cthulhu), it requires more careful planning.

## Faction Strategies - Core Four

### Great Cthulhu

**Designer Tips (Sandy Petersen):**

- **Identity:** All about destruction. The most effective combat units of any faction. No extra Doom point generation, so must use combat to ruin enemy bases and prevent opponents from leading on Doom.
- **Early Game:** Earn Spellbooks quickly. Get Cthulhu out ASAP, even if vulnerable -- once summoned, re-Awakening is easy. The "Kill/Devour" spellbook requirements are far easier with Cthulhu on the field.
- **Late Game:** Use Submerge to strike from afar on critical/vulnerable enemy areas. With Regeneration and Immortal, hurl forces into battle with near-impunity.

**Key Spellbooks:**
- **Devolve:** Keep 1-2 Deep Ones in your Pool to be almost immune to Cultist Capture. Devolve a threatened Cultist immediately.
- **Dreams:** The *threat* of Dreams means enemies dare not leave a Cultist alone on a Gate. You may not use it often vs. experienced players, but the fear of it affects their actions.
- **Absorb:** Shoggoths become the single most powerful combat unit. Only need 1 Shoggoth per attack with plenty of "food." Leave some Cultists/Deep Ones alive to soak up hits rather than Absorbing all.
- **Regeneration:** Starspawn pair with Cthulhu as excellent armor against enemy GOOs.
- **Y'ha Nthlei:** Inhibits enemies. Foes are less likely to conquer your Gates. Assault land Gates relentlessly, leave sea Gates practically unguarded.
- **Submerge:** Single most important late-game spellbook. Submerged Cthulhu creates panic. If re-emerging in an Ocean, can Submerge again immediately next turn.

**Countering Great Cthulhu:**
- Cthulhu has strong but few units. Each loss is a setback.
- Don't put all eggs in one basket. Don't try to kill Cthulhu himself (he comes right back), unless you are Crawling Chaos (Harbinger bonus).
- Strike at secondary, weakly-held Areas and Gates.

**Community Insights:**
- If you don't consistently hold 3-4 gates per Doom Phase, you have little chance of winning.
- In smaller player counts, bully your way to victory. In larger player counts, you need politics.
- You win through attrition, not one spectacular runaway turn.
- Must appear as the 2nd place player or lower.
- **Difficulty:** Variable (scales with player count)
- **Required Aggression:** High
- **Tempo to End Game:** Medium-Slow

**Standard Opening (Turn 1):**
1. Move Cultist into an adjacent ocean area
2. Create Gate in the ocean
3. Summon Deep One in South Pacific (safe option) or Starspawn (aggressive option)
4. Summon Starspawn/Deep One at home gate

**Turn 2:** Summon Cthulhu (take Submerge)

### Crawling Chaos (Nyarlathotep)

**Designer Tips (Sandy Petersen):**

- **Identity:** All about opportunism, striking at the weak and vulnerable. Usually the faction that completes spellbook collection first. Units are not mighty in battle; spellbooks are largely defensive. Focus on harassment and weakening foes over time.
- **Early Game:** Focus on safety and power-building. Fly to set up bases in inaccessible areas. Nightgaunts with Abduct discourage enemies from attacking cultists. Don't need Nyarlathotep for a while; he is stronger later. Most awkward spellbook requirement is often "Capture a Cultist" -- look for any chance.
- **Late Game:** Everything changes. Nyarlathotep can have up to 12 combat dice. Instead of fearing battle, seek it out. Strike at enemy GOOs for Harbinger bonus. Rituals are safer due to Thousand Forms restoring power imbalance.

**Key Spellbooks:**
- **Emissary of the Outer Gods:** Helps keep expensive Nyarlathotep safe from weaker attacks. Good for attacking Monster-held Areas.
- **Abduct:** Early game: protects Gates from enemy Monsters. Late game: less useful (want Nightgaunts to soak Kills).
- **Invisibility:** Place invulnerable Flying Polyp in enemy Area. Cancel out obnoxious enemy units (Starspawn). Particularly good vs. Cthulhu.
- **Seek & Destroy:** Hunting Horrors protect Gates. In late game, Horrors join attacks for free.
- **Madness:** Signature spellbook. Not immediately destructive but scatters enemy units inconveniently over the course of the game.
- **Thousand Forms:** When you spend lots of power vs. enemies, this redresses the situation. Even a low roll pays for the cost, functioning as a free "pass" that retains your Power.

**Countering Crawling Chaos:**
- Units excel at staving off weak raids but are less effective against a major attack. Hit hard.
- Killing Nyarlathotep is a major setback -- he may take a whole turn to recover.
- Cultists have no defensive capability (unlike Devolve, Passion, Frenzy). Vulnerable to Capture.
- Invisibility only works in Battle -- Capture with impunity.
- Let your own Power drop rather than giving undeserved Thousand Forms boost.

**Community Insights:**
- Two strategic centers of gravity: (1) Nyarlathotep + Emissary + Thousand Forms as the centerpiece, (2) defensive Monster synergies once they have spellbooks.
- Capture a cultist or build 2 gates on Turn 1 to capture initiative.
- Building 2 gates only possible if specific factions are absent (e.g., Australia if Cthulhu not playing).
- 11+ Power at start of Turn 2 means Nyarlathotep + Thousand Forms online.
- Madness value scales with how much combat other players are having.
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Required Aggression:** Medium
- **Tempo to End Game:** Medium

**Devious Opening (Turn 1):**
1. Summon Night Gaunt
2. Wait for opponents' actions
3. Move Night Gaunt to area with an enemy cultist but no gate
4. Offer a deal: "If you build a gate here, I promise not to steal it." ALWAYS keep this one deal.

**Turn 2:** Start with 11 Power. Awaken Nyarlathotep, take Thousand Forms.

### Black Goat (Shub-Niggurath)

**Designer Tips (Sandy Petersen):**

- **Identity:** About occupation and expansion. Geographically restricted. Not deadly in battle (no combat spellbooks at all), but units are easily-replaced and numerous. Difficult to destroy. Abilities let you strike enemies almost with remote control.
- **Early Game:** Most common novice mistake: diaspora of Cultists for spellbook requirements. Instead, build up at a sedate rate, ensure units have support and protection. Use cheap monsters to occupy Areas for spellbook purposes rather than Cultists. Thousand Young best used defensively. Create a stronghold for Shub-Niggurath.
- **Late Game:** Ghroth slows and cripples rivals. Battle becomes common, so Necrophagy triggers multiple times per turn. Avatar steals weak enemy bases. Usually fewer Gates than other factions, but Blood Sacrifice compensates: even with 2 Gates + Shub, get 2 Doom and 2 Elder Signs per Ritual.

**Key Spellbooks:**
- **Frenzy:** Only "combat" ability. Excellent defensive and offensive. If foe moves a monster hoping for cheap Capture, declare combat and Pain them back out.
- **Necrophagy:** Use with impunity (Ghouls are free with Thousand Young). Can clean out entire areas, leaving Gates open for capture.
- **Ghroth:** Complex but worth the trouble. Some players focus on Ghroth as main strategy; others use it as occasional boost. Both effective.
- **Red Sign:** More baseline Power than any other faction. Gate-controlling units that cannot be Captured.
- **The Thousand Young:** Summon a single Ghoul for 0 Power as a "pass" while watching other players. Demoralizing for enemies to destroy 3-4 units and see them re-summoned at trivial cost.
- **Blood Sacrifice:** Extra Power per Ritual for extra Elder Sign. Also puts Cultists back in Pool for Avatar/Necrophagy gate-stealing.

**Countering Black Goat:**
- Hard to dig out once settled, but easy to fend off (limited offensive action).
- Monsters are weak with other tasks (Fungi separated for Ghroth, Dark Young controlling Gates).
- Avatar and Necrophagy involve starting weak in the target zone. React immediately and strongly to drive her back.
- Don't try to cure the infection, just keep it within bounds.
- Don't over-focus once she is weak or other enemies will surge ahead.

**Community Insights:**
- Three phases: strong defense early, aggressive mid-game, passive/reactive late game. Knowing what phase you are in is crucial.
- Must take risks that either pay off spectacularly or lose the game.
- Get Red Sign early with Dark Young. Dark Young at 3 Power is a great investment.
- Dark Young controlling a gate is very hard to dislodge (immune to Dreams, Zingaya, Capture).
- Mid-game: use Avatar aggressively, put Shub in harm's way, capture cultists and gates.
- Late game: revert to passive as your units don't scale in combat like others.
- Going from 4 to 6 gates and then Ritualing can win out of nowhere.
- **Difficulty:** Medium to Very Hard (scales with player count)
- **Required Aggression:** Medium (focused mid-game)
- **Political Level:** High
- **Tempo to End Game:** Slow

**Classic Opening (Turn 1):**
- **Shub-first:** Summon Shub-Niggurath (take Blood Sacrifice). Costs all Power, but Blood Sacrifice active from first Doom Phase onward. Turn 2: start stealing gates and recruiting cultists.
- **Expansion-first:** Move cultists into 4 areas for spellbook, then remove 2 for second spellbook. Risk: cultists are vulnerable once spread.
- **Red Sign Gambit:** Remove 2 cultists for spellbook (choose Red Sign), summon Dark Young, move it to adjacent area, build Gate, recruit cultist.

### Yellow Sign (Hastur)

**Designer Tips (Sandy Petersen):**

- **Identity:** Most complicated faction to understand and use. Constrained by strange rules, sometimes seems to play its own separate game. Adept at harassment, stealing Gates, making enemies' lives hell. Nomadic, leaving ruins in wake. Gets actions more quickly than others (double-actions). Units are weak but often free and numerous.
- **Early Game:** Will earn spellbooks more slowly than others. Summon King in Yellow ASAP once safe. Decide strategy: Undead, Byakhee, or Hastur/Third Eye (all effective, different decisions). Consider early Rituals as soon as Turn 2 to bump the price.
- **Late Game:** Focus on finishing remaining spellbooks. Usually not many Gates, so rely on Third Eye or two GOOs for worthwhile Rituals. Hastur gives terrifying combat potential with Vengeance. With Feast, often have the most Power despite lack of Gates.

**Key Spellbooks:**
- **Passion:** Earlier you get this, the safer you are. Can "resurrect" you when out of Power if enemies attack your Cultists. Slight hindering effect on foes.
- **Zingaya:** Biggest Desecration problem is getting enough units. Zingaya gives additional units without a Gate AND removes enemy Cultist.
- **Shriek of the Byakhee:** One of the most flexible actions in the game. Defensive and offensive power. Shriek if enemy invades (protection) or after Screaming Dead/He Who is Not to be Named (oomph).
- **Screaming Dead:** Used A LOT. Don't put off too long; shouldn't be first or last spellbook.
- **He Who is Not to be Named:** Teleport Hastur, immediately attack, kill GOOs. Extra action does NOT have to involve Hastur.
- **Third Eye:** Elder Sign for 2 Power (1 move, 1 Desecrate), plus power source and new monster.

**Countering Yellow Sign:**
- Monsters are feeble but numerous. May need to attack multiple times.
- Third Eye requires both King in Yellow AND Hastur out, plus movement and successful Desecration. Many options to interrupt.
- Keep him out of Africa or the Americas to cripple progress.
- Avoid fighting Hastur directly -- he is the perfect Great Old One killer.

**Community Insights:**
- You don't need many Gates. Usually behind on Doom for the first half.
- Best course: lay low, minimize conflict, set up your engine (Hastur + Third Eye + Desecrate spaces with King in Yellow).
- Don't overdo Desecrating early -- later with Third Eye, it costs half as much Power and yields an Elder Sign each time.
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Required Aggression:** Low
- **Political Level:** Low
- **Tempo to End Game:** Medium-Fast

**3-Turn Opening Strategy (Experienced Players):**

**Turn 1:**
1. Move Cultist to Scandinavia
2. Create Gate
3. Summon Byakhee in Scandinavia
4. Summon Zombie in Europe
5. (Optional: if new player at table, give them 3 Doom as an action, take Passion)
6. Last Power: move Cultist to empty area if safe

**Turn 2:**
1. Summon King in Yellow in empty territory with cultist (take Screaming Dead)
2. Create Gate
3. If Cthulhu/CC summoned their GOOs, go for 4th gate

**Turn 3:**
1. Summon Hastur (take Third Eye)
2. Start moving King and Desecrating for 1 Power (+1 Elder Sign)

## Faction Strategies - Expansions

### Opener of the Way (Yog-Sothoth)

**Community Assessment:**

- **Identity:** Like fighting a ghost. Can strike at any Gate (They Break Through) and Combat gives direct benefits while inflicting harm (Million Favored Ones).
- **In lower player counts (3-4):** May want to curb early aggression in favor of building Gates for spellbook requirements.
- **In higher player counts:** Can acquire Spellbooks almost more rapidly than anyone -- be aggressive from the start.

**Key Strategy Points:**
- **Dragon Ascending** is the most crucial spellbook, even though it can only be used once. Don't wait for the perfect opportunity -- plan ahead and make it happen.
- **Critical combo:** With 11-12 Power after Gather Power, Ritual (even with only 3-4 Gates paying 5-6 Power), then Awaken Yog-Sothoth with remaining Power, then immediately Dragon Ascending. Effectively a free Ritual AND free GOO.
- If the Action Phase ever ends with Opener having 5+ gates, they are very likely to win or push the game immediately into end-game (Dragon Descending + Ritual = 15-18 Doom in a single turn).
- **Dread Curse of Azathoth:** Always look for opportunities. Even without kills, you Pain targets out of position. Undefended solitary GOOs are prime targets.

**Metrics:**
- **Difficulty:** Easy-Medium
- **Required Aggression:** High
- **Tempo to End Game:** Fast

---

### Sleeper (Tsathoggua)

**Designer Tips (Sandy Petersen):**

- Not particularly interested in combat for most of the game. Units harass and debilitate foes outside of battle.
- Can force enemy factions to make sacrifices and capture/sacrifice enemy monsters.
- Brings out ancient sorceries with monsters that appear for free on-map.
- Wizards can teleport and parasitize special abilities.
- **Formless Spawn:** Battle strength equals the number on the map (if all four are in play, each has Combat of 4).

**Key Abilities:**
- Cursed Slumber, Lethargy, Death from Below, and Burrow let Sleeper do more with less, making it the most Power-efficient faction.
- Ancient Sorcery triggered by sacrificing captured monsters.

- [Winning with Sleeper - How is it Done?](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1532392/winning-sleeper-how-it-done)

---

### Windwalker (Ithaqua)

**Community Assessment:**

- A late bloomer. Spellbooks aren't always useful early, no good movement abilities until Ithaqua awakens.
- As the game progresses, units become cheaper, strength increases dramatically, and powerful options appear.
- Hibernate mechanic allows banking Power for explosive turns.

**Key Strategy Points:**
- Starting in Antarctica affects Cthulhu's opening plays.
- The "every other turn Hibernate" is debated -- some argue the math doesn't support it as a rigid strategy.
- Ice Age token placement is strategic: placing it in an area with a solitary cultist and gate essentially locks that area down (too costly for enemies to contest).

**Opening Strategy (Experienced Players, starting in Antarctica):**

**Turn 1:**
1. Summon Rhan-Tegoth in Arctica (take Ice Age token -- place in area with pile of CC cultists, South Pacific, or North America)
2. Summon Wendigo in Antarctica
3. Hibernate

**Turn 2:**
1. Move Rhan-Tegoth to capture a cultist
2. Exploit the power advantage

---

### Tcho-Tcho

**Community Assessment:**

- The most "controversial" faction. Breaks the logic that you must fight and interact to win.
- If left alone, wins faster than any other faction.
- **Take Hierophants first** -- gain 18 Power worth of High Priests for free.
- Build gates in adjacent areas and turtle up.
- Combat effectiveness is fairly weak (only Proto-Shoggoths), defensive in nature (Terror, Martyrdom, Soulless), or purely luck-reliant (Hell's Banquet).
- Holding 2 gates is easy; holding 3 is much harder and makes all the difference.
- For the first couple of Action Phases, combat potential is virtually nil. If opponents don't skirmish early, chances of winning greatly improve.
- Biggest political challenge: not getting ganged up on.

**Metrics:**
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Required Aggression:** Low
- **Political Level:** Medium
- **Tempo to End Game:** Very Fast

**Source:** [Revamped New Player Faction Strategies Reference](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2391048/revamped-new-player-faction-strategies-reference)

---

### The Ancients

**Community Assessment:**

- An exercise in restraint. Huge combat potential in Yothans but most vulnerable to having units captured by enemy GOOs and vulnerable when out of Power.
- Pace summoning of Yothans. Awaken one per Action Phase at most.
- Keep Yothans in pool as long as possible; only summon to respond to threats or deter opponents.

**Three keys to maintaining Power parity:**
1. Careful deployment of Worship Services
2. "Everyone else gets a free unit" spellbook slots (use as bribes)
3. Unmen using Festival (a wonderful 0-power action)

**Key Strategy Points:**
- Reserve Unmen for special occasions. Set up "volunteer capture" with Sleeper if playing.
- Bribe Opener with free Power to avoid Dragon Ascending blowback.
- Better off making opponents come to you. Don't over-deploy with Dematerialization.
- Gates and units best placed in a tight corner of the map.
- **Worship Services** is the MVP spellbook (not Unholy Ground). Take early for 10+ free Power over the course of the game.
- Don't jump ahead with Consecration (acquiring two Elder Signs). Don't put yourself head-and-shoulders above everyone on the Doom track.

**Metrics:**
- **Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
- **Required Aggression:** Low
- **Political Level:** High
- **Tempo to End Game:** Medium (Reactive)

## Faction Matchups and Counters

### Crawling Chaos vs. Great Cthulhu
- CC benefits from killing Cthulhu (Harbinger gives 2 Power or Elder Signs).
- CC's Invisibility is particularly good vs. Cthulhu's powerful but few units.
- Cthulhu's Dreams threatens CC's cultists, but CC has no defensive cultist ability.
- In base game, CC and Cthulhu tend to dominate if other players don't coordinate against them.

### Yellow Sign vs. Great Cthulhu
- Avoid fighting Hastur directly -- he is the perfect GOO killer via Vengeance.
- Cthulhu should strike at Yellow Sign's scattered weak bases, not engage Hastur.

### Black Goat vs. Opponents
- Black Goat is hard to dig out but easy to fend off.
- Avatar and Necrophagy gate-stealing starts weak in the target zone -- react immediately and strongly.
- Don't over-commit to destroying Black Goat; knock her to 1-2 Gates and move on.

### Protecting Against King in Yellow
- Yellow Sign is constrained by needing to Desecrate specific areas.
- Block access to Africa or the Americas to cripple progress.
- Strike at scattered Desecration tokens when convenient.

### Windwalker vs. Cthulhu
- Windwalker starting in Antarctica should affect Cthulhu's opening plays.
- Ice Age tokens can lock down areas against Cthulhu's ocean expansion.

### Stopping Opener
- If Opener ever ends an Action Phase with 5+ gates, they will likely win or force end-game.
- Dragon Ascending is one-use but devastating. Monitor Opener's Power and gate count closely.

## Player Count Considerations

### 2-Player Games
- Cthulhu Wars is emphatically a multiplayer game; interactions are seriously distorted in 2-player mode.
- In 2 player, "Combat" factions (Great Cthulhu) dominate "Infrastructure" factions (Black Goat) because the main combat limiter vanishes (no third party to exploit weakness).
- The Decay marker was added to address the problem of one player running out of Power first -- the other player now pays an ever-rising "Power Tax" for each extra turn.

### 3-Player Games
- Core four dynamics work well. Political considerations become very important -- 2v1 situations are decisive.
- The "look like you're not winning" meta-skill is less useful since there are fewer players to hide behind.

### 4-Player Games (Recommended)
- Considered the best player count for the base game.
- All four factions interact naturally and the political dimension is richest.
- Each faction has natural rivals and allies based on geography and game state.

### 5+ Player Games (With Expansions)
- More factions increase the political complexity exponentially.
- Great Cthulhu becomes much harder to win with (can't fight everyone).
- Faster factions like Tcho-Tcho and Yellow Sign benefit from less attention.

### Independent GOOs in 2-Player
- Tips for getting Independent Great Old Ones into play in 2-player games involve creative placement.

## Map-Specific Strategies

### Standard Earth Map
- The default map. Ocean areas are critical for Great Cthulhu.
- Starting position matters: some factions benefit from being adjacent to multiple empty areas (e.g., Black Goat starting near Africa/South America).

### Primeval Earth Map
- Double-sided, can be assembled into four different maps.
- Each turn, a Glacier piece appears in a polar area and moves south/north.
- Gates freeze over, forcing players into tighter quarters. This fundamentally changes the pacing.
- Late-game area scarcity increases the value of combat-oriented factions.

### Dreamlands Map
- Introduces Citadels -- if you control all Citadels, you win immediately (regardless of Doom track).
- Creates a whole new win condition: you can be far behind on Doom but win through Dreamlands domination.
- Requires splitting attention between Doom generation and Citadel control.

### 6-8 Player Maps
- Larger versions of Earth, Primeval, and Dreamlands maps for larger player counts.
- More area means more room to expand, less early conflict.

## Faction Difficulty and Classification

From the community's "Revamped New Player Faction Strategies Reference" (based on experience running a dedicated meetup group and aligned with BGG win/loss statistics):

| Faction | Difficulty | Aggression | Political Level | Tempo to End Game |
|---------|------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Great Cthulhu | Variable (scales w/ player count) | High | Variable (scales w/ player count) | Medium-Slow |
| Yellow Sign | Easy | Low | Low | Medium-Fast |
| Crawling Chaos | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Black Goat | Medium to Very Hard (scales) | Medium (mid-game focused) | High | Slow |
| Opener of the Way | Easy-Medium | High | Medium | Fast |
| Tcho-Tcho | Easy | Low | Medium | Very Fast |
| The Ancients | Medium-Hard | Low | High | Medium (Reactive) |

**Recommended beginner factions:** Yellow Sign or Tcho-Tcho
**Step-up factions:** Opener or Crawling Chaos
**Advanced factions:** Reserved until players prove themselves
